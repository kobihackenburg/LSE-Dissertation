I've been worried that our economy is heading towards another crash‚Äîand coronavirus is already a serious economic threat. I've got a plan to address the economic impact, and I'm calling on Congress to act immediately. 
My path has been bumpy. I never thought I'd run for any public office, let alone president of the United States. But I got to live my dream, and I got into this fight to make sure everyone else had that same opportunity. 
Agricultural labor has long been intentionally excluded from basic labor laws, like the right to unionize and overtime pay. This was justified with explicitly racist reasons. It's time to strengthen the rights of farmworkers and food chain workers.

Bernie and I both wanted to rein in Wall Street after the 2008 financial crash.I was the one who dug in, fought back, and created the agency that forced the banks to return more than $12 billion to people they cheated.

 I don‚Äôt know how this administration sleeps at night. This destruction is untenable. We need a new president. 
Read my full plan to ensure our federal government is accountable to border communities: 
A few steps to one side of the border shouldn't mean you forfeit basic rights. As president, I‚Äôll work to reverse this decision legislatively to ensure accountability for victims of border patrol violence‚Äîregardless of what side of the border you‚Äôre on. 
We need to get our priorities straight and focus on keeping the American people safe‚Äînot funding a monument to hate. I've introduced a bill to divert every dime Donald Trump is spending on his racist wall to fighting the coronavirus. 
Border communities reflect the best of America, but too often politicians in Washington degrade and divide them for political gain. I've got a plan to stop Donald Trump's militarization of the border and fight for safe, prosperous border communities.

At the same time, overcrowded prisons too often fail to meet basic human rights standards. Under existing conditions, these sentences are inhumane. A president can use her clemency powers to right systemic injustice‚Äîand I plan to do just that.
Data show that people tend to age out of crime and are less likely to recidivate, but thousands of elderly people remain behind bars. Those serving sentences equivalent to life are disproportionately Black and Brown, many for nonviolent crimes or crimes committed as juveniles.
Today I'm announcing that, in a Warren administration, we will create a clemency board that will prioritize cases of older Americans incarcerated for unduly long sentences and establish a presumption of release, unless the board finds a danger to public safety.
The president has significant powers to grant clemency and pardons, and historically presidents have used that power broadly. But today‚Äôs hierarchical process at DOJ results in relatively few and conservative clemency recommendations.
My heart aches for Kaia. This is absolutely unacceptable. No student should have to learn in an environment where there is a threat of incarceration. We need to reduce police presence in schools and invest in the resources and support our students need. 
The Trump administration is bungling the response to coronavirus, putting our public health and our economy at risk. We need a real plan to respond to outbreaks‚Äîand an adult in charge.

In 2012, I ran against an incumbent Republican. He was very popular and had as much money as he wanted from Wall Street. I ended up beating that guy by 7 1/2 points. 
How do we get more women to run for president?Elect one for president.I'm ready. 
I will appoint a head of the FDA who believes in science. 
We need an Attorney General and a Justice Department that believe in actually enforcing civil rights laws. 
I don't owe anything to the tobacco industry. Or the drug industry. Or the prison industrial complex.When I see corruption, I stand up and fight back. 
In the early 2000s I could see what was happening on mortgages, and how communities of color were being targeted. I rang every alarm bell that I could. This is the fight I‚Äôve been in. 
We must treat housing like a basic human right. That means we need safe, accessible housing for everyone. I have a plan for that.  
No one in our country should be paid subminimum wages. It‚Äôs time to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. 
I'll tell you something about us teachers.We see the worth of every human.We love our work.We never give up.
I think the top one tenth of 1% can afford to pay a little more so we can invest in all our kids. That‚Äôs why I have a plan for a  in America: A two cent tax on fortunes above $50 million. 
For a price I could pay on a part-time waitressing job, I finished my four-year diploma and became a special education teacher.That opportunity is not out there for young people today. 
We‚Äôve had 40 years of trickle-down economics. It‚Äôs been a complete failure. So what do we need to do? Build an economy from the grassroots up. 
The Democratic Party is a progressive party. Progressive ideas are popular. 
The gun industry and the NRA are calling the shots in Washington instead of the American people. It‚Äôs corruption plain and simple‚Äîand that‚Äôs why fighting corruption is at the top of my agenda. 
We need to treat gun violence like the public health emergency it is. 
We need a Justice Department and a president who will treat white supremacy as the domestic terrorism that it is. 
We can either have a president who is all about politics and himself, or a president like the one I‚Äôm running to be: A president that gets the job done for the American people. 
Tomorrow, I‚Äôm introducing a plan that takes every dime Donald Trump is spending on his wall, and diverting it to fighting the coronavirus. 
Join us for our  tonight at 10 PM ET on as we talk about our vision of big, structural change‚Äîand how we‚Äôre dreaming big and fighting hard to make it happen.
Woo-hoo! February isn‚Äôt over yet, and we already more than doubled our original fundraising goal, raising more than $21 million‚Äîour best month yet. This is what the power of our grassroots movement looks like. Chip in $1 now‚Äîlet‚Äôs do this together.

I'm fighting for justice and opportunity for Black men in America‚Äîand I want to make sure we center their voices and experiences in this fight. I'm committed to continue listening and learning, and I'm grateful to and for moderating this conversation. 
This is outrageous. We should use every tool at our disposal, including government manufacturing or contracting if necessary, to make this vaccine available to everyone who needs it. Former Pharma lobbyist Azar should stop putting profits ahead of people's lives. 
We are not going to defeat Donald Trump with another arrogant billionaire who has argued for cutting crucial benefits for families that have earned them.The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. Mike Bloomberg is the riskiest candidate. 
I'm about to join to speak about our shared fight for big, structural change‚Äîwatch our livestream from Charleston, South Carolina now! 
I'm devastated for the victims, and my heart is with their loved ones and all those affected by this tragedy.We shouldn't have to live with this constant horror and grief. We need to act now to end the gun violence epidemic. 
Thank you, I‚Äôm honored to receive the endorsement of someone who has dedicated his life to human rights advocacy and fighting for democracy. I'm proud to fight alongside you to build a better country and a better world.

Families took incredible risks to fight for a better education for their children. But our government isn't living up to its responsibilities. Funding is inadequate and inequitable, and public schools are more segregated now than thirty years ago. I've got a plan to fix this. 
I'm grateful for the endorsement. Together, I know we can root out the corruption in Washington and build a country and an economy that work for everyone‚Äîjoin us! 
I believe the women‚Äîand I want to hear their stories. 
I just stepped off the debate stage and I want to say thank you for all the support after the last  Let‚Äôs do it again!  
For me, this is about how we treat other people and how we lift them up. That is why I am in this fight, that is why I am running to be president, and that is why I will be an effective president.  
We cannot ask our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily.  
While Mike Bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on African Americans and Latinos, I was fighting for a consumer agency to protect families from being cheated by Wall Street and the Big Banks.  
My motto ties in directly to Matthew 25: Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.It‚Äôs about how we treat other people and lift them up. That is why I am in this fight. 
I just stepped off the  stage feeling grateful for everyone who tuned in tonight. Together, we‚Äôre growing our movement.February has been our campaign‚Äôs best fundraising month yet‚Äîwill you chip in $2 before midnight tonight to keep it up? 
The filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry, a veto to the oil industry, a veto on immigration. If we want to make progress, it's time to end the filibuster.  
We need to speak to the future we can build together. It's time for a  in America so we can invest in our families and ensure we have universal child care, high-quality public education, universal free public college, and cancel student loan debt.  
People want a chance to hear from the women that Mike Bloomberg and his company have gagged with nondisclosure agreements.If he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let the women speak out and tell their stories.  
Trump has bungled the response to the coronavirus outbreak. I have a plan to prevent and prepare for outbreaks, contain them if they do break out, and push for medical advances to treat emerging infectious diseases. 
Billionaires don‚Äôt scare me. Big Oil doesn‚Äôt scare me. Big Pharma doesn‚Äôt scare me. Chip in $2, and I‚Äôll fight my heart out against the big corporate interests as your next president.  
A president‚Äôs first job is to keep America safe. All three of my brothers served in the military, and I understand how much the military sacrifices. We have a responsibility to them. We cannot use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. 
My Secretary of Education will be someone who has taught in public schools.My Secretary of Education will believe in public education. My Secretary of Education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools. 
If we want to build a future in this country, then we do that by investing in our children. I‚Äôve got a plan to invest $800 billion in our public schools.  
Mike Bloomberg has dumped millions of dollars into trying to elect Republicans‚Äîincluding the incumbent Senate Republican I beat. I don't care how much money he has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him‚Äîand that makes him the riskiest candidate.  
While Mayor Bloomberg was blaming the 2008 housing crash on Black and Latino Americans, I was out there fighting to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make sure people aren‚Äôt cheated on their mortgages. 
It's not enough to talk about housing neutrally. We need to talk about race.We must call out the decades of government-sponsored discrimination against Black Americans buying homes and fight back. I have a plan for that.  
My Secretary of Education will believe in public education.My Secretary of Education will believe in public schools.My Secretary of Education will believe that it‚Äôs time to end high-stakes testing. My Secretary of Education will be a former public school teacher. 
The Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas. But getting that agenda enacted is going to be hard.I know how to fight, I know how to build a coalition‚Äîand I know how to win.  
Gun violence is a public health crisis. That‚Äôs why I have a comprehensive plan to end the NRA‚Äôs influence and eliminate corrupt lawmakers‚Äô ability to block our government from defending the lives of our people.  
I asked Mayor Bloomberg to release all the women from non-disclosure agreements‚Äîwhich he refuses to do. His response? "Enough is never enough‚Äù for her. That's right‚Äîand I‚Äôll keep fighting for everyone whose voices need to be heard. 
I‚Äôve seen gun control legislation introduced in the Senate, get a majority vote‚Äîand then fail to pass because of the filibuster. Understand this: Many people on the  stage don‚Äôt support rolling back the filibuster‚ÄîI do. We need to roll it back.
Billionaires don‚Äôt have to worry about fundraising goals. But we do. Will you chip in $2 or whatever you can during the  to make our campaign‚Äôs best month for fundraising even better?
How about a  in America? With a small wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1%, we have a chance to invest in Universal Child Care, put $50 billion into HBCUs, and start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans. 
Bloomberg and his companies have been accused of harassment and discrimination. But the women are bound by nondisclosures so they cannot speak. If he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let the women speak out and tell their stories. 
I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him, and that means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.He hasn‚Äôt earned their trust. I will. 
In 2012, Mayor Bloomberg scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger: me. It didn't work, but he tried hard. 
Who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re-election last time? Mayor Bloomberg. And that's not the only right-wing Senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded. In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect a right-wing senator.

The Democratic party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas‚Äîeven if there are a lot of people on the  stage who don't want to say so.
We‚Äôre moments away from the  and I‚Äôm thinking about the power of our grassroots movement.Together, we raised more than $21 million this month so far‚Äîour campaign‚Äôs best month ever. Will you pitch in $2 before the  begins?

It‚Äôs important to strengthen relationships with democratic partners like India. But we must be able to speak truthfully about our values, including religious freedom and freedom of expression‚Äîand violence against peaceful protestors is never acceptable.

 San Francisco: let‚Äôs get out the vote for on Super Tuesday next week!  
Like so much else, the Trump administration‚Äôs bungled response to the coronavirus outbreak is a mess. As president, I will lead a competent administration prepared to combat outbreaks‚Äîbecause our public health, economy, and national security depend on it.
The outbreak also shows how vulnerable our manufacturing sector and our economy are to disruptions in China. I‚Äôve got a plan to bring more production back home, which will create jobs and reduce our vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. 
We should be taking action right now to mitigate the supply chain impacts of the outbreak. The government should be helping American manufacturers find alternative sources for parts and production and helping American exporters find new purchasers.
The economic threat is also growing‚Äîthe 1800-point drop in the Dow this week is the tip of the iceberg. Without swift action, supply chain disruptions and reduced purchases will have severe, long-term effects on our entire economy.
As the virus spreads, the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs ongoing attempts to hide what‚Äôs happening in China endangers the health of people around the world. Instead of praising Xi, as Trump has done, we should lead a global effort to uphold principles of open science and transparency.
Even worse, Trump refuses to centralize crisis management in the White House‚Äîallowing CDC scientists to be overruled and sowing internal dysfunction. All this mismanagement casts doubt on how effectively he can deploy emergency funding. 
Before requesting much needed emergency funding, Trump pushed again and again for dangerous budget cuts to public health and aid programs‚Äîbut we win the fight against outbreaks by preparing and investing in advance, not scrambling once they‚Äôve spread. 
We must treat coronavirus as the serious health, diplomatic, and economic threat it is. Weeks ago, I released a plan for the health risks: more funding for public health and international aid programs, and centralize response management in the White House. 
The Trump administration is absolutely bungling the response to coronavirus, putting our public health and our economy at risk. This is why we need a real plan and an adult in charge. Here's what I think we should be doing.
We need to shift from trickle-down economics to grassroots-up economics. That means a  so we can invest in families. And we need a president who will stand up to Wall Street to protect consumers. That's how we'll build an economy from the ground up. 
Back when I was a young mom, toasters could actually set your kitchen on fire‚Äîask me how I know! But the Consumer Product Safety Commission stepped in, and now they have safety switches.I had an idea for an agency to protect consumers from being cheated‚Äîand it became the CFPB. 
If we fight side by side, we can beat the Big Banks, Big Oil, and Big Pharma‚Äîand actually make our government work for the people.Chip in $2 before midnight to help make it happen. 
Black history is American history. And that history teaches us that racism has shaped crucial aspects of our economic and political system for generations. But if we fight side by side, we can make real, structural change that will honor that history. 
We need a president who will fight for working families‚Äînot for Big Banks. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in this fight.Will you chip in $2 or whatever you can to join me?

I won‚Äôt talk about climate without talking about climate justice. For decades, our government has permitted polluting factories and toxic waste dumps to be put in Black and Latino communities, over and over and over. Enough.  
Climate change is an existential threat. I not only support a  also have a plan for a  because we've got to be thinking about our oceans as well.  
My plan to build 3.2 million new housing units across this country is fully paid for by asking the wealthiest families to pay their fair share. It‚Äôs housing for working families, for people experiencing homelessness, for veterans, for seniors, and more. 
I opposed Las Vegas‚Äôs harmful law that criminalizes being poor. Homelessness is a problem across our country. And you know it here, Nevada: We've also got a housing crisis in this country. 
Mike Bloomberg can easily release the women who have accused him of sexual harassment and discrimination. I used to teach contract law‚Äîso I made it simple for him.  
We need to make sure that everyone has the full health care coverage they need‚Äîand that includes mental health care.  makes certain that everyone has access to the health care they need. 
The world has changed since 2016.In 2018, Democrats took back Nevada because women ran, and women won. And that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre going to do in 2020. 
If Mitch McConnell tries to do to me what he did to President Obama‚Äîblock whatever our administration is trying to do‚Äîthen I'm all for rolling back the filibuster. And that means we could get immigration reform done on 50 votes. 
Immigration does not make this nation weaker‚Äîimmigration makes this country stronger. We need to expand legal immigration, and that means a pathway to citizenship for all of our neighbors, friends, and loved ones who are here. 
I believe in the rule of law. That means we need a Justice Department with an Attorney General whose loyalty is not to the person who sits in the White House. The loyalty oath they take is to the Constitution of the United States of America. 
I want everyone to hear this who is in the Trump administration right now: If you get out there and break the law now serving this president, he may be willing to look the other way, but President Warren will not look the other way. 
Let's face it. We cannot afford to win in November by a little tiny bit.We must win by so much that no one can deny it. Chip in now to help make it happen. 
It‚Äôs deeply worrisome that we now live in an America where one political party seems to think political interference helps them in an election. We‚Äôll keep pushing Mitch McConnell to tighten security around our elections. 
My  is supported by Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. Why? Because Americans, regardless of party affiliations, understand they're getting the short end of the stick. It‚Äôs time for a little basic fairness. 
Before the financial crisis, I kept warning about how mortgage companies were targeting communities of color. I was out there ringing every alarm bell I could ring. But nobody wanted to hear it. So I got in that fight. That's why I was right here in Nevada. 
All I can do here at tonight‚Äôs  and for as long as I am in this race, as long as I've got breath in my body‚Äîis to fight for working families, and to make this an America that isn't just about all the riches getting sucked up to the top. 
I didn't spend my life thinking I‚Äôd be a president or senator. I spent my life studying what was happening to working families in America. I was a teacher and a researcher. And I kept watching year by year, as life just got tougher and tougher for working people. 
If Mike Bloomberg is not willing to release the women from the NDAs, then he is disqualified from being president of the United States. 
This is an election for president of the United States. Transparency here is important. 
Mike Bloomberg can easily release the women who have accused him of sexual harassment‚Äîand who voluntarily want to speak about their experiences‚Äîfrom their non-disclosure agreements. Take a look at how simple and straightforward it would be:

 THIS MORNING: Fresh off last night‚Äôs  stage, Sen. joins co-hosts LIVE from Las Vegas.

I want to make sure that environmental justice gets more than a passing mention. I have made a commitment to invest a trillion dollars to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to be inflicted on communities of color. We have to own up to our responsibility.  
Of all the people on the  stage, I‚Äôve been a politician the shortest‚Äîbut I've been the one out fighting for families the longest. As President, I'll fight for your family as hard as I fight for mine. 
This is not just a question of Mike Bloomberg‚Äôs character‚Äîit‚Äôs a question about electability. We‚Äôre not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who silences women with who knows how many nondisclosure agreements.  
I just stepped off the  stage and got some good news from my team: We‚Äôre getting closer to our fundraising goal of $7 million before the Nevada caucuses on Saturday.Chip in $2 and I could give you a call tomorrow to say thanks. 
I grew up in Oklahoma. I grew up fighting.I watched when my dad had a heart attack, when our car was lost, when we were on the edge of losing our home. I watched my mother fight to save our family. And I grew up fighting to save our family. 
A majority of Americans‚ÄîDemocrats, independents, and Republicans‚Äîsupport my  on all fortunes above $50 million.  
This is a question of values. Do we want to invest in Mayor Bloomberg, or in an entire generation of young people? 
With my  we can afford:‚úÖ Universal Child Care and universal pre-k‚úÖ Raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher‚úÖ Put $800 billion into our public schools‚úÖ $50 billion into our HBCUs and more
This presidential race is about leadership and accountability. Mike Bloomberg needs a different apology.  
There‚Äôs a startup gap between white entrepreneurs and Latino entrepreneurs. The principal reason is that Latino entrepreneurs don‚Äôt have the equity to get businesses started. I have a plan to put $7 billion in a fund to help people who are routinely cut out. 
The end of redlining didn't cause the 2008 crash. Out-of-control greed by big banks‚Äîand the corruption that lets them control our government‚Äîcaused the crash. We need to confront the shameful legacy of discrimination, not lie about it like Mike Bloomberg has done. 
We can't simply talk about climate change in big, global terms. We have to own up to our responsibility. We need to talk about it in terms of rescuing the communities that have been damaged. 
The question of environmental justice should get more than a glancing blow in this  I have a commitment of a trillion dollars to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to inflict on Black and Brown communities for generations. 
Let‚Äôs be clear: We need to get rid of the filibuster. If you're not willing to roll back the filibuster, then you're giving the fossil fuel industry a veto. 
Why can't we get anything passed in Washington on climate? Corruption. The first thing I want to do as president is pass my anti-corruption bill so we can start making changes and stand up to the fossil fuel industry. 
I believe in science.And I believe that one way we're going to deal with the climate crisis is by increasing by tenfold our investment in science. I have a plan for that.  
On my first day as president, I will sign an executive order to stop all new drilling and mining on public lands and offshore drilling. We cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits. 
While Mike Bloomberg was blaming Blacks and Latinos for the 2008 financial crisis, I was holding hearings with families in Nevada who were losing their homes. I have a record of fighting for working families‚Äîand winning.  
This is not just a question of Mayor Bloomberg‚Äôs character‚Äîit‚Äôs a question about electability. We‚Äôre not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who silences women with who knows how many nondisclosure agreements. That's not what we do as Democrats. 
Mayor Bloomberg has made women‚Äîdozens, who knows‚Äîsign nondisclosure agreements for sexual harassment and gender discrimination.Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story? 
I hope you heard what Mayor Bloomberg‚Äôs defense of decades of mistreatment to women was: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been nice to some women.‚ÄùThat just doesn‚Äôt cut it. 
If you want to issue a real apology, then it has to start with the racist intent of the plan, and the willful ignorance of admitting what was happening even as people protested in your own streets. You need a different apology here, Mr. Mayor. 
This is about leadership and accountability. When Mayor Bloomberg apologizes for stop and frisk, he talks about how it turned out. The problem is what it was designed to do to begin with: Target communities of color and Black and Brown men from the start. 
Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. It's time to have a president who is on the side of working families‚Äîand is willing to get out there and fight for them.  
I met a man in Reno with diabetes who gets his insulin through the VA. His sister and daughter also have diabetes‚Äîand no way to pay for it.Three human beings right here in Nevada‚Äîsharing one insulin prescription.That should not happen in America.  
You can't stand on the  stage and trash  without a realistic plan of your own. And if you're not going to own up to the fact that you don't have a plan‚Äîor that your plan will leave people without full coverage‚Äîthen you need to say so. 
Health care is a crisis in this country. My approach is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible. To bring in as many supporters as we can. If we don't get it all the first time, we take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more. 
Wall Street tried to stop us. I won, they lost. We‚Äôre not going to beat Donald Trump with a candidate who makes excuses for the powerful. We need a candidate who has shown they can fight them‚Äîand win. 
I will never forget one of your neighbors, Mr. Estrada, who broke down in tears over how he did everything right‚Äîbut then Wells Fargo yanked his home away. I spent years fighting to make sure that would never happen again. 
While Mike Bloomberg was blaming Black and Latino families for the 2008 crash, I was in Nevada‚Äîliterally down the street from where we‚Äôre standing tonight‚Äîholding hearings on how Wall Street was ripping homes away from millions of people. 
The way we are going to lead this country and beat Donald Trump is going to be with a candidate who has rock-solid values and who actually gets something done. 
This country has worked for the rich and left everyone else in the dirt for too long. It‚Äôs time to have a president who is willing to get out there and fight for working families. That‚Äôs why I am in this race. And that‚Äôs how I will beat Donald Trump. 
Democrats won‚Äôt win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, harassing women, and supporting racist policies like stop and frisk and redlining. Understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. 
I'd like to talk about who we're running against: A billionaire who calls women ‚Äúfat broads‚Äù and ‚Äúhorsey-faced lesbians.‚Äù And no I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg. 
I‚Äôm deeply grateful to everyone who pitches in what they can to our campaign. Together, we can put power in the hands of working people and make our government work for all of us. Join us:  
Brandon, I‚Äôm in this fight for you, Drew, and Juan. We will build a better America, together.

On this Day of Remembrance, we must acknowledge when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order to unjustly incarcerate 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. It comes upon us to call out our government‚Äôs legacy of racism and injustice‚Äîand keep fighting against it.
We can defeat the climate crisis, create 10.6 million good union jobs, and end environmental racism so working families can live with clean air and water. This is how we‚Äôll build a country that works for everyone‚Äînot just giant polluters and fossil fuel companies. 
Unions and workers have been by my side since I first ran for the Senate, and I will be fighting alongside them in the White House. 
We need to build an immigration system that is fair, humane, and reflects our best values. We need  and to ensure immigrants receive due process. It's time for

A lot of politicians praise entrepreneurs and mom-and-pop shops, but they support the big businesses that can hire armies of lobbyists. And being pro big-business means, by and large, being pro-big businesses run by white men. It's time to change that. 
Small businesses are the heart of our economy, but it's getting harder to start and grow one‚Äîand the challenges are even greater for communities of color. I've got a comprehensive plan to boost America's small businesses.

Mike Bloomberg's expansion of ‚Äústop and frisk‚Äù devastated Black and Brown communities. For years, he used racist justifications to defend the practice‚Äîand more comments are already resurfacing. We need a nominee that Democratic voters can trust. 
This grassroots movement isn't just about defeating Donald Trump. Big, structural change means winning up and down the ticket. That's why I'm proudly endorsing candidates fighting to put power in the hands of the people. 
These are frightening times. People are afraid for their friends, their family, their neighbors. Yet they still have so much optimism that we can defeat Donald Trump and build a better country. They give me hope and fuel this fight. Thank you so much, Reno!

This is a totally unnecessary escalation that is only intended to intimidate our cities and increase fear in immigrant communities. We must end the cruel, inhumane policies of the Trump administration. 
Enough is enough. We have to end the opioid epidemic and ensure that everyone gets the treatment they need. And we must root out the greed and corruption that has fueled this crisis. 
Lizzy from Massachusetts chipped in a few bucks to our campaign‚Äîso I called to say thanks. I told Lizzy and her daughter, Annie, that I‚Äôm fighting for them. The only way we‚Äôll make real change is by doing it together. Chip in now and I could call you next!

Thank you for welcoming me to Virginia, 
It was so good to see you and your family last night, Thanks for being a part of this grassroots movement. 
The energy last night in Virginia was incredible‚Äîand this grassroots movement is only growing stronger. Help us keep building this momentum. Chip in to help meet our ambitious $7 million goal before the Nevada caucuses, and I might call you to say thanks!

We will not allow Donald Trump to drag us into another endless war. I'm proud to stand with on this important resolution. 
Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day, I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better gift than having you on this team.

Refusing to catalogue paid political ads because the Bloomberg campaign found a workaround means there will be less transparency for the content he is paying to promote. Mike Bloomberg cannot be allowed to buy an election with zero accountability. 
 said that democracy doesn't die in darkness‚Äîit dies on television with nobody acting on it.But it doesn't have to be that way. We can't just sit by and watch this happen. We have to act against the Trump administration's corruption. 
 This is leadership. This is how you fix broken systems. Join me in supporting

This week, we announced an ambitious new goal: $7 million before the Nevada caucuses. I believe this movement can do it‚Äîand I'll be calling grassroots donors to say thanks!Chip in $5 or whatever you can now, and you might just get a call from me today.
The 2008 financial crash would not have been averted if we had allowed the banks to be more racist. And anyone who thinks otherwise should not be the leader of our party. 
I‚Äôm deeply grateful for your endorsement, I don‚Äôt take it lightly‚Äîand I ask you to hold me accountable as we partner in this fight for big, structural change. 
Yesterday, we announced our most ambitious fundraising goal yet: $7 million before the Nevada caucuses.If you can help and chip in tonight, we‚Äôll be well on our way. Will you pitch in $3 now? 
Those who testified today are incredibly brave. Fast food workers need and deserve the job security to be able to speak up about sexual harassment or an abusive boss, organize with co-workers, or ask for a raise or a schedule change. We need to protect and empower their voices. 
I‚Äôm ready to fight for you, Virginia! Let‚Äôs do this. 
I believe that you measure what you care about‚Äîand I care about building a government that works for everyone in the diverse AAPI community. 
Tuesday was AAPI Women's Equal Pay Day. AAPI women as a whole are paid 90 cents on every dollar earned by white men. But Native Hawaiian women make 63 cents, Samoan women make 62 cents, and Fijian women make just 55 cents on the dollar. 
Here's just one example: Income inequality in Asian American communities nearly doubled from 1970 to 2016. Burmese, Nepalese, Hmong, and Bangladeshi Americans make, on average, less than half what people in some other AAPI communities make.
The AAPI community includes nearly 50 diverse racial and ethnic groups, but the data we gather today doesn‚Äôt capture significant differences on key economic and social outcomes. Data equity is a civil rights issue‚Äîand I've got a plan for that. 
 ‚ÄúWhen I was growing up, I heard claims that all Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders fit the 'model minority' mold --‚Ä¶
We need to confront the racist legacy of redlining head-on. My housing plan creates a first-of-its-kind down-payment assistance program to help families living in formerly redlined neighborhoods buy a home.  
 I‚Äôm supporting my good friend  for MANY reasons. Her unwavering effective support of Indian Country is one of‚Ä¶
The Trump administration is refusing to allow grieving parents to visit their remaining daughter. The Muslim Ban is cruel, and it's time for it to go. Congress must pass the No Ban Act. 
 I will provide a path to citizenship for the 1.7 million undocumented  expand family reunification, and roll back harmful policies like Trump‚Äôs Public Charge rule, which prevents children from having access to critical services.  
 I‚Äôll use every tool to fight hate crimes. I'll rebuild trust with targeted communities by working with community leaders and directing the CDC to research white nationalism. And my DOJ will prioritize combatting white nationalist violence.  
 From rising seas to lingering effects of nuclear testing, Pacific Islanders face dangers of climate change firsthand. As president, I'll remediate historic injustices for frontline communities by prioritizing at least $1 trillion in climate investments. 
 AAPI Americans‚Äô voices will be crucial in 2020. My plan would guarantee the fundamental right to vote, ensure racist and corrupt politicians don‚Äôt undermine that right, and improve voting accessibility for LEP voters.  
 The student loan crisis is crushing a generation. Enough is enough: Starting on day one of my presidency, I‚Äôll cancel student debt for 95% of Americans who have it. Then, we‚Äôll make public colleges, which over 80% of AAPI students attend, free‚Äîno tuition or fees. 
 My goal as president, and our goal as a society, will be to reduce gun deaths by 80%‚Äîand I have a plan to get it done.  
 We have a gun violence epidemic in this country. We need to act‚Äînow. I will break the NRA‚Äôs stranglehold on Congress and sign comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation into law in my first 100 days, and keep improving on it every year. 
 We need expanded legal immigration that will grow our economy and reunite families. We need to provide due process to migrants. I‚Äôll eliminate the use of expedited removal proceedings and fight for a national immigration public defender corps. 
 Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. We need to build a fair, humane immigration system that reflects our values‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan for that. 
 I will strengthen protections for English Language Learners in schools, make elections more accessible to Limited English Proficiency voters, and reverse Trump's shameful proposal to roll back health care non-discrimination protections for LEP people under Section 1557. 
 I‚Äôll form a White House Task Force on data equity to make sure that no one in the AAPI community is erased. We‚Äôll work with AAPI communities to collect comprehensive, disaggregated data in key federal surveys and across agencies.  
 Data equity is a civil rights issue. AAPI people are not a monolith, and aggregated data hides the fact that many AAPI families are hanging on by their fingernails. Data erasure limits our abilities to tackle the structural barriers faced by distinct AAPI communities. 
 I will build a cabinet and senior leadership team that reflects the full diversity of America‚Äôs communities. I will diversify recruitment for government jobs, including directing resources toward attracting applicants from minority-serving institutions. 
 We need to staff our government with people who deeply understand the intersectional needs and experiences of all Americans‚Äîfrom housing to health care‚Äîand who reflect the diversity of the American people, and that includes Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. 
 Personnel is policy. I‚Äôm proud to have the first Asian American campaign manager of any major presidential campaign. I‚Äôve pledged to appoint a diverse cabinet. I‚Äôll listen to and learn from AAPI leaders who have been at the forefront of advocating for their communities. 
Learn more about my platform at the  Twitter Town Hall, happening soon at 2 PM ET‚Äîand join the conversation using the hashtag 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing minority group in the U.S. today‚Äîworking hard to thrive, but still facing unique barriers to achieving their dreams. I'm a fighter for working families‚Äîand committed to fighting for AAPI families. 
Here‚Äôs a history lesson on the racist legacy of redlining, if any presidential candidate needs a refresher. 
If we want to build a government and a country that works for everyone, we need to tackle generations of racial injustice and systemic discrimination head on. I‚Äôll listen to and learn from the AAPI leaders who have been at the forefront of this fight. 
We need to take concrete steps to address the impact of redlining and the subprime mortgage crisis. I built an office at the to fight lending discrimination and my housing plan helps families in formerly redlined areas to buy homes and build wealth. 
The end of redlining didn't cause the 2008 crash. Out-of-control greed by Wall Street and big banks, and the corruption that lets them control our government, caused the crash. Predatory lenders steered families of color into the worst loans and those families lost billions.
I'm surprised that someone running for the Democratic nomination thinks the economy would be better off if we just let banks be more overtly racist. We need to confront the shameful legacy of discrimination, not lie about it like Mike Bloomberg has done. 
 Thank you, Smitha! I‚Äôm thankful to have your support!
 I deeply appreciate your support, Erika!

David Adame-Reyes was arrested for sitting on a sidewalk, then sent to immigration detention. This is cruel and unjust. Immigration and law enforcement should be kept separate‚Äîcombining them only sows distrust and harms public safety.

No one should attack and its members for fighting hard for themselves and their families. Like them, I want to see every American get high-quality and affordable health care‚Äîand I‚Äôm committed to working with them to achieve that goal. 
I'll be on shortly to talk about how we're building our grassroots movement to power through Nevada, South Carolina, Super Tuesday, and beyond. Tune in!
A third of delegates aren't decided until Super Tuesday. What we do now matters.Our campaign needs critical funds to reach voters and caucus-goers, so we‚Äôve set an ambitious goal: $7 million before the Nevada caucuses.Will you chip in $5 or more now?  
From day one, this fight has been the same. Our government and our economy are working better and better for a thinner slice at the top‚Äîat the expense of everyone else. We need big, structural change to make them work for everyone. 
Gutting funding for clean energy isn't just bad for our climate‚Äîit kills jobs. If we want to fight climate change and create good union jobs, we need to invest in clean energy. 
 Zaya is a remarkable young woman with such an insight on life. Bruce, I, and our entire team are inspired by her. We‚Äôre sending all our love and support. Thank you for being such incredible parents‚ÄîI know that‚Äôs the future you want for all our kids.
We will win by uniting our country around ending the corruption that has shortchanged our kids, our schools, and the very survival of our planet. 
This fight to save our democracy is an uphill battle. But our campaign is built for the long haul, and we are just getting started. We have the hope that comes with dreaming big‚Äîand the courage to fight for the big, structural change we need. 
Americans of all political stripes should be gravely concerned about the corruption that pressures federal prosecutors to give sweetheart deals to criminals who do their crimes on behalf of Donald Trump.Yes Roger Stone, I‚Äôm looking at you. 
Thank you, I know that we will continue fighting together for Massachusetts families, and for working families all across our country.
Abusing official power to protect political friends and attack opponents is common in authoritarian regimes like Putin‚Äôs Russia. Trump and Barr‚Äôs conduct has no place in our democracy. To end it, Congress must act‚Äîand the American people must hold them accountable in November.
I am the only candidate to propose an independent DOJ task force to investigate crimes by Trump administration officials. Every Democratic candidate must commit to it‚Äîso Trump officials know they will be held accountable by career prosecutors once he is out of office.
Congress must act immediately to rein in our lawless Attorney General. Barr should resign or face impeachment. And Congress should use spending power to defund the AG‚Äôs authority to interfere with anything that affects Trump, his friends, or his elections.
Donald Trump can continue his corrupt rampages and vendettas because elected Republicans do nothing. They lack the courage and backbone shown by four career prosecutors who stepped down rather than facilitate the Attorney General‚Äôs corrupt scheme. But we are not powerless.
Donald Trump is shredding the rule of law in this country. His AG overruled career prosecutors to reduce the sentence for his buddy Roger Stone after Stone committed crimes to protect him. Every Republican who voted to acquit Trump for his corrupt actions enabled and owns this.
We‚Äôre staying in this fight for the people who are counting on us. Tomorrow morning, we‚Äôll wake up and fight twice as hard‚Äîtogether. Chip in $5 and let‚Äôs do this:

This fight to save our democracy is an uphill battle. But our campaign is built for the long haul, and we are just getting started. Because if we have the hope that comes with dreaming big‚Äîif we have the courage to fight hard‚Äîwe are going to win!

People are worried that the fight against Trump is unwinnable. Well, I‚Äôve got a record of winning fights they said were unwinnable‚Äîfrom the CFPB to unseating a popular Republican senator.Everyone thinks they know what fights are unwinnable‚Äîuntil we fight, persist, and win.
States are trying to ban safe, legal abortion outright, and the Supreme Court seems to be headed in that direction as well. If we are going to protect our rights, we cannot rely on the courts. We need federal laws to protect the right to an abortion.  
The vast majority agree on policy solutions to help end gun violence right now. But nothing gets done because the gun industry is holding our Congress hostage. We need to root out corruption in Washington.  
 Fact: Right now, we've got the most donations processing simultaneously EVER for our campaign. Add yours here! üëá 
Put real money into our schools.Put real money into housing.Put real money into health care.Put real money into the future of our children.That's how we build the America of our best values. 
I believe that the best investment we can make as a nation, the best investment we can make as human beings, is to invest in our children. I have a plan for that. 
We cannot only talk about how important the Black community is at election time. We need to have concrete plans that will have a real impact on Black Americans‚Äô lives. I'm in this fight to make real change.  
I just stepped off the  stage and got some good news from my team: We‚Äôre getting close to hitting our $2 million fundraising goal before the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday!Will you chip in $3 tonight? I wouldn‚Äôt ask if it wasn‚Äôt important. 
With my  we can get  universal pre-k for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America, and raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in America, who are largely Black and Brown women. 
The new trade deal makes things somewhat better for American farmers and workers. And when I see change that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people, I'll sign up for that‚Äîand I'll get up tomorrow and start working for a better trade deal on climate. 
We build a movement by funding it from the grassroots up. That's the way I'm running my campaign. I don‚Äôt take money from federal lobbyists or billionaires at fancy fundraisers. If you think it's the right way to run‚Äîchip in $3 before the  ends. 
I hear everyone talking about how we all want to overturn Citizens United because we want to end unlimited spending. Everyone on this stage except Amy and me is a billionaire or receiving help from Super PACs. Time to put your money where your mouth is. 
No one should be able to buy their way into being president of the United States. And no one who sucks up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns should be able to do it either. 
We cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race. We need race-conscious laws.  
It's time to end endless wars and bring our troops home.  
For generations, government redlining prevented people of color from buying homes. You can't just repeal that and think everything is fine. We need race-conscious laws in education, in employment, and entrepreneurship to make this a country of opportunity for everyone. 
We must rework our justice system from what we criminalize at the front end, to how we help people come back to their communities.But we can't say criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically. We must start having race-conscious laws. 
States are heading toward trying to ban safe, legal abortion and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well. We need a national law to protect a person‚Äôs right to control their own body. 
Until we roll back the filibuster, the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we'll never make the changes. We have to be willing to build a future that works not for a gun industry‚Äîbut works for the rest of America and protects our children. 
Why can we not even get a vote in the United States Senate on background checks? Because the gun industry continues to call the shots. 
We have a gun violence problem in America, and it‚Äôs often communities of color that are hit hardest. We need to treat it like the public health emergency that it is. 
People across the country see that our government is working great for billionaires and giant corporations, while they and their children are left with less. We have to stand up to those who control our government and make that government work for us.  
I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I‚Äôve been to Afghanistan. We cannot wait five more years or ten more years, or until we turn the corner ten more times. We need to bring our combat troops home. 
We are Democrats. We are on the side of everyone in America who needs health care. And when we come up against Donald Trump‚Äîthe man trying to take health care from millions of people‚Äîthat is what will matter.  
Americans are losing faith in our government. They see themselves and their children with less and less. It‚Äôs not enough to simply talk about the future. We must stand up to those who now control our government, and make our government work for the people instead. 
We need to re-establish the rule of law in our country. I believe in an independent commission in our Justice Department that investigates crimes committed by our own government.No one is above the law‚Äîand that includes the president of the United States. 
On day one, I‚Äôll do what a president can do all by herself: Defend the Affordable Care Act and reduce the costs of prescription drugs like insulin, HIV AIDS drugs, and EpiPens. We are Democrats‚Äîwe are on the side of those who need health care. 
In 2018, 36 million Americans couldn't afford to have a prescription filled. We need to bring the most help to the most people as quickly as possible. We need  
Democrats, Independents, and Republicans across the country understand that our government works great for the rich and powerful and no one else. Fighting corruption head on is what‚Äôs going to bring Americans together‚Äîand it‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to win in November. 
Donald Trump hired Gordon Sondland to be his ambassador to the EU after he donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee. Now he's fired Sondland after he testified about Trump's crimes. The corruption of this administration knows no bounds.  
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is a decorated servicemember. He did his patriotic, constitutional duty. And now Donald Trump has retaliated against him. 
It was so great to meet Vivian and Riley, two graduate students from Dartmouth, before tonight's  They won the contest after chipping in to help power this grassroots movement. I‚Äôm so grateful to have them in this fight! 
Donald Trump spent his career getting rich off the backs of others. Today, he's exploiting our government for his own personal benefit.I grew up in Oklahoma on the ragged edge of the middle class. I'm fighting to make our government work for all families.
  remember.   
Sandra Bland should still be alive today to celebrate her 33rd birthday. We must  we must honor her life by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.My heart goes out to Sandra Bland's friends, family, and everyone who is missing her today. 
If we‚Äôre going to be a country where the only way you get to be president is by starting out as a billionaire‚Äîor by spending most of your time sucking up to billionaires and giant corporations‚Äîthen this will be a country that only works for billionaires and giant corporations. 
Mitch McConnell couldn't silence Coretta Scott King's voice three years ago, and we won't let her enduring warning be forgotten. We must keep uplifting the voices of Black women fighting voter suppression today, and partner with them in this fight. 
Donald Trump is exploiting our government to line his own pockets. This is corruption, plain and simple. 
Corruption follows corruption. It's time to end the practice of auctioning off cushy diplomatic posts to the highest bidder‚Äîand rebuild our State Department with committed, competent professionals. 
We face big challenges right now. But Americans have always met big problems with even bigger solutions. That‚Äôs who we are.I'm optimistic because here in Derry, New Hampshire, and all across America, I see the grassroots movement that is ready to fight back.

I'll have a Secretary of Education who's been a public school teacher, who believes in public education, and who believes that public dollars should stay in public schools. Our Department of Education should be on the side of students, not for-profit institutions.  
There's a lot we can do to end gun violence‚Äîand I've got a plan outlining how I'll do that. But we should also ask why nothing is being done right now. If we want to end gun violence, we must root out the corruption that is holding up progress.

Since Donald Trump was elected, women have been outperforming men in competitive elections. Democrats took back the House and state houses across the country because of women candidates. It's simple: Women win!  
I've got three older brothers‚Äîtwo of them are Republicans. But there's a lot we agree on, like corruption. We all agree that it's not right when the wealthy and well-connected use their influence in Washington to rewrite the rules in their favor.  
They said the CFPB would never happen. They said I couldn't beat a popular Republican incumbent. They said a woman couldn't win. Every time, I proved them wrong. I know how to fight, and I know how to win. Will you chip in $3 to help power our movement? 
I'll be joining on shortly to talk about the grassroots movement we're building to defeat Donald Trump. I hope you'll tune in!
The people who whisper in my ear, who tell me about their lives, who put a note in my hand, who tell me what universal health care would mean for them: My selfie lines are about listening to concerns and dreams of Americans who need a government on their side.

The way we keep America safe and reduce tension with Iran is to work with our allies, build out our State Department, get Iran back to the negotiating table, and back away from the edge of war. 
I‚Äôm not cozying up to billionaires behind closed doors or calling up wealthy donors for big checks. Instead, I'm running a 100% grassroots-funded campaign. If you think this is how campaigns should be run, chip in now and join this grassroots movement:  
We need to treat gun violence like a public health emergency. That means we collect data about where the threats come from, and then reduce those threats. We have to be a nation committed to reducing gun violence. As president, I will reduce gun violence by 80% over eight years.
Why have we done nothing on gun violence when more than 90% of Americans want us to pass background checks? The reason is corruption. It‚Äôs the power of the gun industry and the power of the NRA. We need to attack that corruption head on. 
We cannot be a nation that takes away children from their families, or that takes people who come to us who are desperate and treat them with anything other than humanity. We have a moral responsibility to them and to each other to live our values every day. 
This so-called crisis at our border is one that Donald Trump helped blow up. He did it in part by disrupting aid for Central American countries. We need to restore that aid and help stabilize those governments so people don‚Äôt feel they need to flee for their lives.
Immigration does not make this country weaker. Immigration makes this country stronger. 
I grew up in Oklahoma on the ragged edge of the middle class. Donald Trump grew up rich in a New York City mansion, and spent his life getting richer off the backs of others. We see our government differently‚Äîhe wants to exploit it, I want to make sure it works for everyone. 
193 people die every day from addiction and overdose. We need to tackle opioids like the AIDS crisis: Combat the stigma and put in the real resources to save our neighbors. We need to put the resources in the local communities who are on the frontlines of the crisis.
We have an America where the GDP keeps going up, so does the stock market and corporate profits‚Äîbut hardworking families have virtually flat wages and rising costs for health care, housing, and child care. We‚Äôve got to change that‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in this fight. 
Corruption drives my family crazy. And I think it drives people across this country crazy‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre Democrats, Republicans, Independents. Because they understand that it‚Äôs not right for people to use their power to get the rules re-written in their favor. 
My brothers look at things and say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not right.‚Äù The question is how do those guys get off the hook. The answer? Corruption. If we make that case in 2020, and fight against the most corrupt president in history, that‚Äôs how we win. 
I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have 3 older brothers‚Äî1 is a Democrat, the other 2 are Republicans. I ask my brothers about Eli Lilly and Amazon. You know what they have in common? They made billions of dollars in profits, but paid $0 in federal income taxes. 
I made the decision at the beginning of this campaign that I wasn‚Äôt going to spend my time in closed-door fundraisers or selling my time to billionaires and federal lobbyists. Instead, we're powered by more than 1,000,000 grassroots donors. Chip in at 
My first job was as a special education teacher. That‚Äôs where I learned the worth of every human being. That‚Äôs where I came to understand that public service and teaching are about being there for others. Donald Trump thinks others are there for him.

We can defeat Donald Trump and root out corruption in Washington. We can defeat his hate and bigotry, and build a country of our best values. We can make sure our country works for everyone, not just his wealthy, well-connected cronies. And we can only do it together.
These are hard times. People are frustrated and angry‚Äîbut we must not be discouraged. Now more than ever, we must choose courage and hope over fear. Now is our moment to fight back. We have defeated corruption before, and we will do it again.
Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our election. He undermined our diplomatic relationships and put our national security at risk. He exploits our government for his personal gain‚Äîand Republicans just voted to protect him.
The New STA treaty will expire exactly one year from today, further increasing the risk of nuclear war. Donald Trump can agree to extend this critical treaty today‚Äîbut if he does not get the job done, I will move to extend the agreement on my first day in office.

Ultimately, what you do‚Äîcoming to town halls, knocking on doors, calling voters‚Äîis an act of optimism. It's an act that says: If we get out there and fight from the heart, we'll save our democracy and our country. I believe in that optimism. That's why I'm in this fight.

Last night, I thought about the grassroots movement we've built‚Äîover 1 million grassroots donors, 3 million contributions, and over 100,000 selfies. They see a government that's working great for a thinner slice of the top, and they're ready to fight to make it work for everyone. 
I know many people are starting to feel discouraged. But we are at our best when we take on big battles and fight for our country and our families. If you‚Äôre worried or frustrated‚Äîand want to do something‚Äîjoin our campaign. Let‚Äôs fight back together.  
Now is our moment to choose the future we can build together. Now is our moment to get out there and fight from the heart. Because that is how we will save our democracy and save our country. 
But the character of our country‚Äîand the state of our union‚Äîaren‚Äôt determined by Trump. They‚Äôre determined by our people, and we‚Äôre stronger than Donald Trump. Now more than ever, we must choose courage and hope over fear. 
These are hard times for our country. Tomorrow it looks like Republicans will continue to protect an out-of-control president rather than uphold the Constitution. 
Donald Trump was impeached for pressuring a foreign government to interfere in our election. That's why I'm not at his  tonight‚ÄîI'm with voters in New Hampshire, talking about how we're going to make our government work for them.

Rosa Parks dedicated her life to organizing and advocating for civil rights and racial justice. Her work changed this country and proved the power of protest and grassroots organizing.

Tonight, Donald Trump will make a speech about the state of the union.But I have a message for every American: Our union is stronger than Donald Trump. And in less than a year, our union will be stronger than ever when that one man is replaced by one very persistent woman.

I‚Äôm proud to have top rating. I promise to keep fighting for racial justice and to close the racial wealth gap‚Äîand I'm committed to keep listening, learning, and being held accountable to my promise. 
My friend is kicking off her tour of HBCUs today! For decades, Black Americans were cut out of higher education because of government-sponsored discrimination. As president, I‚Äôll continue to call this out‚Äîand invest at least $50 billion in our HBCUs. 
This is the moment to choose courage over fear. If we get out and we fight hard enough, if we fight for the right reasons, and if we fight from the heart, we will save our democracy and save our country. I believe in that optimism, and that's why I'm in this fight. 
Yesterday we competed, but today we owe it to everyone who caucused in Iowa, and everyone who supports any of the candidates, to show that their voices and hard work count. Our party and our country need more people engaged in the critical mission of defeating Donald Trump. 
People told me the CFPB could never happen‚Äîbut it did. People told me I could never beat a popular Republican incumbent‚Äînow he's a former senator. I know how to fight, and I know how to win. Will you chip in $3 to help keep powering our movement? 
No matter what lies ahead, we are not afraid. This is our moment. Our moment to make history. Our moment to dream big, fight hard, and win. 
In every day and every way, this movement is made up of people who know that the only way to make progress and build power is to fight from the heart. 
Americans do big things. That‚Äôs who we are. We don‚Äôt settle. We don‚Äôt back down. We meet big problems with even bigger solutions. I‚Äôm here tonight because I believe that big dreams are still possible in America. 
On Tuesday, Donald Trump will make a speech about the state of the union.But I have a message for every American: Our union is stronger than Donald Trump. And tonight, as a party, we are one step closer to defeating the most corrupt president in American history.

In Iowa and across the country, one thing stands true about this movement we're building together: Over the past year, you've made me a better candidate‚Äîand you'll make me a better president. 
This  I want to reiterate a promise: When I am president, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons will live in every part of my presidency. And I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day.

In this moment of crisis, I know we'll protect our democracy by standing up for ourselves and each other. We have defeated corruption before. We have changed our system together before. And we will do it again.
The only force that‚Äôs powerful enough to stop Trump and the Republicans is us‚Äîthe American people. They want us to be discouraged and feel hopeless because they're afraid of what will happen when we all come together and take up each other‚Äôs fights.
Senate Republicans have let the American people down, giving Donald Trump permission to conspire with foreign governments to undermine your vote. The GOP has shown where they stand‚Äîand it's not with you.

Senate Republicans and the White House should know that the evidence against Trump won't be hidden forever. On day one as president, I will order the release of every document related to this impeachment inquiry that they've been hiding. The people will learn the truth.
By pushing through a sham trial with no witnesses and no White House documents, they are assisting with his cover-up, and giving him a green light to continue breaking the law. And they've trampled over our Constitution in the process.
Donald Trump is dangerous and corrupt: He undermined our diplomatic relationships for his personal, political gain. He solicited foreign interference in our elections. Even Republicans have begun to admit it‚Äîthey simply refuse to hold him accountable for it.
Donald Trump has deprioritized global health security and cut critical programs like Predict‚Äîwhich can leave us vulnerable to epidemics. As president, I'll bring back Predict and invest in our public health systems to keep us safe from outbreaks like coronavirus.

The Iowa caucuses are just three days away‚Äîso we got some friends together to talk about what you can do these next few days to help! 
Republicans know that the facts are damning for Donald Trump. If they push through a sham trial to protect him, with no witnesses and no White House documents, they will be assisting with his cover-up, and setting a terrible precedent for the future of our country.
I couldn't do this without incredible people like by my side! 
This is shameful. Taxpayer money should be used for programs meant to help American families‚Äînot for the personal benefit of Donald Trump‚Äôs corrupt administration.
And Trump‚Äôs first HHS Secretary still hasn‚Äôt repaid taxpayers for the private jets he took while fighting to rip health care from millions by repealing the ACA.
The head of Medicaid, Seema Verma, spent millions of taxpayer dollars on consultants to boost her personal image while trying to kick people off Medicaid or significantly cut their coverage.

The stakes of this election are too high. We need to fight the spread of false information that disempowers voters and undermines democracy. I‚Äôll do my part‚Äîand I‚Äôm calling on my fellow candidates and big tech companies to do their part, too.
Campaigns and tech companies can take a number of steps to slow the spread of misinformation right now. And as president, I'll take a series of actions to further address the spread of disinformation.
I'm also calling on tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google to take real steps right now to fight disinformation spread on their platforms. The safety of our democracy is more important than shareholder dividends and CEO salaries.
I‚Äôm sending a clear message to anyone associated with the Warren campaign: I will not tolerate the use of false information or false accounts to attack my opponents, promote my campaign, or undermine our elections. And I urge my fellow candidates to do the same.
So today, I‚Äôm making a pledge: I will not knowingly use or spread disinformation to benefit my own candidacy or damage others. And I will fight disinformation aimed at my campaign, my opponents, and voters.
Anyone who seeks to challenge and defeat Donald Trump must be prepared to take on the full array of disinformation that foreign actors and people in and around his campaign will use to divide Democrats, suppress Democratic votes, and erode the standing of the Democratic nominee.
In the 2016 election we saw how digital disinformation was used to influence and suppress voters. But 4 years later, we're hardly better prepared for it. Donald Trump has welcomed foreign interference in our elections, and if he isn't removed from office, he'll continue to do so.
Disinformation and online foreign interference erode our democracy, and Donald Trump has invited both. Anyone who seeks to challenge and defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 election must be fully prepared to take this on‚Äîand I've got a plan to do it.

Donald Trump not only ordered his team to ‚Äúget rid‚Äù of a career ambassador, but did so at a private dinner with wealthy donors. For too long, money has bought access. It‚Äôs time to get money out of politics, pursue real campaign finance reform, and end corruption in Washington.

When we prepare and collaborate to fight common threats, we can stop these diseases in their tracks.
Diseases like coronavirus remind us why we need robust institutions and investments in public health, and a government that is ready to respond at any moment. That means using science-based policy and confronting climate change, which will affect how diseases emerge and spread.
It's time to invest in keeping Americans safe and healthy. That‚Äôs why I have a plan to prevent and prepare for outbreaks, contain them if they do break out, and push for medical advances to treat emerging infectious diseases.

To effectively beat infectious diseases like coronavirus, we need all hands on deck. But like so much else, Trump‚Äôs approach to keeping us safe from disease outbreaks is a mess. When he's gone, we must fix the damage he's done‚Äîand I've got a plan for that.

Even more disturbing, damning evidence that Donald Trump undermined our diplomatic relationships, our committed public servants, and our national security for his own personal, political gain. This is exactly why we need a real trial, with witnesses and documents. 
My fight for social, racial, and economic justice is rooted in my faith. Faith doesn't just call on us to think good thoughts‚Äîit calls on us to act. Today, I'm proud to introduce my Interfaith Advisory Council‚Äîprincipled faith leaders who know our fight is a righteous struggle. 
Yesterday, our grassroots campaign surpassed three million grassroots donations. I‚Äôm deeply grateful for your support: This is what your contributions are building. 
Three million double-woohoo thank yous, Team Warren! You make our campaign possible. 
I believe in the rule of law. The United States must be a country where the rule of law means something. If we don't re-establish the rule of law in this country, every future administration will think they can act illegally without facing any consequences.
The White House and the Republicans have made clear that they don't want the American people to know what happened. So they're not letting any of the documents out and they aren‚Äôt allowing any witnesses. But they should know this evidence won‚Äôt be hidden forever.
On day one as president, I will order the release of every document related to this impeachment inquiry that the administration has been hiding. The public needs to know what happened. All the other candidates for president should commit to take this step as well.
I'll be on soon to talk about the impeachment trial and how we'll hold Donald Trump accountable.
Thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, while unused aid remained in a warehouse under the government's watch. That's corruption‚Äîplain and simple. I stand with the people of Puerto Rico as they demand accountability from their government.
Impeachment managers laid out a clear case describing how Donald Trump solicited a bribe from President Zelensky when he pressured him to open investigations into a political opponent. If any other official did that, they would be in jail. This is a criminal presidency.
 Ë∞¢Ë∞¢, We are grateful for the support from these amazing leaders and proud to be a part of this with all of you!‚Ä¶
Trump has sought foreign interference at least twice to help him in elections. He‚Äôs a repeat offender‚Äîand if Senate Republicans protect him now, they are giving him a green light to do it again.
John Stumpf oversaw a scam that hurt hundreds of thousands of customers and cost workers their jobs. It's not accountability for him to give back a fraction of the millions he made. As I've said, he should be criminally investigated‚Äîand put in jail if the facts justify it.

The conditions in Parchman are dangerous and inhumane, and we are seeing the deadly consequences. As we fight to end mass incarceration, our government needs to meet basic human rights standards for the people under its care.  
Construction workers building our cities deserve justice and fair wages. As a former law professor, I stand with members fighting for justice and dignity as they call on to ensure workers are paid what they‚Äôre owed.

When a public school teacher from Des Moines, Iowa asked me about the greatest threat facing our nation, I said climate change. We've got to fight this climate crisis, because that is how we will keep America safe. 
Donald Trump has done serious damage to our government. As president, I‚Äôll move swiftly to appoint new personnel who will undo his disastrous policies‚Äîand I'll adopt the strictest anti-corruption hiring rules of any administration in American history. 
The president of the United States has abused our government for his own personal, political gain. It's corruption, plain and simple.We have a moment now to root out corruption and make sure government works for everyone‚Äînot just Donald Trump and his rich cronies. 
I'll be on shortly to discuss the impeachment trial and how I'm fighting to root out corruption in Washington.
Planned Parenthood fights every day to ensure people get the reproductive health care they need. That‚Äôs why I was proud to join in Iowa for a fireside chat, and why I stand with them to protect the important health services they provide. 
I lived in an America where abortions were illegal. If you had the means, you still had access to safe abortions. It was the most marginalized and vulnerable people who did not. We can never go back to that time.  
Thank you for your leadership. I'm proud to take this pledge. We've got to make sure our government and our economy work for our family farmers, farmworkers, and food chain workers‚Äînot just Big Ag and giant corporations.

We need to make sure our government and our economy work for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. There are nearly 140 million poor and low-income people living in this country‚Äîalmost half of our population. This is the central question of our election.

Black and Brown women are leading the charge to protect reproductive rights‚Äîyet they face significant barriers accessing abortion care. My administration will empower their leadership and fight against the decades of systematic racism that has led to this point.  
If Michael Bloomberg wants to be the Democratic nominee, he should let reporters do their jobs and report on him, and everyone else, as they see fit. And he should divest from Bloomberg News so there‚Äôs no question about his influence over news coverage of presidential candidates.
I‚Äôve taken more than a thousand unfiltered questions from the press and from voters since I got in the race. I welcome tough questions and scrutiny because the free press is a cornerstone of our democracy‚Äîand every presidential candidate should be closely vetted.
Bloomberg News banned its reporters from investigating Democratic candidates as Mike Bloomberg runs for president. This ban puts reporters in an impossible situation and undermines a free press. Bloomberg should lift the ban and divest from Bloomberg News. 
 Incarcerated women in Florida demand dignity, especially during pregnancy. We will continue to fight for prison reform,‚Ä¶

Mitch McConnell knows the facts are damning for Donald Trump. To protect him, he‚Äôs pushing through a sham trial with no witnesses and no White House documents. He‚Äôs orchestrating a cover up, and trampling over the Constitution as he does it.

When Amazon makes billions in profits but pays $0 in federal income taxes, it‚Äôs corruption‚Äîplain and simple. Our government is working great for a thinner slice at the top, but not so much for everyone else.  
The Latino community has been at the forefront of the fight for social, racial and economic justice‚Äîleading with unwavering courage. As president, I will continue to listen and learn from the community. And I will ask you to hold me accountable for that every single day. 
We march to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And we fight to realize his dream of social, racial, and economic justice. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency has been a dark time‚Äîbut it won‚Äôt end just because he's left office. Rooting out corruption and incompetence, rebuilding our government, and ensuring it will work for the people will require painstaking work. I've got a serious plan to get it done.
Our government officials can best serve the American public when they reflect the diversity of the country itself. That's why I'll build a Cabinet and senior leadership team that reflects the full diversity of America.
Under the Trump administration, we've seen appointees who are actively hostile to the missions of their agencies, like Secretary Betsy DeVos, who doesn‚Äôt believe in public education. As president, I'll appoint people who want to fulfill their agency's mission, not undermine it.
I'll move swiftly to appoint new personnel who will undo the Trump administration's disastrous policies. I'll adopt the strictest anti-corruption hiring rules of any administration in American history.
I will also direct the Justice Department to establish an independent task force to investigate violations of specific anti-corruption and public integrity laws during the Trump administration, with independent authority to pursue any substantiated violations.
On day one of my presidency, I will take aggressive steps to root out the corruption and incompetence of the Trump administration, starting by removing all political appointees, except those necessary to preserve continuity and protect national security.
I know how to get our government working for the people because I‚Äôve done it before. In 2010 President Obama picked me to get the CFPB up and running. We recruited a mission-driven staff, set up the organization, and it acted swiftly to protect Americans from financial predators.
Donald Trump has done serious damage to our government. He's left key positions unfilled. Of those he has filled, he‚Äôs appointed lobbyists, campaign donors, and cronies. His current vindictive actions mean he's likely to do everything he can to undermine the next president.
One year from today, the next president will begin her first full day of work. She‚Äôll inherit a government in crisis, infected by corruption, and will need the expertise and drive to rebuild it and ensure it works for the people. I've got a plan for that. 
Shahab Dehghani is an Iranian student with a valid F1 visa, returning to finish his education. CBP already held him overnight. His deportation must be halted, and we must fight the Trump administration's xenophobic policies. 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. awakened the conscience of a nation and challenged us to live up to our highest ideals. So though this is a moment of crisis, I marched with a heart full of hope that together we'll one day achieve the racial, social, and economic justice he dreamed of. 
Virginians voted for candidates who support gun violence prevention legislation. The majority of Americans‚Äîincluding a majority of gun owners‚Äîsupport reform too. And they will not be silenced or intimidated.  and I will fight alongside you to end gun violence. 
For-profit detention companies donated generously to Donald Trump, and they've made millions implementing Trump‚Äôs cruel immigration policies. It's corruption, pure and simple. I'll fight to permanently ban for-profit prisons and detention centers.

Republicans and the Trump administration are hoping that the Supreme Court will back their extreme plans to limit access to abortion and birth control‚Äîwhich is why I've got a plan to protect both no matter what the Supreme Court does. Enough is enough. 
Amazon made over $10 billion in profits but paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2018. That won‚Äôt happen when I'm president. Use this calculator to find out how much big corporations would pay when they pay their fair share. 
The Trump administration wants to weaken the law that bars American companies from bribing foreign officials. That‚Äôs corruption, plain and simple. I have a plan to reform our global financial system‚Äîand fight corruption at home and abroad.

It‚Äôs hard to be a small business owner, especially when you have to pay much more in taxes than companies like Amazon.My administration will fight the influence of corporate money to make our government work for the people‚Äînot giant corporations. 
And we do that by investing in Black Americans and creating opportunity. The fights for social, racial, and economic justice belong to all of us‚Äîand when I‚Äôm president, that truth will inform our policies and our actions.
For generations, the federal government has prevented African Americans from building wealth and financial security. It's time for our government to acknowledge its actions and step in to make opportunity available for African American communities. 
Black Wall Street was defined by the human spirit. So the community was rebuilt relatively quickly, peaking in the 1940s. But it declined in the sixties and seventies because of gentrification and failure to have a systematic mentorship process in place.
In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat white nationalist violence and associated acts of terror. 
The men responsible for killing hundreds of innocent African Americans committed an act of domestic terrorism, but they were never held accountable. The search for the victims‚Äô mass graves continues to this day, as does the domestic terrorism threat of white nationalism.
While we can never undo this hateful act of domestic terrorism or the pain and suffering it inflicted on the Black community, we all must do our part to dismantle the legacy of systemic racism and oppression that was left in its wake‚Äîand that starts with justice and opportunity.
I had the chance to visit the site of the Tulsa Race Massacre‚Äîa terrible chapter in our nation's history.
Nearly 100 years ago, mobs of white residents descended on Black Wall Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma, ransacking Black businesses and murdering hundreds of African Americans. The Tulsa Race Massacre was one of the worst incidents of racist violence in our nation's history.

2020 is our chance to stand up to Big Money and make our government work for working people. In Newton, Iowa, and I spoke with voters about how a Warren administration will do just that. 
Let‚Äôs be clear: Our government should make health policy based on what‚Äôs good for the American people, not what‚Äôs good for Donald Trump.

A Warren administration will never suck up to those who want to take power away from working people. I‚Äôve led the effort to end anti-worker right-to-work laws, and as president, I‚Äôll make it easier to join a union. 
I‚Äôm about to return this survey to the National Right to Work Committee. 
Decades of institutionalized racism have targeted Black and Brown communities and destroyed their families. To face our mass incarceration problem, we need to prioritize rehabilitation and tackle the problem at its roots. 
Our broken capital punishment system has decided the fate of too many people, especially people of color. We must end the death penalty in America for good. 
Not only are Barclays bankers flat-out wrong about my  scared. The wealthy and the well-connected are terrified of losing their power and profits, but it‚Äôs time to put power where it belongs: In the hands of working people.
Student loan debt is a crisis‚Äîand it's only growing larger. This is crushing an entire generation and holding back our economy. That's why I will act on day one of my presidency to start cancelling student debt and getting relief to families.

The president not only undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain‚Äîhe also broke the law. He must be held accountable or he will continue breaking the law and putting the country at risk. 
The people of Puerto Rico have shown incredible strength and resilience in the face of multiple disasters, and we cannot forget or ignore their suffering. I'll fight to ensure they get the aid and resources they need to recover.
And as we fight the climate crisis, I will make environmental justice a core part of our fight, ensuring that communities in Puerto Rico on the front lines of this crisis receive the pre-disaster mitigation and post-disaster aid they need and deserve. 
I've got a plan to provide comprehensive debt relief to Puerto Rico, which will help rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure after these devastating natural disasters. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs cruel indifference to Puerto Rico's suffering is only a small part of the problem. Puerto Rico is dealing with a debt crisis, fueled in part by Wall Street firms that are using their desperation as just another opportunity to make a profit.
The Trump administration, meanwhile, has been sitting on billions of dollars of disaster aid that Congress appropriated to provide Puerto Rico with relief.
Puerto Rico was on its way to recovering from multiple devastating hurricanes‚Äîand these earthquakes are only compounding the damage to local infrastructure.
The last few weeks have been terrifying for the people of Puerto Rico. Hundreds of earthquakes have struck the area, some of which have caused devastating damage. Homes have been destroyed‚Äîor are so unstable that families are afraid to sleep inside.
Lev Parnas's interview on tonight is damning. He's an associate of Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and implicated Trump in a criminal extortion scheme. How can any Senator argue that we don't need a real trial, with witnesses and documents?

I stand with the people of Puerto Rico. Trump should release the full amount of natural disaster aid that Congress appropriated. Lives are at stake. 
Imagine a country where the decisions made in Washington aren‚Äôt simply bought and paid for by lobbyists and big donors. Imagine a country where the fossil fuel industry and the NRA don‚Äôt have a death grip on Congress.We have to root out Washington corruption.
This is corruption, plain and simple. We will not defeat the climate crisis if our government agencies are packed with people who have ties to the fossil fuel industry. Fighting corruption must be at the center of our fight against climate change. 
These restrictions on the press go against the constitutional right of freedom of the press, and have absolutely nothing to do with ensuring security. The American people need and deserve transparency and accountability during the impeachment trial. 
The revelations in these text messages are shocking, and we must get to the bottom of them. I stand with Ambassador Yovanovitch and all of our diplomats, who deserve to be supported and protected by our government‚Äînot undermined or threatened. 
As looks to expand NAS Fallon, it hasn‚Äôt meaningfully consulted and worked with the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe. That‚Äôs unacceptable. As president, I‚Äôll seek Tribal Nations‚Äô free, prior, informed consent for decisions affecting their lands. 
Student loan debt is widening the racial wealth gap. Enough is enough.  
I saw the warning signs of the student loan debt crisis more than a decade ago. Families can't wait any longer for relief. That's why I'll use every tool a president has to start providing relief on day one of my presidency.

I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope because this is our moment in history. Our moment when no one is left on the sidelines‚Äîour moment when we build the movement to make real change.  
 Thank you I‚Äôm happy to have you in this fight for big, structural change.
Two of my brothers are Republicans. There's a lot we disagree on, but there's a whole lot we agree on. One big thing: They're furious that giant corporations making billions of dollars in profits are paying $0 in federal income taxes. We must root out corruption.  
If we want to make any progress on climate change, gun safety, health care, and all of the other issues that matter to us, then we need to root out corruption in Washington.  
We can let people experience what health care is like when it's just you and your medical professional‚Äîwith no health insurance company standing in the way.  
This is our moment to build the movement to make real change. Hope and courage‚Äîthat is how I will make you proud every day as your nominee, and as the first woman president of the United States of America. 
I came to the  tonight with a heart filled with hope, because I see this as our moment in history. Our moment when no one is left on the sidelines, our moment when we understand that it comes to us to decide the future of this country.
We didn‚Äôt talk about trans women of color who are at risk, Black infant mortality, climate change that hits Black communities, farmers who are barely holding on, people struggling with mental illness. 
During the  break, I made notes on what we didn't get to talk about: The disability community struggling for true equality, how gun violence worries every parent in this country, how children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink.
I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It says that no one is above the law‚Äîand that includes the president. If we have an impeachment trial, I will be there because it is my responsibility.  
I just stepped off the  stage feeling energized by our fight for big, structural change. And I just heard from my team: We‚Äôre close to meeting our mid-month fundraising goal. Will you chip in $3 before midnight?

We have a chance to unite as Democrats, independents, and Republicans. I‚Äôm building the grassroots movement leading the fight. We‚Äôre going to make America work for everyone‚Äînot just the rich and powerful. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to beat Trump. 
Two of my brothers are Republicans. There are a lot of things we disagree on, but there's a whole lot we agree on: My brothers are furious over giant corporations making billions of dollars in profits and paying zero in corporate taxes. We must root out corruption. 
People are suffering. We must get as much help to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible‚Äîand I‚Äôve worked out a plan so we can do that without raising taxes on the middle class.  
We‚Äôve known about the climate crisis for decades. But the fossil fuel industry came in to make big money and stop change. We must take back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate and on all of the issues. 
Climate change threatens every living thing. On day one, I‚Äôll do everything a president can do all by herself to fight this crisis: Roll back the changes that Trump is putting in place, stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands, and end offshore drilling. 
The impeachment trial will show that this is the most corrupt administration of our lives. That‚Äôs what lies at the heart of it‚ÄîTrump putting Trump first. We need to draw that distinction, and show that Democrats are fighting on the side of the people. 
Some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution. It says that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. We have an impeachment trial, and I will be there because it is my responsibility. 
In 2008, people asked if an African American could be elected president of the United States. We said yes, stood behind our candidate‚Äîand changed America.  
We need a  in America. We need to ask giant corporations to pay their fair share. That‚Äôs how we build an economy that works for everyone, bring down the national debt, and invest in our kids and our future.

As a young mom, child care would have sunk me if it weren‚Äôt for my Aunt Bee. My plan is  paid for with my  so we can cover child care for all of our children and provide universal pre-k for every 3 year-old and 4 year-old. 
We have to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible. My  plan does that without raising taxes on middle-class families by one penny. On day one, I will cut the cost of drugs like insulin and EpiPens that Americans rely on. 
We need to start with what's happening in America: People are suffering. 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription‚Äîand couldn't afford to have the prescription filled. Let‚Äôs be clear: We need  
Keep in mind that the men on this stage have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every race are the women‚ÄîAmy and me.  
The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can‚Äôt pull our party together‚Äîor someone who takes big parts of the democratic constituency for granted. We need a candidate who will excite all parts of our party and bring everyone in. 
Can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on the  stage tonight. Collectively, they have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they‚Äôve been in are the women: and me. 
I led the fight against the trade deals that weren‚Äôt in the interest of the American people, American workers, or the environment. We have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting. And they are hurting because of Donald Trump's initiated trade wars. 
We need a policy that actually helps our workers and our farmers. The USMCA is a modest improvement. I believe we should accept that relief, try to help the people who need help, and then we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal. 
 It's time to bring our combat troops home. knows‚Äîwe can't ask our military to solve problems that cannot be solved‚Ä¶
 The principal job of the Commander-In-Chief is to keep America safe‚Äîand has the judgment to do the job. 
We need authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the Constitution provides, and that is what I will do as Commander-In-Chief. 
We have to stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We need to work with our allies, and use our economic and diplomatic tools.We need to get our combat troops out of the Middle East‚Äînow. 
We have a revolving door in Washington between the defense industry and the Pentagon. That‚Äôs corruption‚Å†‚Äîand as president, I‚Äôll block that revolving door and cut our defense budget so the defense industry isn‚Äôt calling the shots. 
The job of the Commander-in-Chief is to keep America safe. That's about judgment. I've sat on the Senate Armed Services committee, I've worked with our generals, I‚Äôve visited our troops. My 3 brothers were in the military‚ÄîI know how much military families sacrifice. 
This is our moment to fight hard for big, bold ideas. Let's go!

Big banks want you to believe that people who file for bankruptcy are reckless or irresponsible. The truth is that they're struggling, and just one disaster is enough to send them over a cliff. They don't need shaming‚Äîthey need relief.

 Fact: plan to call for mass student debt cancellation on day one falls within the power ; authority of the Pr‚Ä¶
After I dropped out of school, I thought my dream of going to college and becoming a teacher was over. But I found a commuter college where tuition was $50 a semester‚Äîand I got to live my dream.I'm fighting so everyone can have the same opportunities I did.
Canceling student loan debt is a racial justice issue.  
Circulating images of Democrats in hijab or a turban as a way of insulting them denigrates the faith of millions of Muslims and Sikhs. Islamophobia and racism have no place in the Oval Office. No American should have to worry about their faith being denigrated for political gain.
Enough is enough. We have to cancel student loan debt‚Äîand make public two- and four-year college and technical school tuition free so we never end up in this crisis again. 
If you were no longer tied to your job in order to pay off student loan debt, where would you go? 
Families can't wait. Big, structural change will start on day one. 
 and I share a vision of America as a country where every family has the opportunity to thrive. And we're fighting to build it‚Äîtogether. 
Thank you, You've been a powerful voice holding the Trump administration accountable in the House, and I'm proud to have you on  
The future of our economy and a generation of student loan borrowers are at risk, and we must use every tool and opportunity we have to help them. We can't let corruption in Washington hold back big, structural change. I‚Äôm committed to seeing this fight through‚Äîno matter what.
I will also use all the tools available to me to address the racial disparities in higher education, crack down on for-profit institutions, and eliminate predatory lending.
Understand this: The Department of Education has broad authority to end the student loan debt crisis. When I'm president, I plan to use that authority.
I made sure Congress provided $700 million in a relief fund for borrowers who dedicated their lives to public service but missed technical requirements for loan forgiveness, and I fought to cancel loans for 80,000 students who were cheated by Corinthian Colleges.
When I was elected to the Senate, I used every opportunity and tool available to ease the burden of student debt. I fought to lower interest rates, refinance loans, and hold loan servicers and debt collectors accountable for breaking the law and hurting borrowers.
We have a student loan crisis‚Äîand we can't afford to wait for Congress to act. I‚Äôve already proposed a student loan debt cancellation plan, and on day one of my presidency, I‚Äôll use existing laws to start providing that debt cancellation immediately. 
 Thank you, I‚Äôm proud to be in this fight alongside you for big, structural change.
This is how we're going to make big, structural change‚Äîtogether. Watch our new Iowa ad! 
If the only way to run for president of the United States is either to be a billionaire or to suck up to billionaires, then we're going to have a country that works better for billionaires‚Äîand worse for everyone else. 
I support the right of the people of Iran to peacefully protest against their corrupt government. But this isn‚Äôt about us. We should support them, including by lifting the Muslim Ban‚Äînot try to engineer regime change or recklessly risk a war.

Everywhere I go, I hear stories of families like mine‚Äîhanging on to their place in the middle class. They're worried about a health crisis, a lost job, losing their house or their car. But they still have hope‚Äîand they're ready to fight for the America they know we can be. 
We need a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. In Marshalltown, Iowa, and I talked about how we can build a country where every single family has the opportunity to thrive. 
We know what's broken in this country, and we know how to fix it. But widely popular policies are stuck. If we want to make big, structural change, we can‚Äôt let corruption in Washington hold up the changes we desperately need to make. It‚Äôs time to get rid of the filibuster.

There are still huge problems with our bankruptcy laws today, in large part due to harmful provisions in the 2005 bankruptcy bill. It‚Äôs why I have a plan to overhaul consumer bankruptcy rules in this country and restore the middle class. 
My response was to study contracts, finance, and‚Äîmost of all‚Äîeconomic failure, to learn everything I could. And I started a ten-year fight against the banking industry‚Äôs efforts to change our bankruptcy laws so they could squeeze everything they could out of working families.
I don‚Äôt think my dad ever spoke the word ‚Äúbankruptcy,‚Äù at least not when I was around. He and I were both afraid of falling off the financial cliff. His response was to not talk about money or what might happen if it ran out. He stayed away from sores that hurt. I poked at them.
I spent most of my career studying one simple question: Why do American families go broke? Whenever someone asked my daddy about my bankruptcy research, I noticed that he would look off and say something like ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs special, that one,‚Äù and then move on to something else.

I'll never stop fighting for the big, structural change we need. 
Laws criminalizing homelessness disproportionately harm people with disabilities. We need to invest our resources in ending homelessness and giving people the services they need, not arresting them.

Donald Trump is seemingly doubling down on his bigotry and xenophobia. Let‚Äôs be clear: I‚Äôll reverse the Muslim Ban on my first day in office, and I won‚Äôt stop fighting against policies that scapegoat and hurt Muslim communities and families. 
From refusing medical care to expanding the definition of ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù to justify denying green cards, the Trump administration has enacted an inhumane immigration agenda that has coupled xenophobia with ableism. As president, I'll protect immigrants with disabilities. 
Donald Trump's first concern on national security issues is not the security of the United States. It's Donald Trump's own political skin. This is reckless and we must speak out.

 I'll fight to end the loss of SSI benefits for individuals that are admitted to medical facilities or emergency homeless shelters for longer periods of time. I‚Äôll also expand SSI to citizens in territories like Puerto Rico to establish equal rights to SSI for all. 
 People with disabilities deserve financial security. My plan increases SSI to the federal poverty line, revises income limits, and ends rules that force people to choose between critical benefits and financial independence, saving, or marrying the person they love. 
 I‚Äôll fight to make Election Day a national holiday, require all federal elections to have a minimum of 15 days of early voting, expand voting hours, allow the option to vote with a sworn statement of identity instead of an ID, and offer voting by mail.

 Thank you and for hosting this chat! I look forward to working with  to build a truly inclusive country.
 What are the things that you're fighting for‚Äîand how can leaders in government be better listeners? 
 Disability will not be an afterthought in my administration‚Äîit will be a priority. We all do better when everyone has the opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of life, and together, I know we can realize a truly inclusive world. 
 We also have a volunteer working group of leaders in the disability community who help us connect with the larger community. My campaign‚Äîand my administration‚Äîwill always seek the input of the community as we govern. 
 We have staff with disabilities across the campaign. Their lived experiences and talents help foster an inclusive and accessible campaign. 
 As president, I will fight alongside the disability community for justice across all aspects of life and to fulfill the goals of the ADA‚Äîequal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self sufficiency. 
 Last week‚Äîin collaboration with advocates and thanks to hundreds of emails, letters, and selfie line conversations‚ÄîI released my plan to protect the rights and equality of people with disabilities:  
 All policy issues are disability policy issues, which is why I‚Äôve approached many of my previous plans with a disability rights lens, from criminal justice reform, to ensuring a high-quality public education for all, to strengthening our democracy. 
 From fostering an inclusive economy and ensuring access to affordable, quality health care for everyone to developing new technology and responding to climate change, we must put disability rights front and center. 
 People with disabilities are still fighting for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion‚Äîand if we want to build a country for everyone, we need to work together to combat ableism and build big, structural change. 
 The disability community has been fighting for a more just future and a better country for everyone. From the fights to protect the ACA to the stories I‚Äôve heard at town halls and the letters I've been sent, I‚Äôve been so grateful to them for sharing their stories. 
 We have campaign staff with disabilities across the campaign and a Director of Disability Outreach to coordinate with the community. From offices to event spaces to selfie lines, we're committed to making our campaign accessible. 
 I'm committed to making my campaign inclusive. We spent months listening to and working with a volunteer working group of leaders in the disability community to develop our plan to protect the rights and equality of people with disabilities. 
I look forward to answering your questions at our first-ever  Twitter Town Hall! 
I spent most of my career studying why American families go broke. When I saw how the economy was rigged against working families‚Äîhow the giant banks rigged the bankruptcy system to squeeze struggling families‚ÄîI decided to get into this fight. 
Looking forward to joining the  table on shortly‚Äîtune in! 
My heart and thoughts are with the people of Puerto Rico today. I know they are resilient and I'll fight to ensure they receive the disaster assistance they need and deserve to recover from these earthquakes. 
The fundamental question: Who should our democracy work for‚Äîthe wealthy and the well-connected, or everyone else? I made the decision to run a grassroots campaign instead of sucking up to billionaires. If you think that's the right way to run, join us:  
The banking industry wants you to believe people who file for bankruptcy are reckless or irresponsible. The truth is that they're struggling with rising costs and flat wages. One crisis is enough to send them over the edge. They don‚Äôt need shaming. They need relief.
Finally, I'll close the loopholes that allow the wealthy and corporate creditors to abuse the bankruptcy system at the expense of everyone else.
Bankruptcy also doesn‚Äôt affect all people equally. Women and people of color are more likely to file for bankruptcy, which is partly a reflection of wealth and income disparities. I'll take additional steps to target specific problems to help eliminate these shameful disparities.
My plan also makes it easier for people to protect their homes and cars in bankruptcy so they can start from a better foundation as they try to rebuild their financial lives.
We have a student loan debt crisis in America in part because our bankruptcy system makes it nearly impossible to get rid of that debt, even when you have nothing left. While I'm fighting to cancel student loan debt, I'll also fight to make that debt dischargeable in bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy law places certain spending limitations on people while they‚Äôre in the process of bankruptcy. My plan pares back some of those burdensome limits‚Äîlike those that prevent families from paying rent‚Äîso families have a chance to recover after the bankruptcy process.
My plan starts by making it easier for people being crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy by streamlining the process, reducing the costs of filing, and giving people more flexibility in bankruptcy to find solutions that match their financial problems.
In 2005, the banking industry pushed through a bill to change our bankruptcy laws so they could squeeze everything they could out of families. The bill hit working families hard and resulted in 250,000 more foreclosures during the financial crisis. It's time for an overhaul.
I spent most of my career studying why American families go broke. What I discovered was that they weren't reckless or irresponsible‚Äîthey were being squeezed by an economy that forced them to take on more debt, and one bad break sent them tumbling over the edge.
This economy is pushing struggling families to the breaking point, and our bankruptcy laws make it harder for them to get back on their feet. That's not right. I've got a plan to overhaul our consumer bankruptcy rules. 
Covered a lot of ground on our campaign to Kate McKinnon‚Äôs impression of me. I also told I‚Äôll be calling some grassroots donors who donate today to say thank you. Chip in $3 now, and I could call you next!

At town halls in Davenport, Iowa, and across the country, people tell me about what's broken‚Äîabout the things they're afraid of. But in spite of the fear, they have hope that things can change, because they believe in America, and in each other. And I believe, too. 
 I hate to say ‚ÄúI told you so,‚Äù but... I told you so!

Donald Trump is dangerous. He's repeatedly undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain. He‚Äôs escalated tensions and driven crises. We cannot allow his reckless actions to drag us back into another war. 
These reports are deeply disturbing. Iranian Americans have the same rights as all other U.S. citizens and should be treated with dignity and respect at our border‚Äînot bigoted, xenophobic scrutiny. 
Right now our government and our economy are working great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not so much for everyone else. Every family should have the opportunity to thrive, and and I are going to fight for that‚Äîtogether. 
The way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values‚Äîhere in Manchester, Iowa, and everywhere in America. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win. 
Thank you, You‚Äôve been a powerful voice for bold, progressive change and I‚Äôm honored to have your support. Together, we'll fight to make sure every single family in America has a path to opportunity. 
Now let‚Äôs make sure we value their work! I‚Äôve got a plan to boost wages for women of color and open up new pathways to the leadership positions they deserve.  
We have to pick up each other's fights. Because that's how we'll build a better America for our kids and grandkids‚Äîby fighting together. 
Our achievements weren't born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams. Our best moments have been when we see a challenge and mobilize to meet it head-on. In Hanover, New Hampshire, and all across the country, Americans are ready to fight for a brighter future. 
Congratulations to new dads Daniel and Scott‚Äîa double woo-hoo thank you for knocking doors with in Ohio! 
I‚Äôm so grateful for the hard work of organizers like 
I have the best team. Here‚Äôs how they get our selfie lines done so that we can take great photos together! 
I look forward to chatting with  this Tuesday! 
 Elizabeth Warren on the Qasem Soleimani strike: "I think that the question that we ought to focus on is why now? Why not a mon‚Ä¶
 WATCH: Sen. Elizabeth Warren says that "people are asking" why the Iran strike took place now.   
Yesterday, Reagan and Elle asked me two important questions in Iowa. Here are my answers: 
 If you don‚Äôt know, now you know! ü§≥üì∏ We want to see your  ‚Äòem using hashtag  
 Tell Emery I'm so sorry that they couldn't join us‚Äîbut they‚Äôre an important part of this fight, and I'm proud to fight alongside them!
Our selfie line is an opportunity to listen to your stories and hear why you got in this fight. Selfie by selfie, photo by photo, person by person‚Äîwe‚Äôre growing our grassroots movement together. 
Thank you, 
Councilwoman is right. My heart is in solidarity with the Iranian-American community. We must fight for our democracy now more than ever so that it has space for all our communities. 
You are threatening to commit war crimes. We are not at war with Iran. The American people do not want a war with Iran. This is a democracy. You do not get to start a war with Iran, and your threats put our troops and diplomats at greater risk. Stop. 
Before I hit the photo line, I put on my sneakers. 
It‚Äôs official:  100,000 in Manchester, Iowa! I don‚Äôt spend my time asking rich donors for big checks‚ÄîI  spend it with voters. Our selfie line gives me a moment (or 100,000) to meet our movement. 
Racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered and protected by Donald Trump‚Äîand we‚Äôre seeing the violent consequences.We have to get Trump out of the White House and fight against white nationalist violence. 
We need to call out the fact that Americans with disabilities are excluded from economic opportunity and denied financial security. I have a plan to fight and change that.
About time. I called for a criminal investigation of the Wells Fargo CEO in 2016, and successfully pushed for the bank's board members to be held accountable.When CEOs and top bankers break the law, they should go to jail‚Äîjust like anyone else. 
Woo-hoo! Glad to see Okies hard at work in my home state.As we get closer to voting, having conversations with voters is one of the most important things we can do. The good news is you can start making calls now, from wherever you are!  
The problem isn't big government versus small government.The problem is a government that's been captured by the rich and powerful.The solution is creating a government that works for everyone‚Äînot just the wealthy and well-connected.
New Hampshire's legislature passed a bill to raise the minimum wage‚Äîand Gov. Sununu vetoed it.We need to raise the federal minimum wage so everyone, in every state, has a living wage that can support themselves and their families. 
 Your favorite buttons‚Äînow in braille! 
If you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness, you're more than halfway there. First you have to see it. Then we fight for it. Between selfies and pinkie promises in Concord, I heard those dreams. Together, we'll build that future. 
Just a few hours into the new year, another trans American was killed in a senseless act of gun violence.Dustin Parker was a father, a husband, and an advocate who looked out for his community. We must fight for justice for him and all trans Americans. 
Nobody fighting for climate action should be afraid that they‚Äôre going to lose their job. In a Warren administration, I will fight to protect and strengthen workers‚Äô voices, especially those who are holding their employers accountable. 
Too many "American" companies have only one real loyalty: The short-term interests of their shareholders. If they can outsource jobs to save a nickel, that‚Äôs exactly what they'll do.We have to defend good American jobs‚Äîand I've got a plan for that. 
The catastrophic scenes from Australia's wildfires should alarm all of us. Climate change is driving even more dangerous and destructive fires across the world, from California to New South Wales‚Äîand we must fight together to defeat this crisis. 
The Trump administration is expanding its dangerous and cruel "Remain in Mexico" policy, putting the lives of even more asylum seekers at risk. As president, I'll reverse this policy and ensure that asylum seekers are welcomed. 
People with disabilities, like Sarah, are still fighting for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion‚Äîand I'll be fighting alongside them. Together, we built a plan to fight for justice and inclusion. 
Donald Trump is dangerous and reckless. He's escalated crises and betrayed our partners. He's undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain.We cannot allow him to drag us back into another war. We must speak out.
All three of my brothers served in uniform. I know the sacrifices we ask of them and their families. Trump‚Äôs actions put every service member and diplomat in the region at risk. This is a moment for vigilance‚Äîfor Americans to speak up and speak out. No more Middle East wars.
Donald Trump ripped up an Iran nuclear deal that was working. He‚Äôs repeatedly escalated tensions. Now he‚Äôs assassinated a senior foreign military official. He‚Äôs been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office‚Äîbut the American people won‚Äôt stand for it.
We‚Äôre on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East‚Äîone that would be devastating in terms of lives lost and resources wasted. We‚Äôre not here by accident. We‚Äôre here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here.
I called Laura, a teacher, to say thank you. We agreed: We need a teacher in the White House! I'm so grateful for every single person who chips in to our grassroots campaign. This is how we can win‚Äîtogether. 
In 2019, nearly one million donors pitched in to raise more than $71 million for our grassroots movement‚Äîwith zero closed-door fundraisers. I'm so deeply grateful for everyone supporting our campaign. Team Warren is ready to dream big, fight hard, and win! 
Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war.
Right now, employers are allowed to pay people with disabilities wages as low as 4¬¢ per hour. This is shameful. People with disabilities have the same rights to fair wages and economic security as everyone else. I'll fight to end the subminimum wage. 
 New technology can bring many positive changes for people with disabilities‚Äîbut we have to make sure it isn't used in ways‚Ä¶
 Congressman Dan Lipinski signed on to a brief calling for the overturning of Roe v. Wade. His position in Congress jeop‚Ä¶
Republicans want to turn back the clock, outlaw abortion, and deny people reproductive health care‚Äîand they're hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play. We need to take back the Senate and pass federal laws protecting our reproductive rights. 
 Thank you, for making sure we had those details right. I‚Äôm in this fight alongside you all the way!
 I‚Äôm deeply grateful for all of your work on this plan and for your work on the ground in North Carolina, I‚Äôm proud to fight alongside you for justice for people with disabilities.

Issues of racism can't just be issues for Black and Brown women‚Äîthey must be issues for all of us. I talked with on about the Black-white wealth gap, student debt, and how my plans will build an economy that works for everyone. 
Sarah sent me a letter asking me to make sure that people with disabilities like her brother aren't left behind. Sarah, here's my promise to you both: I will fight so he can get all the care and services he needs to live a self-determined life in a community that loves him. 
 I‚Äôm proud to fight alongside you‚Äîfor Xiomara and all our kids. This is how we‚Äôre going to win, together!
 Take it from Rebecca Solnit:  has shown no fear.‚Äù
I‚Äôm fighting for and and all disabled Americans, because no one should be forced to choose between critical benefits and marrying the person they love. 
 Thank you for your tireless advocacy and hard work, I‚Äôm grateful to have you on the working group for this plan!
I'll fight to expand and reform Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income to ensure financial security for all. I'm deeply grateful to for helping shape this conversation‚Äîand look forward to working side by side to enact these changes.
 Thank you, for taking my call and helping build this plan. I‚Äôm proud to work with you!
 Thank you so much for your thoughtful work on this plan and for being a part of Intersectionality is how we get this done! I‚Äôm proud to fight alongside you.
New technology can foster accessibility for people with disabilities‚Äîif it's affordable. My hearing aid law will help bring down costs, and my administration will work to bring down the costs of assistive technologies for everyone who needs them. 
Thank you, Together, we'll fight for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion for all. 
We all do better when everyone has the opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of life. Together, we can realize a truly inclusive world. Because when we organize together, when we fight together, and when we persist together, we can win.
Finally, we must lead the fight for disability rights worldwide. Under Trump, the U.S. has neglected its responsibility to be a leader in human rights, including disability rights. As president, I'll make disability rights a priority in my foreign policy.
As we transition to  I will roll back harmful work requirements, enrollment caps, and Medicaid premiums allowed by the Trump administration‚Äîto ensure that Americans with disabilities can get the care they need.
Health care is a human right, but too many people with disabilities face barriers to quality care. We need a system that empowers all people to live full lives and that reflects our values. That system is 
As we tackle environmental injustices and climate change, we must put disability rights front and center. That means accessible and green housing and transportation‚Äîand inclusive emergency planning, response, and recovery.
For people with disabilities, finding affordable housing can be even more difficult due to limited accessible options and discrimination. My administration will fight to ensure they have a decent, affordable, and safe place to live, and strengthen anti-discrimination protections.
From criminal justice to voting, immigration, and protecting parents with disabilities from discrimination, my administration will safeguard the rights and civil liberties of people with disabilities and work to ensure that our society and democracy are truly inclusive.
My administration will work to bring down the costs of assistive technologies that allow people with disabilities to lead fuller lives. We'll also enforce existing anti-discrimination laws and propose new regulations that specifically address discrimination in technology.
New technology has brought many positive changes for people with disabilities‚Äîbut it can be used in ways that discriminate against them or exclude them from an increasingly digital world. I will fight to ensure that technology is used to advance their interests.
My administration will support children with disabilities, their families, and their educators by providing crucial early interventions and ensuring kids have meaningful access to a high-quality public education. And we'll tackle discriminatory policies and practices head-on.
We must also rewrite the rules of government programs that trap people with disabilities in poverty. No one should be forced to wait months to receive assistance or choose between critical benefits and marrying the person they love. I'll fight to expand and reform these programs.
As president, I'll fight for economic security for people with disabilities by rewriting the rules of the economy to end labor market discrimination and exploitation, and foster inclusivity. That starts with fighting for a $15 minimum wage‚Äîand ending the shameful subminimum wage.
Disability activists have organized for years to fight injustice. 2020 marks the 30th anniversary of the ADA, and though we've made significant progress, we still have a lot of ground to cover. In my administration, disability rights and equality will be a top priority.
People with disabilities are still fighting for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion‚Äîand they‚Äôre not fighting alone. As president, I'll partner with the disability community to combat ableism and fight for justice across all aspects of life. 
Thank you for being a powerful voice, for proposing bold and progressive plans, and for using your campaign to help people who need it now. You made this race stronger‚Äîand you will continue to be a leader in our party and our country for many years to come. 
Americans do big things. That‚Äôs who we are. And our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head on. So let's begin this new year with big dreams and bold plans!
What are your aspirations and dreams for 2020? If you weren't stretched to make ends meet, who would you be? If you weren't crushed by debt, what would you do? If you lived without worrying if you could afford the health care and prescriptions you need, how could you thrive?
Taking the time to see ourselves and our world better than they are today sparks urgency in our hearts and determination in our minds. As we welcome in 2020, let's take a minute to imagine what our country could look like‚Äîwhat our own lives could look like‚Äîin a better future.
As we look ahead to 2020, let's imagine what our country could look like on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the past three years. That future is possible when we believe in ourselves and in each other‚Äîand when we have the courage to fight for it. Happy New Year! 
Juliette chipped in to help meet our end-of-quarter goal, so I called her to say thanks! If you chip in $3‚Äîor whatever you can‚Äîbefore tonight's deadline, I might call you later, too. Dream big, fight hard, and have a safe and happy New Year!  
 Our fight.Our chance.Our movement. 
If I call you on the phone, just call me Elizabeth! I called Keith to say thanks for contributing to this grassroots campaign. And if you chip in $3 (or whatever you can) before tonight's deadline, I could call you next!  
Thank you, Together, we can root out the corruption in Washington and make our democracy work for everyone. 
Imagine the future America you want to live in. That future is possible‚Äîand if we dream big and fight hard, we can build it together. 
I called to thank her for donating to our grassroots campaign and for being a part of We're going to do this‚Äîtogether.Chip in $3 or whatever you can before tonight's deadline, and I could call you soon!  
Woo-hoo! is still sending out a free sticker to anyone who chips in to our campaign‚Äîfrom now until tonight‚Äôs FEC deadline. Chip in $1 or more to claim yours now.

Jonathan chipped in $5 to our campaign, so I gave him a call to say thanks! We talked about my plans to root out corruption in Washington and how we can grow our grassroots movement.Chip in whatever you can and I might call you next!  
In the face of hatred, injustice, and oppression, Black Americans throughout our history have never stopped imagining and fighting for a better tomorrow. Black history‚ÄîAmerican history‚Äîhas shown us the way to the America of our highest ideals.  
If you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years‚Äîthen you are more than halfway there. The first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it.  
There are less than 12 hours until our most important FEC deadline, and our fundraising is still behind last quarter‚Äôs.I‚Äôm counting on grassroots supporters like you to help close the gap. Will you contribute $3 now to help meet our $20 million goal? 
Our achievements and victories were not born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams.  
 Stay strong out there, Isabella. I know that together, we can elect another wave of progressive women up and down the ballot in 2020 and beyond. Let‚Äôs do this!
Our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head on.Fighting back is an act of patriotism.  
Trump‚Äôs reckless decisions to walk away from the Iran Deal and now to launch airstrikes in Iraq without Iraqi government consent have brought us closer to war and endangered U.S. troops and diplomats. We should end the forever wars, not start new ones.
Let us begin tomorrow committed to dream big, fight hard, and win. Happy New Year! 
I believe that when future generations of Americans look back on this time, they will celebrate us for choosing hope over fear. I believe they will see that we fought to build an America of our best values‚Äîan America that works for everyone. 
2020 is our fight: Our chance to rewrite the rules of power in our country. Our chance to come together despite our differences and mobilize a movement for change. 
We know that the America we imagine together is possible when Americans believe in ourselves and in each other‚Äîand when we have the courage to fight for it. 
But we know in our hearts that power in America can rest with the people. We can and we must have an economy and a democracy that finally works for everyone. 
Those with power dump an endless avalanche of excuses, misdirections, and distractions on the American people. It‚Äôs all designed to get us to give up and resign ourselves to the way things are‚Äîwith them in power and everyone else left behind. 
We begin this fight with a hard truth: No one who has power in Washington is going to give it up easily. 
If you can imagine all this‚Äîif you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years‚Äîthen you are more than halfway there. The first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it. 
Imagine an America where no matter the color of your skin, who you love, how you worship, where you were born, or what zip code you live in, you are safe and your opportunities look pretty much like everyone else‚Äôs. 
Imagine an America where the lived experience of women is reflected in committee rooms and corner offices, and yes, even at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
Imagine an America where more women‚Äîwomen of color, LGBTQ+ women, women with diverse backgrounds‚Äîhave more power to make the right decisions for our country. 
Imagine what‚Äôs possible when poor communities and communities of color are no longer dumping grounds for toxic wastes and polluting industries. 
While the survival of every living thing on this planet hangs in the balance, while fossil fuel companies still call the shots in Washington, imagine an America that has come together to beat back the climate crisis and embrace a  
Imagine an America where monthly social security checks are big enough to cover the bills and leave a little extra for home repairs or an occasional meal out‚Äîor maybe birthday presents for the grandchildren. 
Imagine an America where black maternal health is a priority. Imagine an America where, if you get really sick, you can concentrate on getting well‚Äîand not worry about bankruptcy. 
Imagine an America where  ensures health care is a basic human right. Imagine an America where you could get your prescriptions filled, without worrying about the cost. 
Imagine fleeing violence and oppression and finding an America that matches our best values every day and welcomes asylum seekers and refugees with care and compassion. 
Imagine a country where every young adult is treated as so valuable to all of us that technical school, two-year college, or four-year college is tuition-free and ready to welcome every one of them. 
Imagine a country where every child is treated as so valuable to all of us that their education is a top priority. Imagine a country where teachers are deeply respected for the work they do‚Äîand paid accordingly. 
If you were no longer stretched to make ends meet, who would you be? A coach? A volunteer? A parent? And if you could make these changes, what opportunities would it open up, for you? For your children? For your grandchildren? 
If you were no longer paying half your income in rent, what could you do? Pay off your credit cards? Put money in a savings account? Get a dog? (That idea came from Bailey‚Äîbut think about it.) 
If you were no longer tied to your job in order to pay off student loan debt, where would you go? Try a different job? Move back to your hometown? Start your own business? 
Imagine how you could thrive if America was safe for everyone. If you lived in a community without fear‚Äîwithout fear of oppression, of violence, of anti-semitism, white supremacy, and police brutality‚Äîhow would you live your life? 
Imagine what our country could mean for you. Imagine who you could be if America worked for everyone. 
My determination to lead a movement has been forged by the tens of thousands of people who have said they are ready to fight for the country they know we can be. 
My will to fight has been strengthened by the people who have whispered their dreams into my ear. 
My plans for this country have been influenced by letters pressed into my palm by little girls. 
One year into this campaign, you‚Äôve never found me behind closed doors with corporate executives or spending hours on the phone sucking up to rich donors to fund my campaign. 
Over the past year I‚Äôve had the chance to shake hands or hug nearly 100,000 people in more than 180 town halls across the country. We have many differences‚Äîbut we are ready to fight side-by-side for our common aspirations. 
Exactly a year ago today, I got in the race for president. And I made the decision to run a campaign straight from the heart. I am deeply grateful that so many of you have put your full hearts into this campaign, as well. 
On day one, we will start to make big, structural change to end the rigged economy and to create a new set of rules‚Äîrules that give everyone a chance to succeed. 
On day one, we will start to make big, structural change to put the people in charge of our democracy‚Äîso we hear everyone‚Äôs voice and count everyone‚Äôs vote. 
When I am president, we will attack corruption in Washington head-on. We will attack the concentration of power that makes this government work great for the wealthy and well-connected, and not for much of anyone else. 
We come together to imagine this reality because this reality is now within our reach. 
Imagine a country where no politician has to kiss the rings of the rich in order to win elected office. 
Imagine a country where big drug companies and the insurance industry don‚Äôt stand between Americans and the basic health care they need. 
Imagine a country where the NRA and gun industry don‚Äôt get to put their own profits above the safety of our children. 
Imagine a country where private prisons and detention centers don‚Äôt exist and no one makes a profit from locking people up. 
Imagine a country where the fossil fuel industry doesn‚Äôt have a grip on our planet. 
Imagine a country where the decisions made in Washington aren‚Äôt simply bought and paid for by lobbyists and big donors. 
Taking the time to see ourselves and our world better than they are today sparks urgency in our hearts and determination in our minds. 
Imagining alone won‚Äôt be enough. But imagination is powerful. It forces us to contemplate change in our lives; to begin to expect change. 
So, just for a moment, here on the eve of a new year, let us come together to imagine. Imagine what our country will look like‚Äîimagine what your own life will look like‚Äîwhen we finally turn this page in our history. 
Our greatest achievements were not born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams‚Äîof our unique ability to imagine a better world so clearly and thoroughly that we fought for it with everything we had, and turned things we could only imagine into reality. 
We became the world‚Äôs leading industrial producer and simultaneously gave workers the right to join unions and live decent lives. We created breakthroughs in science and technology and connected the world through the internet. We rocketed to the moon. 
Americans do big things. That‚Äôs who we are. And our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head-on. 
We are a nation that fights back. Fighting back is an act of patriotism. 
As we turn the page tomorrow‚Äîinto an election year and a new decade‚Äîthere is a chill of fear in the air. People are afraid, and the danger they feel is real. Our democracy hangs in the balance. And now it comes to us‚Äînow it comes to us to fight back. 
House Democrats upheld their sworn duty and impeached the president. Soon, I will return to the Senate to do mine as well. But unless some Senate Republicans choose truth over politics, Donald Trump will be emboldened to try to cheat his way through another election. 
In the past 12 months, the president has become bolder with his lies and law-breaking. He tried to squeeze a foreign government to advance his own personal fortunes. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have turned into fawning, spineless defenders of his crimes. 
In a few hours, the dawn of a new year will break over America, offering us a moment for pause and reflection. It is normally a moment for optimism. But let‚Äôs face it‚Äîthis year in America has been anything but normal. 
A year ago today, we launched this campaign for big, structural change. In just a few minutes, I'll be speaking live about the optimism I'll be carrying into 2020.  
It's been a year since we launched our campaign and our fight to protect the promise of America‚Äîand since then, our fight has only become more important. In 2020, we will dream big, fight hard, and win. 
Everyone should be free to worship and celebrate without fear. We have to stand up and fight against hate, bigotry, and anti-Semitic violence‚Äîand in a Warren administration, we'll use every tool we have to defeat it.
Call time is a chance for me to talk with grassroots donors and listen to their stories‚Äîregardless of how much they were able to give to our campaign.I‚Äôm making more calls tomorrow! Will you chip in $3 now to help reach our end-of-quarter goal?  
This Tuesday at 11 AM ET, I'll be speaking in Boston on the one-year anniversary of launching this campaign. Bookmark this page now to watch the speech live tomorrow!  
We shouldn't have to live like this. In 2020, we have to fight to put an end to the daily toll of gun violence that is devastating our communities‚Äîincluding mass shootings. 
Climate change. Gun violence. Health care. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix these issues, and the majority of Americans are with us. And yet we don't make change. Why? Corruption, pure and simple. We've got to root it out‚Äîand I've got plans for that.
Here's my advice to young women on running for office: Fight from the heart. That's how you'll be strong, and that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll persuade others to join you. 
Working families in Des Moines and across the country deserve a fighting chance. That‚Äôs why I have a lot of plans‚Äîfrom increasing Social Security benefits to canceling student loan debt‚Äîthat will help rebuild our middle class and put power in the hands of the people. 
 I‚Äôm sorry I missed you‚Äîbut thank you for being in this fight!
It's also time to ensure our government works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I'll end lobbying as we know it‚Äîand I'll shut the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. 
My Real Corporate Profits Tax ensures that very large and profitable companies pay taxes on their reported profits‚Äîno loopholes or exemptions. And I'll make it harder for companies to hide their profits in offshore tax havens. 
Too many corporations are cashing in on all the benefits of America while skipping out on the bill. Companies that make massive profits shouldn't be paying less in federal income taxes than working families. It's time for them to pay their fair share‚Äîand I've got plans for that.
Trump is the most corrupt president in history, and here‚Äôs the latest example of how that corruption helps giant corporations at the expense of small businesses and working families. 
It‚Äôs been a really great year! 
Rich people may have a whole lot more of a lot of things. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they should own a bigger piece of our democracy. 
Fred doesn‚Äôt usually answer unknown numbers, but Bruce and I are glad he picked up today! Chip in $3 now and I could call you soon, too!  
The FEC deadline is in two days‚Äîand my campaign is running short of our $20 million goal.If enough people on Twitter pitch in tonight, we can close the gap and get back on track. Will you chip in $3 now? We can only make this deadline together. 
My heart is with Rep. John Lewis and his family. He‚Äôs always been a fighter, and I know he'll continue making good trouble. Stay strong, John. 
The richest Americans with the biggest fortunes keep getting richer, and the wealth gap just gets wider and wider. We need a  to level the playing field and fund opportunity‚Äîto ensure every family has a chance to succeed. 
 That‚Äôs what I like to hear! I can‚Äôt wait to meet Tabi today.
2020 is our chance to dream big, fight hard‚Äîand win. 
I'm heartsick for the victims of this horrific attack. This is unfortunately just the latest of a series of anti-Semitic attacks in New York and New Jersey. We must fight anti-Semitism and make clear that hateful bigotry has no place in our society. 
 and I look forward to meeting you soon! 
He‚Äôs on vacation, but Logan from Maine still picked up the phone when I called to thank him for being a donor! Logan chipped in $3‚Äîand that $3 makes a difference as we work to close our fundraising gap before the FEC deadline.Will you chip in $3, too?  
Moniqua, a small business owner in Georgia, chipped in $20 to our campaign‚Äîso I just gave her a call to say thanks! This is how I like to spend call time: On the phone with grassroots donors who make it happen. Chip in $3 now and I could call you soon:  
Whenever I meet a little girl, I say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm running for president, because that‚Äôs what girls do." And then we make a pinky promise so they‚Äôll remember. 
I spend my time thanking grassroots donors, because grassroots donors make growing our campaign possible‚Äîand I‚Äôll be calling folks all weekend!
I was grateful to spend time with Rosa yesterday and talk with her about child care workers‚Äô rights. My plans will increase wages for child care workers and make it easier to form a union.

A small group of the wealthiest families gobbled up a massive amount of wealth, while the middle class was hollowed out. This wasn't an accident.Here's how my  will level the playing field. 
Families should be able to get an education without being drowned in debt. They should be able to go to work without child care costs eating up their paychecks. They should be able to get the health care they need without risking bankruptcy.We need big, structural change.
Keep your phone nearby!This weekend, I‚Äôll be calling grassroots donors to thank them for chipping in to our campaign. Will you pitch in $3 tonight? I hope we‚Äôll talk soon. 
We're closing out the decade with a widening wealth gap and millions of families drowning in debt due to the costs of health care and higher education. In 2020, let's fight for big, structural change to build an economy that works for everyone. 
If you make it big‚Äîand I mean really big, top one‚Äëtenth of one percent big‚Äîpitch in a few cents so everyone else gets a chance to make it, too. It‚Äôs really that simple.
Someone had a bit too much Christmas dinner!

The best way to grow the economy isn't by giving more money to billionaires and corporations already sitting on piles of money, but by helping working families struggling with the costs of health care, child care, housing, and education.  
Bruce and I are wishing a very happy Kwanzaa to everyone celebrating this week!
One year ago today, Felipe G√≥mez Alonzo died in CBP custody. He was just eight years old.This Christmas, I'm heartsick for all of the families who won't be celebrating together today because of the Trump administration's cruel treatment of immigrants and asylum-seekers.
From our family to yours: Have a very merry Christmas! 
Bailey wishes you a very Merry Christmas! 
Imagine: Your parents go through all that effort to dress you in your holiday best, take you to see Santa, and all they get is a mildly terrified photo! (I figured it out eventually.) 
I stand with Amazon's workers, who are doing back-breaking work this holiday season. Everyone deserves time to spend with their families. And I know that when workers fight together, they can win. 
I never thought I‚Äôd be back in my high school gym, running for president of the United States. But you know, you don‚Äôt get what you don‚Äôt fight for. 
These are difficult times, and yet my heart is filled with hope. It‚Äôs because of the people I meet at town halls in Cedar Rapids and all across the country: They're struggling, they've got challenges, but they still believe in a better America‚Äîand they're willing to fight for it. 
Our government is working great for the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of everyone else. I‚Äôm fighting for big, structural change to make sure it works for families in North Liberty, Iowa, and working families across the country. 
Our big FEC deadline is approaching‚Äîand tonight, my team will send me a list of new donors so I can check if we‚Äôre on track. If you haven‚Äôt donated to our campaign before, will you chip in $3? We‚Äôre in this fight together. 
Dennis Muilenburg pressured regulators and put profits ahead of the safety of passengers, pilots, and flight attendants. His firing is welcome news‚Äîand long overdue. 
We had our Oklahoma City town hall at my former high school‚Äîwhere my high school debate trophy is still on display! Public school made me, and that debate team gave me so many incredible opportunities. I believe in our public schools, and that's why I'm fighting for them. 
I never thought I'd be back in my high school‚Äîthis time as a candidate for president of the United States. But you don't get what you don't fight for! 
By the time I graduated high school, my folks couldn't even afford a college application‚Äîmuch less four years of college. High school debate gave me amazing opportunities, and it was great to meet Oklahoma‚Äôs state champions! 
Oklahoma, it was good to be home! 
In Ottumwa, Iowa, I talked about how a free press is a powerfully important part of any democracy. My administration will fight to protect journalists and the First Amendment. 
We won‚Äôt make any progress on any of the issues we care about until we root out corruption in Washington‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan for that. 
Real freedom isn‚Äôt letting big corporations prevent workers from taking a better job.  Real freedom is a government ban on non-compete clauses so workers can choose the job that‚Äôs best for them.
Our country's top turkey companies are getting sued for allegedly conspiring to raise prices. Each of the four major meat industries are now under investigation for price-fixing and collusion. Enough. It‚Äôs time to enforce our antitrust laws against Big Ag.

We need to use every tool we have to combat voter suppression. I'll fight to defend our right to vote and build the grassroots movement to win in 2020.

How do we change the perception of a president as a man with a tie? By electing a woman president. 
When John F. Kennedy said we would send a man to the moon in under a decade, people said it'd be impossible. But American ingenuity rose to meet the challenge. Today, we face a new challenge‚Äîclimate change. And American ingenuity can rise again to meet it.  
We need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction with the corruption of the Trump administration. We need to show that we're willing to fight, not just for the wealthy and well-connected, but for everyone else. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in this fight. 
The way I see it, this election is about who our government is going to work for‚Äîthe wealthy and the well-connected, or working families like the ones I met in Burlington, Iowa?I know which side I'm on. I'm fighting so that our government and our economy work for everyone. 
America has a long and proud history of rising to the challenges that have faced this country‚Äîand defeating the climate crisis is no exception. 
Let‚Äôs be clear: Dreamers are  despite the Trump administration‚Äôs cruelty. From showing up for the  DACA hearings, to my plan to protect immigrants, our campaign stands with Dreamers all the way.

Hateful, bigoted language has violent consequences, and we've seen that in the surge of hate crimes since 2016. I'm heartsick for this teenager and her family, and I‚Äôm sending all my thoughts for a speedy recovery. 
Another Black trans woman, Yahira Nesby, was killed. This epidemic keeps growing, and we need to use every tool we have to end it. 
Atatiana Jefferson should still be alive‚Äîbut hopefully now she and her family can have some justice. Now it's on us to fight for real reform, including federal standards for the use of force. 
The Trump administration is trying to throw up every barrier they can to make it harder for people to get the care they need. We have to fight back‚Äîand we need to elect a president who will protect the right to an abortion. 
Families are struggling. They're working hard‚Äîeven working multiple jobs‚Äîand yet sometimes they're just barely scraping by. It's time to make sure our economy is working for working people‚Äîin Keokuk, Iowa, and across the country.

The transition to clean energy is an opportunity to transform our economy, creating new industries and greatly expanding others. My administration will create new financing tools to unlock investments to tackle climate change, including a Green Bank and Green Victory Bonds.
As part of my 100% Clean Energy Plan, I'll take action to achieve zero-carbon pollution from all new buildings, and improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings. This will create over 970,000 new jobs.
America‚Äôs water infrastructure is crumbling, leaving us vulnerable to climate crises and putting our drinking water at risk. My administration will protect Americans by rebuilding our nation's water infrastructure‚Äîand creating about 190,000 good, union jobs.
Transportation is one of the largest sources of U.S. carbon pollution. As we rebuild our crumbling transportation infrastructure, we can create a transportation system powered by electricity rather than fossil fuels, build in climate resiliency, and create about 2.6 million jobs.
The clean energy sector is rapidly expanding‚Äîand as part of my 100% Clean Energy Plan, my administration will focus on rebuilding and repowering our energy grid, creating 6.8 million good jobs, while cutting carbon pollution.
To develop the green workforce of the future, we'll invest in expanding job training, and we'll make sure no worker is left behind as we transition to a clean economy. My administration will work hand-in-hand with unions to ensure these jobs have good wages and strong benefits.
I mean it when I say that defeating the climate crisis will be a top priority in my administration. My plans will enact a climate change agenda that not only reduces our carbon emissions, but also jumpstarts our economy and creates millions of new jobs.
When faced with seemingly impossible challenges, American ingenuity has risen to meet them. We can do it again and defeat the climate crisis. The  is an opportunity to invest in a green economy and create 10.6 million new jobs.

Around the world, protestors are rising up against corruption and economic inequality. The United States must stand with them and lead the way to fight financial corruption here at home and around the world.

We must overturn Citizens United with a constitutional amendment to end the corruption of our campaigns and elections‚Äîbut there are also steps we can take now. I'll fight to update campaign finance laws to limit foreign interference and bring dark money into the light.
I‚Äôll work with Congress to enact anti-money laundering reforms and update basic financial integrity requirements. I‚Äôll expand real estate disclosure requirements. I'll strengthen enforcement against financial institutions and clamp down on dark money enablers here in the U.S.
We need a president who will fight back against global financial corruption‚Äîand that starts here at home. The United States is at the center of the global financial system and helps to shape international financial rules. We have the leverage to strengthen global transparency.
Rather than fighting for transparency, Donald Trump has spent his career embracing shady deals and exploiting legal loopholes. He‚Äôs repeatedly partnered with shady actors on real estate deals that reek of money laundering, corruption, and fraud.

Giant companies are raking in profits while squeezing working families to the breaking point. It's time to put more power in the hands of workers. My plan ensures that the 27 million part-time workers in America are treated with respect and can build a future for their families.
And it's time to remove the perverse incentives that keep giant corporations from making their workers full-time. I'll extend leave and benefit protections to part-time workers, and require employers to offer additional hours to existing part-time workers before hiring new ones.
My plan will give workers who work at companies with more than 15 employees the rest they desperately need by guaranteeing workers 11 hours between shifts and compensating them with higher pay for hours voluntarily worked within that window.
Under my Fair Workweek Plan, employers with 15 or more employees will be required to give two weeks‚Äô advance notice of work schedules. And employees will be empowered to ask for schedules that work for them, without fear of retaliation.
These unpredictable schedules make it nearly impossible to work another job, go back to school, or schedule child care. And workers of color‚Äîespecially women of color‚Äîbear the brunt of these abusive scheduling practices.
Millions of workers face unpredictable schedules that can change dramatically day-to-day‚Äîeven by the hour‚Äîwith almost no advance warning. A third of workers involuntarily work part-time because they aren't assigned enough hours by giant corporations trying to keep costs down.
As corporations rake in larger profits, working families across the country are getting crushed by rising costs and wages that are barely budging. Adding to their challenges, many employers‚Äîespecially in the retail and service industries‚Äîare using algorithms to assign schedules.
Unpredictable work schedules are leaving too many part-time workers with no control over their time and not enough hours to make ends meet. My Fair Workweek Plan will put power in the hands of part-time workers and help them control their schedules.

It worked. Eventually, everyone got back to eating and talking‚Äîand Aunt Max was never in charge of bringing the turkey again.So no matter what cooking disasters, miscommunications, or accidents happen this Thanksgiving, smile, readjust, and try not to take it too seriously!
An uproar followed as everyone loudly explained that ‚Äúbring the turkey‚Äù meant a cooked turkey. Aunt Max considered that, then laughed. She said we'd eat Thanksgiving dinner in layers‚Äîa Jell-O course, a potato course, a pie course‚Äîfinishing with a turkey course, in about 6 hours.
They burst through the front door, and Uncle Crowbar banged the heavy roaster on the kitchen countertop as people crowded around to see the turkey. With a flourish, Aunt Max lifted the lid, proclaiming, ‚ÄúBiggest Turkey Ever!‚ÄùEveryone jumped back. It was RAW.
My mother fretted and Aunt Alice fumed. The boys buzzed around trying to get a spoonful of this or a crust of that. Aunt Bee tried to keep everything in order. Still no Aunt Max. Then one of the boys spotted her coming up the walk with Uncle Crowbar (that name is another story).
Thanksgiving dinner was set for noon, and most of the family was there by mid-morning. The table was set. The sweet potato casseroles were out of the oven. The pies were on display. The Jell-O molds were out on special plates. Food was piled everywhere. But‚Äîno Aunt Max.
Aunt Max was funny and quick-talking. She never took anything too seriously, including time. And she wasn‚Äôt much of a cook, so the other sisters made sure that she was up to the task‚Äîpeppering her with questions, making sure she'd get a big enough turkey.
Thanksgiving was always a big gathering in our family. The holiday brought in family from Texas, Arkansas, and Kansas. That meant LOTS of planning over who would bring what, how much, and so on.One year, Aunt Max, my mother‚Äôs oldest sister, volunteered to bring the turkey. 
I'm heartsick for Jesus Martinez Manon and his family. We must end this cruelty. No family should live in fear of having their loved ones torn away from them‚Äîon Thanksgiving or any day. When I'm president, we'll build a humane immigration system and treat immigrants with dignity. 
This year, I'm grateful for my family, for the incredible opportunities I've had, for the many wonderful people I‚Äôve met, and for the grassroots movement that is fighting alongside me. From my family to yours: Happy Thanksgiving!
We're so grateful for everyone who does necessary work over the holidays to keep us safe and healthy. But too many giant corporations shamefully choose profits over people by staying open on Thanksgiving. Retail workers deserve to spend time with their loved ones, too. 
I told that if it‚Äôs a fight between money and the power of a grassroots movement, I'm betting on the people. 
This is appalling. Our government has a basic responsibility to protect its citizens from dangerous workplaces‚Äînot bend over backwards to absolve and protect giant corporations. Phillip Lee Terry and his family deserve justice.

Let‚Äôs be clear: It‚Äôs time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. We must be honest about our history, and do what‚Äôs right so that our nation can begin to heal.  
White supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair. Now more than ever, all of us must embrace the lessons of Black history to confront this challenge.  
Racism props up the rich and powerful, leaving them free to take more power for themselves. And the rich and powerful aren‚Äôt going to just give away their power. If we want power, we have to fight for it.  
 Yes, there‚Äôs a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.   
 From the boldness of Atlanta‚Äôs Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.
 Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman‚Äîbacked up by many people across this country‚Äîcan deliver big structural change.
 This isn‚Äôt about whether or not we start a fight. We‚Äôre already in a fight. This is about how we win.
 We all know‚Äîand say‚Äîthe names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let‚Äôs honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.

 Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That‚Äôs why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.

 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.
 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.
 It‚Äôs time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, reparations plan. Time to do what‚Äôs right, so our nation can begin to heal.
 America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.
 And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren‚Äôt going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!
 But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption‚ÄîBlack history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we‚Äôre told to sit down, speak out when we‚Äôre told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.
 The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they‚Äôre afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other‚Äôs fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.
 Divide and conquer is an old political tactic‚Äîand it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It‚Äôs the phobic‚Äîthat‚Äôs the key part. It‚Äôs all about fear. Politics based in fear.
 Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.
 Donald Trump didn‚Äôt create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn‚Äôt be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump‚Äôs embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.
 And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children‚Äôs educations, poor white children got better educations, too.
 When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South‚Äîfor Blacks and whites‚Äîskyrocketed.
 So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people‚Äôs minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of ‚Äúwhat will this mean for me‚Äù?
 To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame ‚Äúthem‚Äù‚Äîpeople who don‚Äôt look like you.
 Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. 
 Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.
 The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.
 In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen‚Äôs strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.
 But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.
 Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens‚Äîthey all backed down. The women won!
 And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: ‚ÄúWe mean business.‚Äù
 Black women‚Äîthen and now‚Äîare no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women‚Äîthen and now‚Äîdon‚Äôt give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.
 The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
 In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.
 One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta‚Äôs Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels‚Äîand formed a union: The Washing Society.
 By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued‚Äîall for less than a dollar a day.
 Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they‚Äôd been forced to do when they had been enslaved‚Äîcaring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
 I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.
 I‚Äôm here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency‚Äîand I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. 
 I wanted to stick around after last night‚Äôs debate because this city has been at the heart of America‚Äôs fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.

We have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That‚Äôs why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change.

Abortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I‚Äôve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does.

When I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day.

 Yesterday released a great new plan for protecting ; empowering tenants including:üí•just cause eviction standard‚Ä¶
I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions‚Äîbut Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. 
 ‚Äú2020 is our time in history. Our time to win the fight for a  and save our planet.‚Äù 
We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I‚Äôll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. 
Ultimately, this is about our values. I‚Äôve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be‚Äîand how the bills can turn people‚Äôs lives upside down. When I‚Äôm president, I‚Äôm going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.
Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid‚Äîall without Congress. 
I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more‚Äîrelieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. 
My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.
First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a  option. That‚Äôs a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage.

Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan‚Äîand I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. 
Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it‚Äîtogether.
Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.
I‚Äôll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.
Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.
Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.
Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.
We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
We‚Äôve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump‚Äôs election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.
But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists‚Äîeven hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.
Mother Emanuel AME Church.Charlottesville.Tree of Life Synagogue.El Paso.Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.
The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists‚Äîand Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: 
Millions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I‚Äôve got a plan to make housing more affordable, protect renters from unjust eviction and discrimination, and invest in healthy and green homes. Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to live. 
The way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win! 
Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to live‚Äîand I'm committed to fighting to protect tenants‚Äô rights. Thank you and for joining me today to discuss my plan to protect and empower renting families!

Black and Brown students are more likely to be punished in school‚Äîand they're more likely to be arrested for minor infractions. Enough is enough. No student should have to learn in an environment where there is a threat of incarceration.  
Doug Manchester is just the tip of the iceberg. Donald Trump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to his rich buddies. It's corruption, plain and simple. I've pledged to end the practice of giving ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors. 
The CFPB protects consumers from Big Banks, Wall Street, and predatory lenders. We need a Tenant Protection Bureau to enforce tenants‚Äô rights, take on bad actors, and make sure landlords keep affordable housing available for working families.
Another blatantly ideological attempt by the Trump administration to distract from its failures in the region. Not only do these settlements violate international law‚Äîthey make peace harder to achieve. As president, I will reverse this policy and pursue a two state solution.

We must ensure that we never have another student debt crisis again. We can do that by recognizing that a public college education is like a public K-12 education ‚Äî a basic public good that should be available to everyone with free tuition and zero debt at graduation.
‚ÄúLess than two weeks after releasing a sweeping student debt cancellation plan, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is promoting a student debt forgiveness calculator designed to show voters exactly how much they would benefit from her plan.‚Äù
The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy, if we are going to build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.

Everyone in America should have a decent, affordable, and safe place to live. We need to tackle our housing crisis head-on‚Äîand I'm ready to fight for the big, structural change renting families need.
My plan to rein in Wall Street will hold private equity firms accountable. And I‚Äôll stop federal dollars from going to predatory landlords and lenders with a history of harassing tenants, forcing tenants to live in dangerous or indecent conditions, or redlining our communities.
Finally, I'll fight exploitation by corporate landlords. Private equity firms have become some of our country‚Äôs biggest landlords‚Äîsnatching up properties, raising rents, evicting tenants, and spending millions lobbying against tenant protection legislation.
We must invest in safe, healthy, and green public housing. I‚Äôll push for investments in new public housing construction. And I‚Äôll fight to close the repair backlog, expand disability accessibility, and for 1:1 replacement of any units that have to be removed or demolished.
Next, we'll tackle skyrocketing rent costs. My administration will stop states from preempting local tenant protection laws, including rent control, by denying access to billions of dollars in federal grants to states who maintain those laws.
I‚Äôll work to secure tenants‚Äô rights nationwide. And I‚Äôll also push to create a new Tenant Protection Bureau‚Äîmodeled after the CFPB‚Äîto enforce tenants‚Äô rights, take on bad actors, and make sure landlords keep affordable housing within reach for working families.
My plan starts with protecting and upholding the rights of tenants. Landlords shouldn‚Äôt be able to arbitrarily push families out of their communities to make an extra buck, or because of thinly-veiled racism and discrimination.
Stagnant wages, sky-rocketing rents, and a stark shortage of affordable options are squeezing America's renting households. Gentrification is displacing communities of color, landlords are exploiting their power over tenants, and Wall Street is snapping up apartment complexes.
My housing plan will invest $500 billion into building, preserving, and restoring more than 3 million units and create 1.5 million jobs. Today, I'm expanding on those efforts with my plan to protect and empower renters. 
My plan to pay for  will cover everyone, cost less, and put $11 trillion back in the pockets of American families. And no family will ever go broke because of health care costs again.

Both Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli have helped Donald Trump enact his cruel immigration agenda. Neither of them should have been promoted. I'll undo the cruel policies they've implemented and fight for humane immigration reform that reflects our values.

Harvoni is described as a "miracle" drug, but it's $94,500-per-treatment price tag leaves 85% of the more than 3 million Americans living with Hepatitis C unable to use it, while taxpayers foot a $3.8 billion bill. 
Truvada‚Äôs manufacturer, Gilead, relied on $50 million in federal grants to develop it, but today they rake in multi-billion dollar profits while Americans struggle to afford it. Only a fraction of patients benefit from it, thanks to its hefty $2,000-a-month price tag. 
Humira is used by millions of patients around the world to treat diseases like arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn‚Äôs disease. But its manufacturer, AbbVie, doubled its price‚Äîand used blatantly anti-competitive behavior to prevent a competitor from entering the market. 
Health officials agree that naloxone is critical to curbing the opioid epidemic, and it can be as cheap as 5¬¢ a dose. But one company spiked the price of their product by over 550% to ‚Äúcapitalize on the opportunity‚Äù of the opioid crisis. 
EpiPens deliver life-saving doses of epinephrine, a drug that reverses severe allergic reactions to things like peanuts and bee stings. In 2016, EpiPens‚Äô manufacturer jacked up prices by 400%, leaving families unable to afford this life-saving medication. 
Insulin was discovered nearly 100 years ago as a treatment for diabetes. But three drug companies dominated the market and jacked up prices. Now, Americans with diabetes are rationing their insulin‚Äîand taxpayers are spending billions on it through Medicare and Medicaid. 
Prescription drug companies' obscene price gouging is leaving patients without access to lifesaving medical treatments. I've got a plan to lower costs on several key drugs that millions rely on. Here are just a few examples.

Billionaires like Blankfein can say whatever they want, but I've spent my career holding big banks accountable and fighting for working families‚Äîand I'm going to keep building a movement to make America work for working families.
One of the billionaires who's so upset with me is Lloyd Blankfein. He ran Goldman Sachs while it misled its own clients in order to turn a profit, which helped create the 2008 crash. His bank then took billions in backdoor taxpayer bailouts, and no one was held accountable.

I‚Äôll fight my heart out at each step of this process, for one simple reason: No one should ever die or go bankrupt because of health care costs. And when I‚Äôm president of the United States, I‚Äôll do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another person again.
Any candidate who believes modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention. So why not dream big and fight hard for the plan that will cover everyone and provide the best care at the lowest cost?
The health care industry spent $4.7 billion over the past decade on lobbying. Let's not kid ourselves‚Äîevery Democratic plan for expanding health care, big or small, is going to be drowned in money to make sure nothing ever happens.
At each step of my plan, millions more Americans will pay lower costs for care and see the quality of their coverage improve. And millions more Americans will be able to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality  plan.
By the end of my third year, I‚Äôll fight to pass legislation to complete the transition to  Once millions have experienced the full benefits of a  option and compared it to the corrupt and wasteful system we have today, the people will demand it.

My plan prevents companies like Exxon from using industry-funded fake research to mislead federal regulators and strike down regulations in court. And if they knowingly lie, we'll treat them the same way the law treats anyone who lies in court‚Äîby prosecuting them for perjury.
Industry players and their allies also knowingly submit false and misleading information to regulatory agencies, giving right-wing judges the chance to later use their junk science as an excuse to invalidate regulations.
Exxon‚Äôs scientists knew that climate change was real decades ago. They could've shared their science with the public. Instead, they and the fossil fuel industry launched a decades-long campaign to cover up the facts and deceive government regulators and the American people.
It‚Äôs illegal to lie to Congress, to a court, and even to your shareholders. It should also be illegal for Exxon and other giant corporations to lie to federal regulators. I've got a plan for that.

The Green New Deal will deploy trillions of dollars to transform the way we source and use energy. In doing so, the government must prioritize resources to support communities on the front lines of the climate crisis, and correct historic injustices. Click to learn more.
We have a crisis of environmental injustice, and it‚Äôs the result of ignoring decades of discrimination and environmental racism in underserved communities. We need big, structural change‚Äîfocused on, and led by, members of these communities. Click to learn more.
Power belongs in the hands of the people. I'm proud to fight alongside for the big, structural change that we need. 
‚Ä¢ Pass a 2¬¢ Ultra-Millionaire Tax‚Ä¢ Provide universal child care and pre-K‚Ä¢ Cancel student debt for 42 mil Americans‚Ä¢ Break up big banks and big techWhen I lead the Democratic Party, we‚Äôll fight for these big, structural changes. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.
The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy, if we are going to build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.
Thank you, I'm proud to be fighting alongside you to put power in the hands of the people. 
No student should have to learn in an environment where there's a threat of incarceration. I've got plans to close the school to prison pipeline and ensure every student has a safe and welcoming place to learn. 
Insurance companies make their profit by refusing coverage. We need  because no one‚Äôs health care should depend on whether they can shame an insurance company. 
Congratulations to on winning re-election! I admire your dedication to the people of your district, and am inspired by your commitment to making infrastructure a priority in Virginia.

Congratulations to on her historic election as the first Latina and first woman mayor of Tucson, Arizona! Regina is a champion for our environment and working families‚Äîand I'm looking forward to the big, structural change she'll bring to her community.
I‚Äôm glad to see win her seat in the House of Delegates. She will be a real fighter for working families in coastal Virginia‚Äîand there‚Äôs no need for a hat draw when the people of Virginia vote and make their voices heard! 
Woo-hoo! Congratulations to the people of Virginia for flipping both the state House and state Senate. Voting is what our democracy is all about, and Virginia proved that today as they elected up and down the ballot.  
Iran‚Äôs decision to restart enrichment at Fordow is deeply concerning. Before Donald Trump ripped it up, the Iran Deal was working. We must return to serious diplomacy with allies to constrain Iran‚Äôs nuclear program and de-escalate the crisis. 
Congratulations on winning your re-election! Manchester needs a mayor who is fighting for working people, and Joyce will keep fighting to make sure they can succeed.

I was proud to endorse for Philadelphia City Council, and together, she and have built a movement that is putting power in the hands of the people. Philadelphia, get out and vote‚Äîif you‚Äôre in line by 8 PM, you will be able to vote!
Thank you, The only way we're going to end this climate crisis is with big, structural change. 
Mental health care is a human right. I stand with represented clinicians who are going on strike across California to demand that ensure patients get the mental health care they need.
 ‚ÄòIf we're going to meet the challenges of our time, we need big ideas‚Äô ‚Äî to Iowa Democrats 
The fact that they've reacted so strongly‚Äîso angrily!‚Äîto being asked to chip in more tells you all you need to know. The system is working great for the wealthy and well-connected, and Jamie Dimon doesn't want that to change. I'm going to fight to make sure it works for everyone.
It's really simple: Jamie Dimon and his buddies are successful in part because of the opportunities, workforce, and public services that we all paid for. It's only fair that he and his billionaire friends chip in to make sure everyone else has a chance to succeed. 
It turns out if you're a giant corporation with millions to spend misleading people on your record of accelerating the climate crisis, that's exactly what you can‚Äîand probably will‚Äîdo. 
Twitter's new ad policy will allow fossil fuel companies to buy ads defending themselves and spreading misleading info‚Äîbut won't allow organizations fighting the climate crisis to buy ads holding those companies accountable. We need accountability. 
All three of my brothers served, so I understand the responsibility we have to honor our promises to our service members and veterans. I've got a plan to invest in the VA‚Äînot privatize it.

 While my opponent is trying to eliminate the Public Advocate's office, knows it's so critical that she's prop‚Ä¶
My plan to protect our democracy directly targets this type of racist voting suppression. We will have federal standards to ensure everyone can vote‚Äîand where racist or corrupt politicians refuse to follow the law, the federal government will step in. 
This isn't just an inconvenience‚Äîlong lines and delays prevent people from voting, and it isn't a surprise or secret that racist and corrupt politicians have allowed these problems to suppress the vote in minority communities. 
It's simple:  is the best way to ensure that everyone gets the care they need and that no one ever goes broke because of health care costs. 
By leaving the Paris Climate Agreement, Trump is ceding American leadership and giving away American jobs in the clean energy economy of the future. We should be leading the fight to end the climate crisis‚Äîand I've got a plan for that. 
Albuquerque, you've got a chance to vote for an innovative way to move beyond the influence of big money in politics.  and show that bold reforms work‚Äîand build momentum for big, structural change!
As Commander-in-Chief, I will lead our armed forces with awareness of the unique challenges service members, veterans, and military families face. I‚Äôll honor our troops by not only executing sound military strategy, but also caring for them after they take off the uniform.
Finally, my administration will invest in the VA and reject attempts to privatize it. Under  veterans will also have the option to get high-quality health care from non-VA doctors and hospitals at no additional cost.
My administration will ease the transition of veterans leaving military service and help prepare them to return to civilian life. We‚Äôll create a seamless transition from the DOD to the VA, eliminate the benefits backlog, and expand career opportunities for our vets.
A Warren administration will protect the rights of LGBTQ+, women, Black, and Latinx service members. I'll reverse Trump's shameful ban on trans service members on Day One. My administration will protect veterans and family members of serving military personnel from deportation.
We must ensure the safety of those who serve or have served in uniform. I'll fight to eliminate military sexual assault, expand mental health services and work to end military and veteran suicide, and treat the opioid and addiction crisis.
Military families are the backbone of our armed forces, but they face unique challenges. I'll prioritize military spouse employment, ensure families have high-quality child care and education, provide safe and affordable housing, and protect wounded warriors and their caregivers.
Our all-volunteer military has struggled to attract and retain sufficient personnel. A Warren administration will preserve best-in-class benefits for military personnel, and ensure we honor our commitments to those who have served.
We can honor our veterans by ending endless wars, reining in our bloated defense budget and reducing the influence of defense contractors at the Pentagon, and bringing our troops home responsibly‚Äîand then providing our veterans with the benefits they‚Äôve earned.
This starts with care in how we deploy our forces. Decades of wars have sapped our strength, and the burden has fallen primarily on military personnel and their families. It's not fair to ask them to solve problems that don‚Äôt have a military solution.
All three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has towards military personnel and their families. Today, I'm sharing my plan to honor our promises to our nation‚Äôs veterans, service members, military families, and survivors. 
Happy  to all the states holding elections! Today‚Äôs our chance to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. Find your polling place at  and head to the polls to make your voice heard‚Äîmake sure to bring your friends and family!
Our democracy shouldn‚Äôt be bought and paid for by the wealthy and powerful. I stand with Seattle council members, activists, and voters who are standing up to Amazon. It's time to get big money out of politics. 
I'm not afraid to fight for the big, structural change we need. Thank you, Grinnell, for being a part of this fight for big ideas! 
I‚Äôm grateful for every grassroots donor who keeps our people-powered campaign going. We‚Äôre ramping up for the next phase of this campaign‚Äîall the way to Iowa‚Äîand it‚Äôs going to take real resources. Will you chip in now to help keep up the momentum? 
We need to be strengthening our response to climate change‚Äîbut Trump and his administration are running away from our responsibilities. I'll move to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of my presidency. 
Facebook can rebrand all they want but they can‚Äôt hide the fact that they are too big and powerful. It‚Äôs time to  
I care about an entire generation of students being crushed by student loan debt‚Äîdeferring their American dream because they can't afford it. I care about making sure every American has the opportunity to succeed. I'm not afraid to stand up to the wealthy and well-connected.
One thing I know he cares about‚Äîhis fortune. He's a shareholder in Navient, a student loan company that has cheated borrowers and used abusive, misleading tactics. He even went so far as to ask how I might impact his investment in the last earnings call with Navient. 
37 million people didn‚Äôt fill a prescription last year.36 million people skipped a recommended test or treatment.40 million people didn‚Äôt go to a doctor to check on a health issue.Even with insurance, costs keep people from getting the care they need. We need 
The Trump administration's expanded global gag rule has had catastrophic affects worldwide, leaving millions without access to safe reproductive health care. When I'm president, I'll overturn the global gag rule and protect reproductive health care. 
No one should avoid seeing a doctor because they don‚Äôt have insurance‚Äîor because the cost, even with insurance, is too high. This is why we need  
Wall Street is scared because the status quo is working great for them‚Äîbut we know it's not working so great for everyone else. I'm not afraid to fight for a country where everyone can succeed, not just the wealthy and well-connected. 
It shouldn't take a federal court to see Trump's tax returns. I've got a plan to require presidential candidates to release at least eight years of their tax returns‚Äîso voters can hold candidates accountable. 
The stories you send me about health care‚Äîunaffordable treatments, horrifying debt‚Äîbreak my heart. I‚Äôm fighting for you all. If you have a story about health care and what  would mean for you, I want to hear it:  
I'm so glad my friend could join me in Davenport today. Together, we're going to build the movement that will defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot! 
2020 is our moment in history‚Äîour moment to dream big, fight hard, and win!  
I did my homework, and I got the experts to check my math. My plan to pay for  will ensure everyone has full health coverage and put $11 trillion back in the pockets of American families. Here's how. 
We've got exactly one year left to build the movement that will defeat Donald Trump and elect a wave of Democrats up and down the ticket.If you're ready to fight for big, structural change, sign up to volunteer.  
No more GoFundMe campaigns to pay for health care. No more going bankrupt because of health care costs.No more skipping treatments because of costs.No more rationing insulin. No more choosing between medicine and groceries.We need 
Insurance companies make absurd arguments like this because they make their profit by denying people care. No for-profit insurance company should be able to stop anyone from getting the treatment they need. That's why we need  
Health care and economics experts took a look at my plan to pay for  and agreed‚Äîwe can cover everyone, give them better coverage, reduce costs, and return $11 trillion to American families.
No premiums. No copays. No deductibles. My plan to pay for  will return $11 trillion to American families. Use my calculator to find out what  would mean for you:

Washington is working great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not so great for everyone else. It won't be enough to just nibble around the edges. If we want to root out Washington corruption, we need big, structural change.

We win when we offer solutions big enough to touch the problems that are in people‚Äôs lives. Fear and complacency does not win elections‚Äîhope and courage wins elections.  
Anyone who tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory.  
The time for small ideas is over. We need big ideas to solve the challenges we face‚Äîand we need someone willing to fight for them.  
Millions of Americans across this country already know deep down in their bones that our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful. That's corruption, plain and simple. It's time for big, structural change.  
We win elections when we have solutions that are big enough to meet the challenges that people face in their lives. Because fear and complacency don‚Äôt win elections; hope and courage do. 
When you give up the fight on a big idea, you‚Äôre giving up on the people whose lives it would touch. Those fights are all of our fights. And anyone who tells you to dream small and give up early is not the person who will lead us to victory. 
We need big ideas that can fix the challenges we face, that can inspire people, that bring people out to vote. But most importantly, we need someone willing to fight for those big ideas. 
What do toasters and bad mortgages have in common? Both could cost you your home. A government agency stepped in to stop people from selling toasters that could set your house on fire. I had an idea for a government agency to protect consumers from bad mortgages‚Äîthe CFPB. 
Some people are afraid of big, structural change. The wealthy and well-connected are afraid of losing their influence. Some have just become so cynical or beaten down that they don‚Äôt think real change is possible.Well, I'm not afraid‚Äîand I know we can get it done. 
I‚Äôm here to talk about something that people all across Iowa and all across America already know deep down in their bones: Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and the powerful. We need big, structural change‚Äîand that change starts right here in Iowa. 
In a few minutes, I'll be live at the  dinner talking with Iowans about the big, structural change we're fighting for. I hope you'll tune in!

I did the homework. I got the experts to check my math, and the numbers are clear:  is the only plan that gives everyone in America full coverage. And we can do it without raising taxes one penny on middle-class families. 
A clear majority of voters support my plan for  and a Democrat who supports  easily beats Donald Trump. Fighting for  is the right thing to do‚Äîand when we dream big and fight hard, we win. 
I just released my plan to pay for  It puts $11 trillion back in the pockets of American families, and doesn‚Äôt raise taxes on the middle class by even a cent. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to get it done: 
We wouldn't have gotten this far in the fight for  without courageous activists like you, speaking out and putting it all on the line. Let's keep fighting‚Äîand together, we'll win. 
The Trump administration has pushed construction of the Keystone XL pipeline despite the known environmental and public health risks. North Dakotans deserve better than this. We need clean energy to protect our public lands and waters. 
Under my  plan, corporations and the wealthiest 1% will pay their fair share ‚Äî and taxes for the middle class won‚Äôt go up a cent. Instead, we‚Äôll return a whopping $11 trillion to the American people. That‚Äôs bigger than the biggest tax cut in our history. Sign on.

We can pay for  without raising taxes one penny on middle-class families. Use my new calculator to find out what my plan to pay for Medicare for All will mean for you:  
In addition to providing coverage for everyone, they concluded that my plan would slightly reduce the amount of money that the United States would otherwise spend on health care over the next 10 years.
This analysis was led by Dr. Donald Berwick, one of the nation's top experts in health care improvement who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President Obama; and Simon Johnson, the former Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at MIT.
I asked top experts to examine my  plan, and they concluded we can cover everyone and give them vastly better coverage‚Äîwithout a tax increase on middle-class families. 
Health care costs have devastated American families for too long. Under my  plan, costs like premiums, deductibles, and copays go to basically $0. Health care is a human right, and I‚Äôve got a plan to make sure it‚Äôs treated like one. Sign up today if you‚Äôre with me.

I am fighting for  I have the only detailed plan to pay for it. And we are the only Democratic primary campaign that has laid out the true, full costs of any health care plan, Medicare for All or otherwise. I look forward to others doing the same.
Achieving  isn‚Äôt going to be easy, but I‚Äôm in this race to fight for American families. In the coming weeks, I will also release a transition plan‚Äîand I will start lowering health care costs and increasing coverage as soon as I‚Äôm sworn in as president.
We cover the remaining $11 trillion largely with taxes on big corporations, Wall Street, and the top 1%‚Äîand enforcing the tax laws we have now. Add in a targeted cut to a Defense Dept slush fund and that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôll find full details in my plan here: 
To cover the cost, we start by taking the money that employers are currently paying in the form of premiums to private insurance companies and have them pay it to Medicare instead.
How is it paid for? Well, if you‚Äôre not in the top 1%, Wall Street, or a big corporation‚Äîcongratulations, you don‚Äôt pay a penny more and you‚Äôre fully covered by 
Instead, we‚Äôre going to spend more on care itself. And thanks to getting rid of all the waste in the system, we can offer top-of-the-line care for all 331 million people in the U.S. for LESS than what we‚Äôll pay if we do nothing to fix our broken system now.
Let‚Äôs get to the math! (All backed up by independent experts and economists.) First, we‚Äôre going to rein in the waste, inefficiency, and corporate profiteering by insurance and drug companies. And we‚Äôll bring down out-of-control costs.
My  plan would end the stranglehold of health costs on American families. It would return a whopping $11 trillion to families who will never pay another premium or medical bill. It would be one of the greatest federal expansions of middle-class wealth in history.
 finally brings true choice to the health care system. The choice to see the doctor you want, to get the prescriptions you need, pick the job or start that small business you want without worrying about where your health insurance will come from.
The best plan is  only plan that gives everyone in America full coverage, with the freedom to see any doctor, with no premiums, copays, and deductibles‚Äîso getting sick doesn‚Äôt mean you go broke. No restrictions, no surprises, no more bills.
Health care costs are rising and crushing families. And a serious diagnosis can financially ruin a middle-class family even if they have insurance. We let private insurance and drug companies profit from that pain. Enough. We need a system that reflects our values.
Today, I‚Äôm releasing my plan to pay for  Here‚Äôs the headline: My plan won't raise taxes one penny on middle-class families. In fact, we'll return about $11 TRILLION to the American people. That's bigger than the biggest tax cut in our history. Here's how:
Donald Trump doesn't want the state of New York to see his taxes‚ÄîI wonder why. Let's call this out for what it is: Corruption, plain and simple. Under my anti-corruption plan, all presidential candidates would be required to release their tax returns.

The House has been diligently gathering evidence on Trump's many crimes, and now it's time for the impeachment inquiry to move forward. Today's vote was not about politics‚Äîit was about principle. No one is above the law, not even the president.

Industrial pollution has been disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities and communities of color like in Louisiana's Cancer Alley. We need to be reducing harmful emissions‚Äînot permitting more. These communities need environmental justice. 
I love when math teachers take a look at my plans‚Äîthe math checks out! 
 Thanks for being in this fight for big, structural change, We‚Äôre going to do this together.
A person's wealth shouldn't determine the amount of time they can spend with me‚Äîor any other presidential candidate.That‚Äôs why our campaign is funded with small dollar donations. Will you chip in $3 now before our October fundraising deadline? 
Thanks, Calling grassroots donors is one of my favorite things to do‚Äîyou're going to love it.

Rising sea levels will be catastrophic for coastal cities. Our climate is in crisis and the time to act is now. 
I applaud my colleagues in the House for passing a resolution acknowledging and condemning the Armenian genocide. If we don‚Äôt recognize the horrors of the past, we risk repeating them in the future. We must honor the victims and pledge: Never again. 
Uber, Lyft, and Doordash are prepared to spend millions pushing a ballot measure to undermine California's new protections for gig workers. We should all fight these companies' attempts to wield their wealth to block protections for their workers. 
I‚Äôm so grateful to have you on  Together, we‚Äôll make the big, structural change our country needs. 
I‚Äôm proud to be fighting alongside for criminal justice reform and an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected.

Giant corporations shouldn't be able to rig the system by scooping up government officials to get favorable treatment. So I'll ban them from hiring senior government officials for at least four years after they leave office. And if they break these rules, they'll have to pay up. 
I gave up on not offending big donors and giant corporations a long time ago‚Äîbecause when we have big ideas, we get out there and fight for them.I'm not afraid, and for Democrats to win in 2020, you can't be afraid, either. That‚Äôs how we'll make real change. 
Person by person, community by community, we're building a grassroots movement to make our government work for the people.But I can‚Äôt do it alone. Chip in $3 and join the fight‚Äîand I might call you to say thanks! 
Communities are tired of seeing families torn apart and immigrants and asylum seekers detained‚Äîand they're speaking out. It's time to end unnecessary detention. 
This is a good start. Now it's time to allow them to join a union‚Äîand get paid. 
GM, Toyota, and Fiat should know better than this. The American auto industry should be leading the way to reduce emissions, not siding with the Trump administration to further pollute our communities. 
We have to break the political influence of giant corporations and federal contractors on our government. I‚Äôve got a plan for that.  
Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify. It's time to end these arbitrary, undemocratic voter purges. 
It's time to put power in the hands of working people‚Äînot just a select wealthy few.That's why our campaign is people-funded: No fancy fundraisers, no PACs, and no special interest groups.Chip in $3 right now to own a piece of this campaign. 
This is corruption, plain and simple‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan to end it.  
The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy, if we are going to build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.
‚Ä¢ Pass a 2¬¢ Ultra-Millionaire Tax‚Ä¢ Provide universal child care and pre-K‚Ä¢ Cancel student debt for 42 mil Americans‚Ä¢ Break up big banks and big techWhen I lead the Democratic Party, we‚Äôll fight for these big, structural changes. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.
This proposal comes from, of all places, a commission meant to improve our democracy. But attacking the is deeply undemocratic‚Äîand it will only benefit Republicans. No Democrat should allow this to pass.

Executives have made it clear they're ready to ‚Äúgo to the mat‚Äù to fight, but that‚Äôs not how our economy or our democracy is supposed to work. Together, we‚Äôll close the revolving door and break the grip of giant corporations on our economy and our government.
If giant corporations violate these rules, they will have to pay up: 1% of net profits for the first violation, 2% for the second, and 5% for any subsequent violation. For a company like Facebook, that could mean over $1 billion.
Giant corporations shouldn't be able to rig the system by scooping up government officials to get favorable treatment. I'll ban giant federal contractors, banks, and market-dominant companies from hiring senior government officials for at least four years after they leave office.
It's not just Facebook. Giant corporations regularly hire people from their government regulators to leverage their connections and use the allure of future jobs to get favorable treatment. It‚Äôs no wonder these companies have consolidated power without any real accountability.
Facebook is now spending millions on lobbying amid antitrust scrutiny‚Äîand Kaplan is flexing his DC rolodex to help Mark Zuckerbeg wage a closed-door charm offensive with Republican lawmakers.
Two years after serving as George W. Bush‚Äôs Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Joel Kaplan was hired by Facebook as its Vice President for US Public Policy. Since he was hired, Facebook spent over $71 million on lobbying‚Äînearly 100 times what it had spent before Kaplan joined.
Giant market-dominant companies like Facebook, Pfizer, and Comcast strategically hire senior government officials who can leverage their contacts for corporate gain. If we want to root out Washington corruption, that must end‚Äîand I've got a plan. 
I'm not taking a dime from federal lobbyists, corporate PACs, or PACs of any kind‚Äîbecause our campaign is powered by the people, not special interest groups with Big Money to spend.Chip in now and I might just call with a big ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù 
I'm grateful down to my toes for your support, Looking forward to the day doesn't have to fight with the president of the United States on Twitter. 
Good. Now it's time to end all ICE contracts with private detention providers. No one should profit off of our inhumane immigration policies. 
Facebook's own employees know just how dangerous their policy allowing politicians to lie in political ads will be for our democracy. Mark Zuckerberg should listen to them‚Äîand I applaud their brave efforts to hold their own company accountable. 
I've been a teacher, a law professor, a senator, and a candidate for president of the United States thanks to the opportunities a public education gave me. Today's your last chance to get our free sticker to show you're

Senator Kay Hagan was a tireless fighter for women, veterans, and military families, and a dear friend and colleague. I'm heartsick for Kay's family and friends. 
Frances Perkins saw what was broken in our country and had a plan to fix it. One woman‚Äîbacked by millions of people‚Äîwas able to make big, structural change. And we can do it again in 2020. 
John Conyers fought to make our government work for Black Americans as a civil rights leader and co-founder of that important work continues to inspire us. I‚Äôm keeping him and his loved ones in my thoughts.
Our students shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about where they‚Äôll get their next meal. Under my public school plan, we‚Äôll cancel student breakfast and lunch debt and provide free and nutritious school meals so our kids can succeed in school. 
When someone is sent into our criminal justice system, it's not a single person. When a person is arrested, we have to think about how that pulls their entire family into the system‚Äîand how that family is treated. 
Thank you students for asking important questions at the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum. We can start to fix our criminal justice system by investing not in incarceration, but in services that lift communities up. My plan for that:  
I‚Äôm deeply grateful to the community of Bethel AME Church in Columbia, South Carolina for their warm welcome this morning. 
I stood shoulder-to-shoulder with and because I believe in America‚Äôs public school teachers. We need to invest in our public schools‚Äîand I have a plan to do just that:  
When workers organize and fight back, they win. 
Thank you, Florence! Shoulder to shoulder, I believe we can dream big, fight hard, and win. 
(2/2) Baghdadi's death closes one chapter, but it is not the end of our fight against terrorism. We need a settlement that ends the suffering and destruction in Syria‚Äîand ultimately, a long-term plan to counter extremism and allow the region to achieve peace and stability.
(1/2) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi led a campaign of mass violence and terror that devastated the region and threatened the world. His death is a setback for ISIS and a victory for justice. I am grateful for the skill and courage of our special operations and intelligence professionals.
Happy Diwali! Bruce and I wish all who celebrate a joyous holiday. 
One year ago today, eleven people were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue. They were observing Shabbat at a place that should have been a sanctuary. We have to end gun violence‚Äîand we have to speak up against hate, bigotry, and antisemitism.

I‚Äôve loved hearing your  stories. If we dream big and fight hard, my administration will work to ensure that every kid in America has a great public school education.Get your free sticker if you haven‚Äôt already:  
Between town halls last week, I took some time to read a letter I got from Katie, a teacher in North Carolina. Katie wrote in with her story‚Äîso I called her to say thanks for being in the fight. My new public school plan would help Katie and her students:  
When I‚Äôm president, my administration will protect the rights of gig workers to unionize‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan for that. 
I stand with Uber drivers who will make their voices heard on November 6. This is a crucial moment in the fight for workers‚Äô rights in America.

Amado works hard and volunteers with He deserves affordable housing‚Äîwith sunlight. I'll fight to ensure that everyone has safe, affordable housing. And I'll fight for immigrant communities and protect their rights. 
Intersex people must have a say in decisions that affect their bodies. As president, I'll fight for the rights of intersex people and protect them from discrimination, especially when it comes to their health care.  
Climate change is driving devastating wildfires across California‚Äîand these fires will only grow more dangerous and destructive until we act to stop the climate crisis. 
This is appalling. ICE needs to be held accountable for Roxsana Hern√°ndez's death, and for destroying evidence related to her death. 
It was delicious. 
And those are just a few examples of Trump‚Äôs corruption. This administration is the most corrupt of our lifetime. It‚Äôs time to root out Washington corruption‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan for that. 
The corruption goes a lot deeper than one hotel. Foreign governments funnel money into Trump's pockets from many of his hotels and properties. He appoints Mar-a-Lago members as our ambassadors. He tried to host the G-7 summit at his Doral property. 
Voting should be easy‚Äîbut many states make it hard for people to vote. I‚Äôm grateful for  and college students everywhere fighting to make their voices heard. 
Teachers deserve the pay and resources they need to do their jobs well.I stand with Dedham public school teachers‚Äîand I'll strengthen the ability of teachers and school staff to organize and bargain collectively.
Thank you, Newport! If we dream big and fight hard, then together, we can win. 
Seeing leadership in Florida gives me hope. Nikki has proven to Floridians the difference it makes when we elect Democrats and elevate women up and down the ticket. 
Good. Betsy DeVos needs to be held accountable‚Äîand we need a secretary of education willing to fight for students.

Thank you to everyone who came to yesterday's Dartmouth College Town Hall. I'm grateful to everyone in this fight‚Äîand everyone who stuck around for a photo! Bruce and Bailey enjoyed meeting you, too. 
We lost my friend Senator Paul Wellstone nearly two decades ago today‚Äîbut we're still continuing his fight to make sure that the government works for all of us, not just the big banks, giant corporations, and the wealthy and well-connected.
The Democratic primary should belong to grassroots supporters and grassroots donors, not the rich and powerful.Every Democratic candidate should agree: Super PACs have no place in our primary. 
It‚Äôs disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats.A handful of wealthy donors should not be allowed to buy the Democratic nomination. That's not who we are.
Wall Street, billionaires, and corporations are gearing up to start Super PACs for candidates who they think will maintain the status quo. Those special interests are ready to spend ridiculous amounts of money in the primary against us. Chip in today to help us fight back.

We should fight back against measures that criminalize homelessness‚Äînot propose ones that will only perpetuate it. I'll fight to make sure those experiencing homelessness get affordable housing and access to the services they need.

I rang the alarm before the 2008 economic collapse, and I‚Äôm seeing serious warning signs again‚Äîbut we‚Äôve still got time to stop it. And I‚Äôve got a plan for that:  
I‚Äôm glad someone from the Trump administration figured out that our student loan debt crisis is crushing an entire generation.Republican, independent, or Democrat‚Äîmy plan to cancel student loan debt is a win for our economy and all of our students.

I'll move to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of my presidency. We need to strengthen our response to the climate crisis, not run away from it.America is at its best when we dream big and fight hard, and we must fight hard to defeat the climate crisis together.
American diplomacy was critical in bringing the world together to adopt the Paris Climate Agreement and commit to fighting climate change. Pulling the U.S. out of this deal threatens our security and economy‚Äîand our ability to fight climate change. 
U.S. weapons may have ended up in the hands of al Qaeda-linked fighters and separatist militias in Yemen, undermining our national security and worsening the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.I'm demanding answers. 
Far too many families have lost loved ones because of inadequate or negligent care. We need to end unnecessary detention, ensure those in custody receive medical care, and end contracts with private detention providers.

Leon, you were able to succeed because of the opportunities this country gave you. Now why don‚Äôt you pitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream, too? 
Communities of color on the front lines of the climate crisis have faced generations of industrial pollution. Their voices must be centered in the fight against climate change‚Äîand the fight for environmental justice. 
Trump's unqualified Mar-a-Lago member-ambassadors are undermining our diplomats and damaging our reputation abroad. It's time to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to political cronies and wealthy donors.

Everyone deserves equal pay for equal work. It's time to end the subminimum wage for people with disabilities. I'll fight for free vocational training to help people with disabilities get good-paying jobs. 
I'm not afraid to fight for big, structural change‚Äîand neither are the people of Cedar Falls. Thanks for being part of this grassroots movement! 
Let‚Äôs be clear: Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional right. Every time we deny access to safe, legal abortion, we put lives in danger. I‚Äôve got a plan to protect our reproductive health care in every state.  
Our farmers face the impacts of climate change every day, from blistering heat waves to record flooding.The USDA owes them the truth‚Äîand the Trump administration must stop burying its head in the sand. The climate crisis will only get worse until we act.

I'll say it again: This is corruption, plain and simple. Donald Trump must be impeached. 
Parents would do anything to ensure their children have a fair shot in life‚Äîand I want to help. That's why I've got a plan to make sure every kid can get a high-quality public education that sets them up for success. 
Our public schools are more segregated today than they were thirty years ago. I'll renew the fight against segregation by helping integrate our communities‚Äîand by strengthening and robustly enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
A new bulletproof memorial marking Emmett Till‚Äôs brutal lynching was installed this week after multiple markers were previously stolen, vandalized, and shot. Racist attacks are not just a part of our history‚Äîthey are a part of our present, too.

Lynching is a horrific stain on our country's history, and it is beyond disgraceful for Donald Trump to invoke one to avoid being held accountable for his crimes.Nobody is above the law, not even the president of the United States.
It‚Äôs time to live up to our promise of providing every student with a great public education. 
Climate change is an existential threat‚Äîand it's time for companies to reveal their emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. My Climate Risk Disclosure Act will require companies to publicly disclose their role in contributing to the climate crisis. 
Thank you, Ames! Together we'll dream big, fight hard, and build the grassroots movement we need to win. 
Betsy DeVos refers to public schools as a "dead end."I believe in public schools, and I'll fight for them with everything I‚Äôve got.  
Talking with grassroots donors is my favorite part of the day. Whether you can give a lot or a little, everyone owns a piece of our democracy. Will you chip in to our grassroots campaign next? I might just call you to say thanks!
I want to make sure that every kid in America can get a high-quality public education. Thanks to the students at Roosevelt High School for our conversation about how we can improve our public schools!

It's time to live up to the promise of a high-quality public education for every student. My plan makes big, structural changes that would help give every student the resources that they need to thrive.
We must stop the privatization of public schools. My administration will end federal funding for the expansion of charter schools, ban for-profit charter schools, and ensure existing charter schools are held to the same level of transparency and accountability as public schools.
My administration will work with states to sustainably increase the pay of teachers, paraprofessionals, school staff, and school leaders, and ensure that they have the resources they need. And I'll strengthen their ability to organize and bargain collectively.
I will also push to cancel all existing student meal debt and increase federal funding to school meal programs so that students everywhere can get free and nutritious school meals.
I'll ensure that every student has the opportunity to learn in a welcoming and safe public school. That's why my administration will eliminate high-stakes testing, invest in evidenced-based school safety, and end zero-tolerance discipline policies.
My administration will also protect the rights of students with disabilities, LGBTQ+ students, English Language Learners, and immigrant students and their families so that every kid has access to a high-quality public education.
Integrated schools improve educational outcomes for students of all races. And integrated schools are demanded by our Constitution. My administration will fund integration efforts, strengthen Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and robustly enforce it.
And we'll provide more funding for IDEA grants, repairing and improving school facilities and infrastructure, developing sustainable community schools, and providing grants to public schools for the programs and resources that are most important to their students.
Next, I'll make sure that we fund schools adequately and equitably by quadrupling Title I funding‚Äîinvesting an additional $450 billion over the next 10 years‚Äîand working with public education leaders and school finance experts to ensure that this money is allocated equitably.
I‚Äôll start‚Äîas I promised in May‚Äîby replacing Betsy DeVos with a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher, believes in public education, and will listen to our public school teachers, parents, and students.
Funding for public schools is inadequate and inequitable, and our schools are more segregated now than decades ago. We don't treat teachers and staff like professionals, and we're diverting money from public schools. It's time to live up to our promise of a good public education.

 Keep fighting, Brandon. The work you are doing is so important, and I‚Äôll fight alongside you.
 Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me, Rebecca! Stay strong out there.
It's simple: Corporate profits are soaring, but workers' salaries are barely budging. I'll strengthen the rights of workers to strike‚Äîbecause we should all see the benefits of a strong economy. 
Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh‚Äîwe must call it out, and I have a plan to fight back: 
The G-7 may no longer be at Trump National Doral, but that won‚Äôt stop foreign nations from dumping money into Donald Trump's pockets by spending at his hotels. And it won‚Äôt stop Trump from rewarding Mar-a-Lago members with ambassadorships. 
We don't need fancy fundraisers, corporate PACs, or federal lobbyists to win in 2020‚Äîwe just need this grassroots movement.Will you chip in $3 now to help keep up the momentum? We have a lot planned for the next few months, and I can‚Äôt do this alone. 
Communities on the front lines of the climate crisis have already faced industrial pollution, devastating floods, ruined lands, and poisoned water.Justice cannot be an afterthought in our fight against climate change‚Äîit must be central to our fight.

Trans migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable.We must end unnecessary detention and enforce strict standards to keep trans migrants and asylum seekers safe‚Äîand I'll continue holding our government accountable when they fail to do so. 
We have to protect Black trans women‚Äîand we have to fight gun violence. I'm heartsick for Brianna Hill and her friends and family. 
Abusing diplomatic relationships for personal, political gain.Appointing Mar-a-Lago members as our ambassadors.Hosting the G-7 Summit at one of his properties.The Trump administration is the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes.
If we want to make big, structural change, that starts with electing more women up and down the ballot. I'm committed to building the future of our party and helping Democrats keep the House, flip the Senate, and regain ground in key state legislatures in 2020. 
The CFPB was created because we needed an agency dedicated to protecting consumers and holding big banks accountable. Big banks haven't stopped trying to kill it since‚Äîbut I'll never stop fighting. We need Washington to work for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected.
Big banks and their Republican allies have been trying to kill the CFPB for years, and the Trump administration is hoping the right-wing, pro-corporate Supreme Court will help. I've got news for them: Like it or not, the CFPB is constitutional. 
Seven hours. Roberto Rodriguez-Espinoza might still be alive if he had been immediately sent to a hospital. His death is a disgrace. We have to ensure that all migrants and asylum seekers receive adequate, prompt medical care. 
Sallie Mae is squeezing student loan borrowers for profit while sending their employees on lavish vacations. It‚Äôs time to cancel student loan debt.

We've got to get big money out of politics and put power in the hands of the people. My plan for campaign finance reform will establish a public financing program that would give a 6-1 match for small dollar donations‚Äîmaking it more valuable to spend time with ordinary voters!

Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again‚Äîand profit off of it.
Here's the thing, Mark. Trump isn't just posting a lie on his own page for his own followers. Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies. Ads that TV stations won't even run.
Facebook had a policy that didn't permit misinformation in any ads. Facebook built relationships with independent fact-checkers, so they weren't the sole deciders of what was or wasn't a lie. But Facebook undermined those relationships and excluded political ads from that policy.
Mark Zuckerberg's speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election. 
Rick Perry put his fossil fuel buddies above protecting our planet from climate change and his political loyalties above our country and the law. I'm glad he's out as Secretary of Energy, but we can‚Äôt stop holding him accountable.

The was an example of dreaming big and fighting hard. People told me, go for something little. Go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. I said no. Let's go for an agency that will make big, structural change in our economy. 
After the financial crisis, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would stop banks from cheating people. Republicans, big banks, even Democrats told me: You‚Äôll never get it passed. But I fought hard. To date, the has returned $12 billion to American consumers. 
We need to address the elephant in the room: How campaigns are financed. Today, I announced that I‚Äôm not taking any money from Big Pharma, Big Tech, or Wall Street executives. You can‚Äôt go behind closed doors, take their money and then expect them to enforce the rules.

We‚Äôre all looking forward to strengthening America's middle class. It‚Äôs why I have a new plan for expanding Social Security‚Äîstarting with an extra $200 a month that will lift millions of seniors out of poverty.  
We‚Äôve had a lot of problems losing jobs. The reason is bad trade policy and giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to American workers. They‚Äôre only loyal to their own bottom line. I have a plan to fix that.  
I spent most of my career studying one question: Why do hardworking people go broke? One of the major causes is the cost of health care. The problem we‚Äôve got right now is the overall cost of health care. We must stop Americans from going bankrupt from health care. 
Let‚Äôs be clear: Whenever someone hears the term ‚ÄúMedicare for all who want it,‚Äù it really means ‚ÄúMedicare for all who can afford it.‚Äù  is the gold standard‚Äîthat‚Äôs how we make sure everyone gets health care. 
I have made clear what my principles are on  Costs will go up for the wealthy and big corporations, and for hardworking middle class families, costs will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.

This is about more than just one phone call. It‚Äôs about a concerted effort by Donald Trump and those around him to abuse our diplomatic relationships for his personal political gain. He must be impeached‚Äîand everyone involved must be held accountable.

I'll prohibit campaign donations and political spending from being a consideration in the selection of an ambassador. I'll also ban corporations and lobbyists from donating to inaugural committees and place contribution limits on donations. Read more here: 
Trump may think a big campaign check qualifies someone to represent our country abroad‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt. I've pledged to not participate in the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors. And my new plan to get big money out of politics goes further.
Lynda Blanchard, David Melech Friedman, Robert Kohorst, John Rakolta, Carla Sands, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Jamie McCourt, and George Glass became ambassadors after they, or their associates, gave a combined $1.63 million.
Don Tapia, a former electrical product company chairman, was nominated to be our ambassador to Jamaica‚Äîa country he had not visited for about 20 years‚Äîafter donating $100,000 to Trump‚Äôs inauguration. 
Trump nominated Kelly Knight Craft, a ‚Äúgold-level‚Äù member at Trump‚Äôs hotels and whose husband donated $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inauguration, as our ambassador to Canada. She spent more than half of her time outside Canada, so Trump rewarded her by nominating her to be UN ambassador. 
Doug Manchester, a real estate executive who was accused of inappropriate behavior with female employees working for the newspaper he owned, donated $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inaugural committee. His nomination for ambassador to the Bahamas is still pending. 
Robert ‚ÄúWoody‚Äù Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who participated in a tax scheme that cost the U.S. Treasury an estimated $300 million, donated $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inaugural committee. He‚Äôs currently the ambassador to the United Kingdom. 
Gordon Sondland, Donald Trump‚Äôs ambassador to the EU, who was blocked from testifying before Congress last week, got his job after donating $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inaugural committee. 
Here are just a few of Trump‚Äôs unqualified ambassador-donors. Together, these wealthy donors gave an average of nearly $450,000 to Trump‚Äôs Inaugural committee‚Äîwhich is now under federal investigation.
For decades, administrations of both political parties appointed big donors as ambassadors. They're usually not experts in the country, foreign policy‚Äîor anything else relevant to the job. But Donald Trump perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons.
I don't spend call time asking rich donors to throw big dollar fundraisers or underwrite my campaign. My call time is spent with grassroots donors, thanking them for chipping in whatever they can. Mind if I make just a few more? 
Our democracy shouldn‚Äôt be bought and paid for by the wealthy and powerful. It belongs to all of us. Getting big money out of politics is a critical part of fighting corruption and making the big, structural change that we need.
Finally, we need to put power back in the hands of the people. So I will establish a public financing program that would give a 6-1 match for small dollar contributions to candidates and parties. And I'll lower the limits for how much individuals can contribute to campaigns.
We need to expand disclosure of fundraising and spending. The system of money for influence is helped at every stage by secrecy. We need to require additional disclosures by presidential campaigns, update laws for online political advertising, and bring dark money into the light.
I'll start by ending the corrupt system of money for influence. We must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court‚Äôs disastrous decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo. But we can and must also pass new campaign finance laws to shut down corruption.
This is a start, but voluntary changes aren‚Äôt going to be enough to clean up the corruption in our elections. That‚Äôs why when I‚Äôm president, I‚Äôll implement a comprehensive plan to permanently eliminate big money from our politics and return our democracy to the people.
Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition with the possible future leaders of our party‚Äîand how much it costs. So I‚Äôm also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign.
Today, I‚Äôm announcing that in addition to these policies, I‚Äôm not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds. My campaign is and will continue to be a grassroots campaign.
My campaign doesn‚Äôt take money from federal lobbyists or PACs, and I don't take contributions over $200 from fossil fuel or big pharma executives. No call time with rich donors or giving them special access. And when I‚Äôm the Democratic nominee, that won't change.
Corruption in Washington is holding back progress‚Äîand much of it is perfectly legal thanks to the Supreme Court. It‚Äôs time to get big money out of politics and put power back in the hands of the people‚Äîand I've got a plan for that.

Black and Latinx families are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of air pollution than white families. Environmental justice must be at the center of our response to climate change.

We must fulfill our trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. We must protect Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. And we have to go even further to empower indigenous peoples to build stronger communities and a brighter future.

Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once through negligence. Now, they've changed their policy so they can profit from lies to the American people. It's time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable‚Äîadd your name if you agree: 
The Trump campaign is currently spending $1 million a *week* on ads including ones containing known lies‚Äîads that TV stations refuse to air because they‚Äôre false. Facebook just takes the cash, no questions asked. 
Once again, we‚Äôre seeing Facebook throw its hands up to battling misinformation in the political discourse, because when profit comes up against protecting democracy, Facebook chooses profit.
Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They‚Äôve decided to let political figures lie to you‚Äîeven about Facebook itself‚Äîwhile their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies.
We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook‚Äôs ad platform to see if it‚Äôd be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook. Take a look: 
Facebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies‚Äîexplicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine. This week, we decided to see just how far it goes.
I loved meeting Antonio, the winner of our Las Vegas Pride contest! Antonio lives right here in Nevada, and I'm glad he's in this fight with me for big, structural change. 
Now let‚Äôs ban them everywhere. 
This is excellent news! Families shouldn't be penalized for needing food, housing, or health care. 
Amazon has used their immense power to limit competition, undercut small businesses, and boost their own products and profits.You can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both in the same game. It's time to

As president, I won‚Äôt blink at questions on LGBTQ+ equality. As president, I will fight shoulder to shoulder with the LGBTQ+ community. Sign up if you‚Äôre ready for a president who is ready to fight for LGBTQ+ equality.
We must take proactive steps to secure LGBTQ+ rights by passing the Equality Act. And in my first 100 days as president, I will use every legal tool to ensure that LGBTQ+ people can live free from discrimination. 
Happy  to everyone‚Äîwhether you're coming out today, you've been out for a while, you're coming out again and again, or if you're not quite ready. You are loved, and we can't wait to lift you up. I'll fight until you are free to live and thrive exactly as you are. 
Private equity firms are sucking value out of our companies, putting people out of work, and wiping out newspapers and digital news outlets like I have a plan to hold these firms accountable. 
Looking forward to it! 
Whether it‚Äôs a 5k or an election‚Äîbring it on. Thanks for the question, 
I will have a Secretary of Education who believes in public education, who believes in the value of every single one of our kids, and who will enforce our civil rights laws.  
How would I respond to someone who says marriage is between one man and one woman?  
We must use the leverage of the U.S. market to lift LGBTQ+ rights around the world. If companies want to come sell stuff here, then they must meet our standards: Labor standards, environmental standards, and human rights standards to protect LGBTQ+ communities. 
I strongly support teaching children about gender identity. We live in a world with a lot of different folks who look different, sound different, and who form different families. As Americans, we should look at this and see this as our strength. 
I was glad to answer Jacob‚Äôs question. I promised him: When I‚Äôm president, we‚Äôll have a Secretary of Education who believes in the value of every one of our kids, and who will enforce our civil rights laws to make kids like him feel safe in school. 
We believe that equal means equal. I say it because I want Republicans to hear that. I want them to know that people vote based on LGBTQ+ issues. We‚Äôll push Mitch McConnell right now‚Äîbut my main goal is that he‚Äôs not the Majority Leader come January 2021. 
I will  I will fight to end this epidemic. I will celebrate and uplift the voices of the many transgender people who are persisting and succeeding in spite of injustice. And I'll fight to ensure that every LGBTQ+ person has the opportunity to thrive.
We need a president who will  and fight to end this epidemic. We must ensure that trans women of color‚Äîand all LGBTQ+ people‚Äîaren't just safe from violence and discrimination, but also have every opportunity to thrive and succeed.
At the last LGBTQ+ forum, I read the names of 18 Black trans women who had been killed in 2019. Last night, we learned about another cruel loss, Itali Marlowe. 
Tune in tonight at 9 PM ET/6 PM PT as we talk about the big, structural change we need to make sure every LGBTQ+ American can live free from discrimination and fear. 
As president, my administration will set a goal of achieving zero emissions in all new cars, medium-duty trucks, and buses by 2030. If you‚Äôre ready to fight for bold action to confront the climate crisis, learn more here.
As president, I‚Äôll work to rapidly achieve 100% clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy in electricity generation. If you‚Äôre ready to fight for bold action to confront the climate crisis, learn more here.

Liberian immigrants fled violence and civil war and built lives, businesses, and communities here. Revoking their protection from deportation is cruel and dangerous. I'll fight to protect Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberian immigrants. 
An additional $23 a month is not nearly enough. I‚Äôve got a plan to increase Social Security benefits immediately by $200 a month.  
Everyone should get the mental health care they need and be treated with dignity and respect. I'll fight to end the stigma around mental health‚Äîand under  every person will have comprehensive mental health coverage. 
Thank you give me hope too as we fight for a better future! 
The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy, if we are going to build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.
‚Ä¢ Pass a 2¬¢ Ultra-Millionaire Tax‚Ä¢ Provide universal child care and pre-K‚Ä¢ Cancel student debt for 42 mil Americans‚Ä¢ Break up big banks and big techWhen I lead the Democratic Party, we‚Äôll fight for these big, structural changes. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.
In addition to abusing and manipulating our diplomatic relationships for Trump's political gain, we can add corruption and campaign finance violations to the list.¬†
As we fight the climate crisis, justice for communities on the front lines must be at the core of our response to climate change‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan for that. 
 Thank you for sharing your mom‚Äôs story,
Less than two months ago, AT;T signed a statement promising to value employees, not just shareholders. If they're truly serious, they should reject this plan to turn a quick profit by laying off workers and outsourcing jobs. I stand with 
Keep my boa safe, need it for 
We've made enormous strides toward equality for LGBTQ+ Americans. But that progress is already under attack, and the path to full equality is far from over. I'll fight alongside organizers and movement leaders until every LGBTQ+ person can thrive free from discrimination. 
The path to LGBTQ+ equality is far from over, but shoulder to shoulder, I‚Äôll fight alongside the leaders and organizers who have been at the helm from the very beginning. Because when we organize together, when we fight together, and when we persist together‚Äîwe can win.
At least 19 trans people have been killed just this year‚Äîalmost all of whom were Black trans women. I will create a new grant program within the Office of Violence Against Women to channel resources to organizations by and for trans people to end this crisis.
The Trump administration has sought to roll back protections for LGBTQ+ people around the world. In my administration, it will end. I'll protect LGBTQ+ asylum seekers and put the full muscle of the State Department behind protecting human rights for LGBTQ+ people globally.
As president, I‚Äôll fight to make sure that every LGBTQ+ person can get the equitable, gender-affirming health care they need. That means  And I‚Äôll immediately work to repeal the Trump administration's efforts to permit discrimination in health care.
The criminal justice system should work to ensure safety for all. My plan to reform our criminal justice system recognizes that LGBTQ+ individuals‚Äîparticularly LGBTQ+ people of color‚Äîface unique risks and are disproportionately harmed, and takes steps to reform the status quo.
I‚Äôll also push for landmark new anti-discrimination legislation to protect workers from harassment. And I am open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.
Returning power to working people will be the overarching goal of my presidency, and I‚Äôll fight to make sure that LGBTQ+ people have an equal share of an economy that works for everyone. I'll take executive action to fight workplace discrimination.
Like all people, LGBTQ+ Americans deserve safe, affordable housing. I'll increase the supply of affordable housing and strengthen protections against discrimination. And, as president, I'll develop a comprehensive LGBTQ+ youth homelessness prevention program.
LGBTQ+ youth are more likely to experience a mental health problem and attempt suicide. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll fight to ensure that LGBTQ+ youth and families are supported and protected so they can thrive. They must be treated with dignity, fairness, and love.
First, I will fight to pass the Equality Act to explicitly ban anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination. But we can‚Äôt wait on Congress. In my first 100 days as president, I‚Äôll use every legal tool we have to make sure that LGBTQ+ people can live free from discrimination.
The problems we face are deeply rooted and systemic, so this plan tackles many different areas. From health care to affordable housing, criminal justice reform, and empowering LGBTQ+ workers, I‚Äôll fight to ensure that every LGBTQ+ person has the opportunity to thrive.
LGBTQ+ activists and organizers have made enormous strides toward equality‚Äîbut that hard-won progress is already under attack. We need a president who is ready to fight back. I've got a plan to secure LGBTQ+ rights and equality. 
Shutting off power will be enormously costly to local economies and dangerous for vulnerable populations. This is not a solution to the climate crisis. We need a 100% clean and distributed energy system to build strong, climate-resilient communities. 
We can fight back against pregnancy discrimination by sharing similar stories‚Äîand by fighting for the big, structural change we need to protect pregnant people and their families. Together, we'll win. 
  recognizes the fact that environmental justice goes hand in hand with building wealth in Black and Brown communities‚Ä¶
 Thank you so much for your contributions, Joshua. The communities at the front lines of this fight should lead the way, and I want to make sure your voice is elevated.
 Honored to fight alongside you to end the climate crisis.
The communities on the front lines of the climate crisis must lead the way toward a clean energy economy, and I promise to elevate their voices in this fight.

Clean air and clean water are human rights‚Äîbut too many communities of color are denied these rights because of environmental racism. I've got a plan to fight for environmental justice. 
Yet again, a synagogue has been attacked during a Jewish holiday. I'm heartsick for the victims of this cruel attack, and Bruce and I are keeping the congregation in our hearts. We must all fight against the global rise of anti-Semitic violence. 
Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. This is a serious threat to our democracy. We need transparency and accountability from Facebook.

Congratulations to on his historic election as Montgomery, Alabama's first African American mayor! I can't wait to see the big, structural change you make.
 Thank you for fighting for LGBTQ+ rights at the Supreme Court yesterday, Alistair‚ÄîI‚Äôm in this fight alongside you all the way.
 Excellent work, Arden‚Äîplease tell Roger that he‚Äôll always have a place with us and that I‚Äôm grateful down to my toes that he‚Äôs with 
I‚Äôm going to continue helping the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates everywhere so we have the resources not just to beat Donald Trump but also to win back Congress and state legislatures all across the country. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to make big, structural change.
I will also do everything I can to build our party infrastructure and strengthen Democratic candidates up and down the ballot across the country. In 2018, I gave or raised more than $11 million to state and local candidates and parties.
My campaign is and will continue to be a grassroots campaign‚Äîfunded by working people chipping in a few bucks here and there. Chip in if that's the kind of campaign you think candidates should be running: 
And when I‚Äôm the Democratic nominee for president, I‚Äôm not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PAC money. No federal lobbyist money. No special access or call time with wealthy donors or high-dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.
As part of my campaign, I haven‚Äôt been taking PAC money or federal lobbyist money or giving special access to rich donors through call time or high-dollar fundraisers.
Whatever issue got you into politics, progress is hard because of one thing: Money. Our government works great for the wealthy and well-connected but not for anyone else.
Trump recklessly betrayed our Kurdish partners and cleared the way for Turkey‚Äôs invasion of Syria‚Äîreopening the door for ISIS and furthering a humanitarian crisis. We should bring our troops home, but we need to do so in a way that protects our security. 
Supreme Court justices should be held to a code of ethics‚Äîand held accountable when they fail to live up to it. 
As I‚Äôve traveled this country, I‚Äôve heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water. These communities need justice‚Äîand I will stand with them.
Finally, we will hold corporate polluters accountable for the damage they've done in frontline communities and for their role in the climate crisis. My administration will impose steep fines on violators, which we'll reinvest in impacted communities.
But we must ensure that we honor our commitments to fossil fuel workers as we transition to the new green economy. We'll ensure that new jobs have similar wages and benefits. And I'll fight to protect the pensions and benefits that they've earned.
As we fight the climate crisis, we have an opportunity to create millions of good-paying American jobs and rebuild our unions. We cannot fight climate change with a low-wage economy. Workers and unions must be our partners in this fight.
As we work to enact the  I'll make sure that frontline community leaders who know best what their neighborhoods need are elevated in my White House and lead the way toward the big, structural change we need. They've been doing this work for decades‚Äîwe should listen.
We need to invest in the communities who have borne the brunt of industrial pollution and are on the front lines of climate change. I'll direct at least $1 trillion to the most vulnerable communities‚Äînot just to clean up pollution, but to help them build a more resilient future.
Industrial pollution has been concentrated in communities of color due to decades of discrimination and racism‚Äîand a system that puts corporate profits before people. We need big, structural change, focused on and led by members of those communities.
Justice for communities on the front lines of the climate crisis must be at the core of our response to climate change. Here's my plan for how I'll center environmental justice in the fight to end the climate crisis. 
After I became visibly pregnant, I was told that the job I'd been promised for next year would go to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination is real, and it still happens today‚Äîbut telling our stories is one way we can fight back. Here are some of your stories that I heard today. 
Pregnancy discrimination in the workplace is illegal‚Äîsadly it‚Äôs still alarmingly common, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. 
Scientists like Dr. are warning us about what can happen if we fail to stop the climate crisis‚Äîand many communities are already seeing the effects. Those on the front lines of the climate crisis must lead the way toward a solution. 
Our federal judges must be held to the highest ethical standards‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan for that. 
Bruce and I wish a g‚Äômar chatima tovah to everyone observing Yom Kippur. May it be a meaningful fast and a day of personal introspection and reflection.

The Trump administration is arguing that the Supreme Court should undo the progress we've made and let employers fire LGBTQ+ people because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. We need a president that will fight discrimination and protect LGBTQ+ rights. 
This was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination‚Äîbut we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.
When I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant‚Äîand the principal told me the job I'd already been promised for the next year would go to someone else.
Our legal system loses its legitimacy when the American people don‚Äôt believe that judges will be ethical and fair-minded. It's time to make sure our federal judges are held to the highest ethical standards. And I've got a plan for that:  
Equal justice under law.We believe it, now it's time to act on it.That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve got a plan to hold our judges to the highest ethical standards. 
We need accountability. That should start with Congress and the appropriate state authorities opening investigations and conducting hearings to make Facebook executives explain the company‚Äôs policies and practices‚Äîunder oath.
In fact, this time they‚Äôre going further by taking deliberate steps to help one candidate intentionally mislead the American people, while painting the candidacy of others (specifically: mine) as an "existential‚Äù threat. This is a serious concern for our democratic process.
There‚Äôs no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played in that successful attack, nor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election.
Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy‚Äîallowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections.
They‚Äôre allowing Trump to spend over $1 million a week right now for ads on their platform‚Äîincluding ones that air the same lies that TV stations won‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs an example of an ad that Facebook let Trump run despite being obviously untrue:  
After that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers. Put another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies.
For instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about? 
Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an ‚Äúexistential‚Äù threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.
The daily toll of gun violence in communities across the country is overwhelming. I‚Äôm heartsick for the victims and their families. We need action to end gun violence‚Äînow. 
China is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles‚Äîand our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights. 
It shouldn't take a federal judge to force a candidate to disclose their tax returns. My plan to end corruption would require any candidate for federal office to disclose their tax returns.

These changes will allow us to hold bad actors accountable, and begin to restore accountability and trust in a fair, impartial federal judiciary.
We'll ensure that Supreme Court justices follow a code of ethics, too. That means that a judge accused of lying to Congress, like Brett Kavanaugh, could face a full judicial investigation. And they couldn't end that investigation by being elevated to the Supreme Court.
It‚Äôs time for fundamental reform. My plan will ensure that federal judges do not hear cases where they have conflicts of interest, strengthen our nation‚Äôs ethics rules for judges, and ensure accountability for those who violate these rules.
And when judges have come under investigation, they can simply resign to avoid accountability. That's how Donald Trump‚Äôs sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ended an investigation into the Trump family‚Äôs potential tax fraud and other tax schemes.
Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia did not recuse themselves from Citizens United v. FEC, the case that opened an avalanche of money in politics to the benefit of people like the Koch brothers, who invited the pair on multiple all-expenses paid retreats.
A basic principle of our federal judicial system is that judges make decisions as disinterested, impartial observers. Yet several judges have ruled on cases while owning stock in companies arguing before them.
Our legal system loses its legitimacy when the American people don‚Äôt believe that judges will be ethical and fair-minded. I have a plan to strengthen the integrity and impartiality of the federal judiciary. 
We continue to break records as our planet gets hotter and hotter. We need urgent action now to end the climate crisis. 
It‚Äôs disgusting that the Trump administration is arguing in favor of discrimination. We need an administration that will fight to protect LGBTQ+ rights. 
Americans will lose trust in our judicial system if they no longer believe that our judges will be held to the highest ethical standards. Like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached.  
We cannot have a truly democratic society with so little power in the hands of working people. We cannot have sustained and inclusive economic growth without a stronger labor movement.

I will also remake the federal courts with nominees who support working people. That starts at the top: I pledge as president to nominate a demonstrated advocate for workers to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.
Every worker should be treated with dignity and respect, and be safe in their place of employment. Any employer that fails to do so should be held accountable. My administration will expand worker protections, combat discrimination, and improve enforcement against violations.
Over the past few decades, workers have been left with fewer employment choices and less control over the companies that employ them. I'll reverse that trend by increasing worker choice and control, including requiring large companies to let workers elect board members.
My administration will raise wages for workers and protect the hard-earned pensions and retirement savings of working people. We'll start by raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers, including tipped workers and workers with disabilities.
Next, we'll strengthen organizing rights, make it easier for unions to assert their rights, and we‚Äôll expand the right to strike. Unions built America‚Äôs middle class, and they will rebuild the middle class.
My agenda to return power to working people starts with extending labor rights to all workers‚Äîincluding workers who have been misclassified as "independent contractors." We‚Äôll also extend basic protections to farm workers and domestic workers, including the right to organize.
We can't have a truly democratic society with so little power in the hands of working people‚Äîand we can't have sustained and inclusive economic growth without a stronger labor movement. That‚Äôs why returning power to working people will be the overarching goal of my presidency.
Giant corporations and their allies in Washington and state governments have spent decades systematically attacking unions. As more power has shifted into the hands of Wall Street managers and CEOs, it‚Äôs taken trillions of dollars out of the pockets of working families.
Even as corporate profits have soared, working families are hanging on by their fingernails. I've got a plan for the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal. 
Corporate interests spent $2.8 billion on lobbying just last year. We have to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Washington. That's why I'm proposing a new tax on excessive lobbying.

If my plan to tax excessive lobbying had been in place during that time, Facebook would've paid $39 million in taxes‚Äîmoney that could've been directed to the FTC's antitrust efforts. We have to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Washington.

To make big, structural change, we're going to need a movement working for change from the outside and a leader willing to act. I applaud the work of these activists‚Äîand when I'm president, we'll ban private prisons. 
Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.
We can end excessive lobbying. This is the kind of big, structural change we need to put power back in the hands of the people and end corruption in Washington.
Nobody will be surprised that the top five industries that would've paid the most are those that have spent the last decade fighting tooth and nail against popular policies: Big Pharma, health insurance companies, oil and gas companies, Wall Street firms, and electric utilities.
Every dollar raised will be placed into a new Lobbying Defense Trust Fund dedicated to directing a surge of resources to Congress and federal agencies to fight back against these lobbying onslaughts when they occur.
My tax on excessive lobbying would apply to every corporation and trade group that spends over $500,000 a year lobbying our government. If this tax had been in effect over the last 10 years, over 1,600 corporations and trade groups would've paid an estimated $10 billion in taxes.
Corporate lobbyists swarm Congress and our federal departments to weaken, delay, or kill efforts to implement laws they don't like. They spent more than $2.8 billion on lobbying last year alone.
We have to break the grip that lobbyists have on our government for good. My plan to end Washington corruption calls for something unique‚Äîa new tax on excessive lobbying. 
When you find a good one, grab them and hang on.

Americans don't trust their government precisely because of this. My plan to end Washington corruption would ban members of Congress from serving on corporate boards and owning or trading individual stocks. No exceptions.

So many incredible LGBTQ+ Americans have fought for big, structural change so that everyone could  I‚Äôm honored to keep up the fight. 
I won't let giant corporations dictate our trade policy anymore. I'll use America's leverage to support working families, protect the environment, and raise the standard of living across the globe. 
Saddened to learn of the passing of Enrique Fern√°ndez-Toledo. He was a champion for Puerto Rico, especially in the island‚Äôs time of need. I greatly valued his insights and advocacy, and my heart goes out to his family and friends. 
Imagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security. That's why we need to 
My plan to  would undo their illegal, anticompetitive mergers. You'll still be able to use Facebook and Instagram to catch up with friends and family and share photos of your dog. But they'll have to compete with each other to make a better product for you.
Zuckerberg himself said Facebook is ‚Äúmore like a government than a traditional company.‚Äù They‚Äôve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. 
Facebook is doing pretty well right now. They've acquired potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram. More than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook. They've got a lot of power‚Äîand face little competition or accountability.
Let's talk a bit about my plan to  and why it's got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.
 Thank you so much for teaching me, Kirsten, and for all of your hard work! We‚Äôre in this fight together.
We have to fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.  
I loved being a teacher‚Äîand I‚Äôm humbled to see some of my former students joining the fight for big, structural change! 
We all use Facebook, Amazon, and Google. But in their rise to power, they‚Äôve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field in their favor. It‚Äôs time to break them up so they don‚Äôt have so much power over everyone else. Sign on today.
Washington, D.C. has over 700,000 residents‚Äîmore than Wyoming or Vermont. They pay federal taxes. They deserve an equal voice in our government, and I'll fight until they get statehood. 
My heart goes out to the families and friends of those we lost during the  shooting two years ago today. I'll keep fighting to end gun violence in America.
I'm not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable. It's time to  
What would really ‚Äúsuck‚Äù is if we don‚Äôt fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.

I‚Äôll see you at Pride, Las Vegas! 
Nevertheless, we persist!  
Loved talking with Collyn from Dorchester, Massachusetts! Collyn chipped in $25.75 to our grassroots campaign, so I called to say thank you. We both agreed: It‚Äôs time to make our government work for all of us.  
A year has passed, but Donald Trump and his administration have done nothing to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. He and his family deserve justice.  
Donald Trump is committing crimes from the Oval Office. He must be impeached‚Äîand every single person involved must be held accountable. 
Again, Donald Trump abused the United States' diplomatic channels for his own personal political gain. And again, he attempted to hide his actions. 
 It was great talking with you, Collyn.
I just called Maria from Concord, New Hampshire, to thank her for the $25 donation she made today. Together, we‚Äôre going to dream big and fight hard. Thank you, Maria!  
Yes, Cree, it was really me! Cree is an HIV Prevention Coordinator from Minnesota. They pitched in to our campaign today, so I called them to say thanks. We‚Äôre in this together, Cree.  
I talked with another Bailey‚Äîthis time Bailey from Iowa. She chipped in $3 earlier today, so I called her to tell her how grateful I am.Two Baileys and an Elizabeth‚Äîsurely we can get this done! Chip in now, and I could call you next.  
I'm starting my grassroots call time now‚Äîhave you donated yet? I might give you a call to say thanks!  
Today‚Äôs the last day to donate before our big FEC deadline. I‚Äôll be calling grassroots donors again tonight‚Äîbe sure to chip in if you want to talk with me about the big, structural change we‚Äôre making together. 
 Donate any amount, and might just call you next:  
Thank you so much for inviting me to speak with you. When unions win, all workers win. Together, we‚Äôll fight for a country that works for all of us‚Äînot just the giant corporations. 
I've lived in an America where abortions were illegal. Women still got abortions‚Äîbut they were dangerous and too often deadly. The Hyde Amendment harms the most vulnerable women by limiting their ability to safely access abortion. It's time for Hyde to go. 
Shana Tovah to all those who are celebrating Rosh Hashanah! Bruce and I wish you a sweet, happy, healthy new year.
Our campaign is grassroots funded: That means no fancy fundraisers, no PACs, no federal lobbyists.Our big quarterly FEC deadline is tonight. Will you chip in $3 before midnight to help power our grassroots campaign? 
This is what call time means to me: Talking with grassroots donors who give whatever they can to build this movement. I'm making more calls tomorrow. Chip in $3 or whatever you can, and I might just call you to say thanks!  
It's going to take big, structural change to tackle poverty and inequality in the U.S., and "A Just Society" is just the type of bold, comprehensive thinking we'll need to get it done. 
On this  Bruce and I are thinking of Gold Star moms everywhere. Our hearts go out to you, and we are grateful for your strength and resolve.
 I‚Äôm so sorry I missed you, Alaina! Thank you so much for chipping in to our campaign. Stay strong out there!
Karylinda works at GM and is out on strike‚Äîbut she still donated $3. So I called her to say thank you. We're all in this fight together, Karylinda.  
I got a chance to say thank you to Juliana from Brooklyn, who chipped in $5 to our grassroots campaign. And she‚Äôll be a first-time voter! Thank you, Juliana.  
I‚Äôm calling a few more grassroots donors from the road today to thank them for chipping in to our campaign! If you donate now, I could call you next:  
We've got to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Congress‚Äîand I've got a plan for that. 
Every time I talk to a grassroots donor, I feel fired up about the big, structural change we can build together. I‚Äôm calling more people today‚Äîchip in $3 if you want to chat. 
I've been a public school teacher. And I'm committed to having a Secretary of Education who has also been a public school teacher. 
Right now, we've got an economy that's working great for those at the top, but not so great for everyone else. We need big structural change to make sure everyone has an opportunity to succeed‚Äîstarting with a two-cent wealth tax. 
GM made billions of dollars in profits, but closed multiple plants in the United States. GM has no loyalty to the workers of America or the people of America. workers are fighting back‚Äîand I'm proud to march alongside them. 
 I'm with Warren because she's been a fierce consumer advocate for decades. Again and again fearlessly and effectively‚Ä¶
Our big FEC fundraising deadline is tomorrow, but you won‚Äôt find me jetting from city to city scooping up big checks from wealthy donors and special interests.This campaign is powered by grassroots donors. Will you chip in $3 now? 
I‚Äôm grateful for Lucas from Arizona, who chipped in $10 to our grassroots campaign. We talked about the importance of building a grassroots movement to hold our government accountable. Thanks, Lucas!  
I talked with Maura, a lawyer from NYC, earlier today. She chipped in $3 to this fight for big, structural change. Thank you, Maura!  
Thank you for the warm welcome, South Carolina! Bruce and I had a fantastic time at we're going to make the big, structural change we need to build an economy and a government that works for all of us‚Äînot just the wealthy and well-connected! 
Terrific meal‚Äîand a group photo! 
I‚Äôm deeply grateful for the grassroots movement we‚Äôre building together. But we need the resources to keep growing.Will you chip in $3 before our FEC fundraising deadline so we‚Äôll have what it takes to win in 2020? 
 You know those videos of calling her grassroots donors? That could be you. She‚Äôs still making those calls now until M‚Ä¶
Jahnavi from Arizona chipped in $10, so I called from the car to say thanks! This is how we‚Äôre going to do it, building a grassroots movement all across the country.  
 Woo-hoo!
We must break the NRA‚Äôs stranglehold on our government. I've got a plan to pass sweeping anti-corruption legislation so that our nation will no longer be held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists. 
Bruce and I love to hike. We‚Äôve been from Utah to Alaska to the Cape Cod National Seashore. Public lands are some of our greatest treasures‚Äîand we must protect them. Let‚Äôs recommit to preserving and enhancing them. I‚Äôve got a plan for that.   
It should be quick and easy to join a union. I'm standing with and the Rockingham County Rehabilitation and Nursing Center employees, because those who are taking care of our family members should be able to provide a decent life for their families, too. 
Left a voicemail for Rachel, a writer from New York who pitched in $15. I told her to stay in the fight. Thank you, Rachel!  
Just got off the phone with Joe from Massachusetts (yay!) who joined the fight by contributing $28 to our grassroots campaign. We‚Äôre doing this together, Joe.Who will I talk to next?  
 Not ridiculous at all! Glad we got to chat.
You bet. Grassroots call time is when I get to talk with voters and listen to what gets them into this fight. We‚Äôre going to do this together!Chip in next, and I could call you soon:  
Here‚Äôs the deal: I‚Äôll be calling grassroots donors again today to thank them for chipping into our campaign.Will you chip in whatever you can now? If you get a call from an unknown number, it might just be me. 
Then we have to go even further to correct historical injustices and ensure that everyone has an opportunity at a higher education. I've got a plan to create a minimum $50 billion fund for HBCUs, TCUs, and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). 
If the Senate doesn't pass the FUTURE Act by Monday, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges and universities, and other Minority Serving Institutions will lose $255 million of funding. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill‚Äînow. 
We should stand with the protesters in Egypt fighting for a better future‚Äîand we must be clear that violence and repression are unacceptable responses to those who seek to express their opinion or affect political change. 
I had a great time in Hollis, New Hampshire today! We're going to dream big, fight hard, and win together. 
I still believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. And like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached.
The NRA is a corrupt group of well-financed extremists who have made it perfectly clear that they will never put the safety of the American people first. We must hold them accountable. 
Fallon, I'm so excited for you! Thank you for keeping our pinkie-promise and running for school president. That *is* what girls do! 
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in living memory.I believe we can win the White House, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020‚Äîbut only if we all work together.Will you donate before our FEC deadline? 
That is, in fact, exactly what the CFPB is supposed to do. 
 üíô Monday is a critical end-of-quarter fundraising deadline, and it‚Äôs time to show our candidate we have her back. I‚Äôm on 
Refugees are fleeing violence and oppression, and our values compel us to help them. As president, I'll reverse Trump's cruel, bigoted policies and welcome at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term. 
After the past two CEOs failed, Mr. Scharf has a lot of work to do to clean up Wells Fargo and to ensure that all of the people hurt by the bank's past scams get every penny of relief they're owed. I'll be watching him carefully. 
‚ÄúNo one was embraced at the New Hampshire Democratic Party‚Äôs state convention Saturday quite like Elizabeth Warren.‚Äú‚ÄòThere is a lot at stake, and people are scared,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòBut we can‚Äôt choose a candidate we don‚Äôt believe in because we‚Äôre scared.‚Äô‚Äù
‚Äú‚ÄòThis is our moment in American history. It comes to us‚Ä¶to get organized, to build a grassroots movement, to persist and to build the country of our best values,‚Äô Warren said.‚Äù
‚Äú‚ÄòShe‚Äôs the one who has plans. She‚Äôs the one who can articulate her vision for the future. She has more substance than anybody else,‚Äô Harriett Harris, a voter volunteering for Warren‚Äôs campaign at the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention, told BuzzFeed News."
‚Äú‚ÄòI know how to fight and I know how to win,‚Äô Warren responded to Rhodes. ‚ÄòI think what‚Äôs going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe. I think you‚Äôve got to give people a reason to show up and vote and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äô‚Äù
"In Iowa alone, Warren has attended 36 events, spoken to more than 7,000 Iowans and taken almost 5,000 selfies over eight trips. She also employs more than 50 paid staff members in the state, which has garnered the attention of top local Democrats."
‚ÄúEvery time we see a budget, it‚Äôs really just a statement of our values. Is it more important to leave the two cents for the bazillionaires or use that two cents to invest in all of our kids? Well, I‚Äôm here because I think we ought to be investing in all of our kids.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf winning the Democratic nomination requires wooing the party‚Äôs progressive wing and harnessing the power of activist women, then Senator Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that.‚Äù
 I‚Äôm sorry I missed you, Kerry! Thank you for the work you do every day as an educator‚Äîand don‚Äôt worry, those first-year teacher jitters will go away soon.
I love going on the road and meeting all our supporters! I especially love when I get to do it with Bruce by my side. 
 Just got a call from the one and only I‚Äôm so happy to be in this fight with you! Gonna be riding this high A‚Ä¶
Molly from Maryland chipped in $15‚Äîthank you for making a difference! Together, we can rein in Wall Street corruption and make our economy work for working people.  
Glad I got to talk with Athena, a photographer from Minnesota! Athena pitched in to our campaign for the first time‚Äîdonate now, and you might get a call from me soon, too!  
 I'm sorry I missed you. But I'm glad you got some sleep! We're going to need you well-rested and ready for this fight.
I talked with Shaun from Oregon about my plan to nominate a former public school teacher for Secretary of Education.We agree: We need someone who will actually fight for our kids. Thank you for chipping in $3!

I stand with and Public school teachers deserve adequate staffing, pay equity, and smaller class sizes. When teachers succeed, students succeed!   
Time and time again, widely popular policies are narrowed or blocked by powerful interests capable of providing resources and information to a vastly under-resourced Congress. These steps will help break our government from the grip of lobbyists and help it work for all of us.
My plan revives and modernizes the Office of Technology Assessment, shores up congressional support agencies, and transitions congressional staff to competitive salaries‚Äîso we can have competent public policy that actually holds big corporations accountable.
I've got a plan to end lobbying as we know it‚Äîbut strengthening Congress‚Äô independence requires us to do more. We must invest in resources to allow members of Congress to make informed decisions without relying on self-interested outside sources.
And when Congress votes on restoring net neutrality protections, our representatives shouldn‚Äôt have to turn to internet service providers to explain whether their industry needs more regulation. 
When Congress decides whether it should break up big tech companies, our representatives shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on Google‚Äôs policy team to understand the effects of technology consolidation. 
When Congress debates the  our representatives shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on Exxon lobbyists to explain who should pay for the effects of carbon emissions on our planet. 
I saw firsthand how this system works when I was fighting for the CFPB. Financial reform is complicated, and bank lobbyists bombarded Congress with complex arguments and obscure terms. It's the ultimate insiders‚Äô play: "Trust us because we understand it and you don‚Äôt."
Over the last 20 years, lobbyist spending has skyrocketed. At the same time, Congress has been starved of resources to objectively analyze complex public policy issues, leaving corporate lobbyist propaganda to fill the gap. I've got a plan to fix that: 
Now that call time is done, it's Bailey's turn to have some fun! 
Thank you for standing up and speaking out, I‚Äôll be fighting alongside you until we  
This is a disgrace. Eugene Scalia spent his career putting the interests of giant corporations ahead of American workers. I stand ready to fight back to protect worker's rights.

I just spoke to Marc, a commercial fisherman from Alaska, who chipped in to our campaign. I‚Äôm so grateful to have him in this fight. Will you chip in next? I‚Äôm making some more calls tonight.  
I‚Äôm about to call grassroots donors who chipped in to our campaign today. Whether you can pitch in $1 here or $15 there, we all own a piece of this movement. 
This is deeply disturbing and illustrates just how urgently we need Congress to address this issue. Andrea, thank you for your bravery‚ÄîI‚Äôll fight alongside you to end sexual harassment in VA centers. 
I'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need.

Thank you, Keene, New Hampshire! We're going to make big, structural change together. 
Donald Trump is just the worst symptom of a corrupt system. The problems in Washington are much bigger than him‚Äîand it's going to take big, structural change to fundamentally transform our government. I've got a plan to root out corruption in Washington. 
Donald Trump believes he is above the law‚Äîand he will continue to commit crimes from the White House until we hold him accountable. The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment‚Äîand when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.
Donald Trump solicited foreign interference in our elections from the Oval Office. He attempted to cover up his actions. And his appointees intervened, against the law, to attempt to suppress this whistleblower complaint. 
I don't spend ‚Äúcall time" on the phone with millionaires asking for big checks. I spend my ‚Äúcall time‚Äù talking with voters and thanking grassroots donors.Donate to my campaign right now, let me know when you‚Äôve chipped in, and I might call you tonight!  
12 congressional investigations.10 federal criminal investigations.8 state and local investigations.The Trump administration is the most corrupt of our lifetimes. And it‚Äôs time to hold them accountable.
 Right back at you! Great job on  it‚Äôs such an important law that will help so many working families.
Thank you for your support, Shoulder to shoulder, we‚Äôre going to fight for  No one should be able to make a profit off of denying people health care‚Äîand together, we‚Äôll win. 
I love calling grassroots supporters to say thanks for donating to my campaign. Hearing your stories about what gets you into this fight inspires me every day! Chip in $3 before our FEC deadline, and I could call you next. Let‚Äôs do this together:  
No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. It‚Äôs Congress' constitutional responsibility to hold Trump accountable‚Äîand the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands. 
Insurance companies make a profit by denying necessary health care for millions of people. It's not right‚Äîand it's why I'm fighting for  Thank you for being a part of this fight, and for your courage to speak your truth. We're going to do this together. 
 and I are sending our deepest condolences to Zac‚Äôs family and friends. He was a dedicated, treasured member of our team, and he will be deeply missed. 
No child should go to school hungry. The Trump administration's move to cancel free school lunches for hundreds of thousands of children is just cruel. 
Women held at Karnes Detention Center are receiving inadequate medical care‚Äîand now ICE wants to transfer them in order to detain more families. This cruelty must end. We must stop unnecessary detention and welcome those seeking asylum. 
 Good luck! Fight hard.
The president admitted it.The "transcript" confirms it.Donald Trump continues to commit crimes from the Oval Office, and the Justice Department refuses to hold him accountable. Now it‚Äôs on Congress to act. No one is above the law‚Äînot even the president.
Corvias has failed to maintain the military homes they were entrusted with. Why should they be entrusted with providing a hotel for especially while students face an affordable housing crisis? 
Johana Medina Leon and Layleen Cubilette-Polanco should be alive right now. We must enforce strict standards for medical care for LGBTQ+ people in custody. We must end cash bail. We must end the unnecessary detainment of asylum seekers. 
This "transcript" itself is a smoking gun. If this is the version of events the president's team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy. We need to see the full whistleblower complaint and the administration needs to follow the law. Now. 
As soon as I left the picket line, I called Cynthia to let her know that I have her back. We're in this fight together. 
No child should be denied a loving home because of bigotry and discrimination. LGBTQ+ couples who want to open their hearts and their homes deserve our support‚Äîand I'll continue to stand with them. 
We're making big investments this fall to keep growing  and to help candidates that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures.Dream big, fight hard‚Äîand together, we'll win! 
Today's hearing on Trump's bigoted and xenophobic Muslim Ban was an important first step. Now it's time for Congress to pass the No Ban Act. 
Trump and his administration are putting reporters‚Äô lives at risk. 
The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands. The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment‚Äîand when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires. Sign up now if you‚Äôre with me.

Change happens when a grassroots movement pushes from the outside, and leaders are willing to lead from the inside. Thank you to everyone who protested, organized, and asked the crucial questions to get us to this moment. This is an overdue but important step.
No one is above the law‚Äînot even the president of the United States. Congress has the constitutional authority and responsibility to hold the president accountable. This is not about politics, this is about principle. We must begin impeachment proceedings.
I called for impeachment five months ago, the day after the Mueller report came out. Trump continues to commit crimes because he believes he‚Äôs above the law. If Congress does nothing to respond, he‚Äôll be right. We must begin impeachment proceedings‚Äînow. 
Our democracy also depends on protecting our right to vote. I've got a plan to establish strong federal standards to make it easier to register to vote, including automatic and same-day voter registration.  
Our democracy depends on all of us stepping forward and making our voices heard. Celebrate  by registering to vote or double-checking your voter registration at  And when you‚Äôre done, get five friends to do it, too. 
In 1974, Democrats and Republicans united in support of impeachment out of mutual respect for the rule of law. Congress refused to be complicit in future law-breaking by Nixon or other presidents. It‚Äôs time for this Congress to step up and act. If you‚Äôre with me, sign up now.

Wages barely budge, costs are rising, and more Americans are falling deeper into debt. Our government has failed us, allowing more wealth to be sucked up by those at the top, and leaving everyone else behind. This is why we need big, structural change. 
The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy, if we are going to build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.
The House must impeach. It must start today.
The best place to meet is on the picket line! Great to see you, 
Before I joined the picket line in Detroit, I met with UAW leadership. Their workers are putting everything on the line to fight for a fair wage and hold GM accountable‚Äîand I'm standing with them.  
The enthusiasm and energy from  is what keeps me going! 
Thank you, for inviting me to speak at  Together, we can build a grassroots movement to make big, structural change.

I want to recognize the grassroots donors who make this campaign happen. Donate now, and we‚Äôll put your name on my new online grassroots donor wall! Whether you can pitch in $5 or $10 or whatever you can, we all own a piece of our democracy. 
Extreme right-wing ideologues aren't just threatening reproductive rights in the United States‚Äîthey're threatening those rights around the world. We need a president who will be committed to protecting reproductive rights for everyone. 
Keep speaking the truth and fighting for big, structural change, Change is possible when millions of people push for it‚Äîand when leaders are willing to listen and lead. I promise to fight alongside you and do everything I can to end the climate crisis. 
I have a bill to lower drug prices by directing HHS to step in and manufacture generic drugs when the market fails‚Äîand we'll start producing insulin in 1 year. We can't allow companies to corner the market on essential drugs, jack up prices, and cash in on the backs of patients.
No one should have to choose between medication or housing. No one should be forced to ration insulin and risk dangerous complications. We need  we need to tackle corruption and price gouging in drug manufacturing head on. 
The workers of are standing up for good benefits and fair wages‚Äîand they're fighting for all of us. When unions win, every worker wins. I'm proud to stand with them.  
On  every day‚Äîwe recommit to securing equal rights for every LGBTQ+ American until they can live openly and proudly. Everyone deserves to live without fear or discrimination. 
If you made it to the very top‚Äîthat‚Äôs great for you! But you have to chip in to make sure everyone else has an opportunity to succeed, too. 
Thank you, Sara! Proud to stand alongside you and Unions built the middle class, and unions will rebuild the middle class. 
If you‚Äôre ready to join this fight, then chip in whatever you can right now. Not only will your contribution make a big difference‚Äîwe‚Äôll put your name on my new online grassroots donor wall.

 Thank you for all of your work, Ambereen! We‚Äôre going to keep fighting for America‚Äôs public school teachers.
 So good to see you, Cecile! Definitely no better place to catch up.
Liza, this is my promise to you: We‚Äôre going to fix this, together. For your family and for immigrant families everywhere. 
Hopefully one day Viola can come visit Bailey in the White House! 
I'm glad to join picket line today in Detroit as auto workers fight for basic rights like fair wages and health care. I have their backs.  
I stand shoulder to shoulder with the Chicago teachers making their voices heard to demand living wages, smaller class sizes, and all the things teachers need to do their jobs well. America's teachers take on powerful work every day, and we must treat them with respect. 
It shouldn't be. We got into this crisis because states and the federal government have passed the cost of higher education onto students and their families. We need universal free public college‚Äîand we need to cancel student loan debt. 
The daily toll of gun violence is staggering. We need to pass comprehensive gun violence legislation‚Äîand we need to tackle the corruption that has held up any attempts to end this epidemic. 
I loved going to our house party in Mount Vernon yesterday and listening to what gets people in this fight. As president, I promise to fight for the big, structural changes that Iowa and the country needs. 
Stopped by Hamburg Inn in Iowa City for a strawberry rhubarb pie milkshake yesterday. Delicious! 
America has a housing crisis‚Äîand working families are feeling it hard. Yesterday at Golfview Mobile Home Court, I talked with the people of North Liberty about how we can level the playing field for all families. My housing plan makes it possible:  
Chicago‚Äôs nurses fight their hearts out for their patients. They deserve to be treated with respect‚Äîand that means adequate staffing levels. I will always stand and fight alongside our nurses.  
You inspire me, Activists have always been the driving force behind big, structural change‚Äîand yesterday‚Äôs powerful  proved that together, we have a fighting chance at ending our climate crisis. Where you lead, I‚Äôll follow. 
Today at the Iowa  I said what I‚Äôve been saying since April: It‚Äôs time for us to call out Donald Trump‚Äôs illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings‚Äînow. 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in a terrific Democratic tradition. I promise to keep dreaming big and fighting hard alongside the people of Iowa.

Wall Street executives believe that Elizabeth has ‚Äúgot to be stopped.‚Äù If big banks and CEOs are scared, we must be doing something right. Will you chip in to help her end Wall Street‚Äôs stranglehold on our economy and show that this grassroots movement will only grow stronger?
Elizabeth is running to be the best president that money can‚Äôt buy. And her ideas for big, structural change have Wall Street executives shaking in their freshly polished leather shoes. But we can‚Äôt do this without you. Will you chip in now to help power our grassroots movement?

Our laws don't consistently protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It's past time to change that‚Äîstarting by passing the Equality Act. 
Eighteen Black trans women have been killed so far this year. It‚Äôs time for a president of the United States of America to   
Eighteen Black trans women have been killed this year. This is an epidemic, and we need to call it out.  
I‚Äôll be live soon at the  Tune in: 
Eight years ago, President Obama repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell. It was an important step towards protecting  service members' rights. But Trump's ban on trans service members has set us back again. When I'm president, I'll reverse this ban and protect LGBTQ service members.
Trans women who experience homelessness are already disproportionately more likely to face violence. If Secretary Carson is not willing to do his job and protect all Americans experiencing housing insecurity then he shouldn't have his job.
Secretary Carson's transphobic remarks are completely unacceptable. 
In 1974, Democrats and Republicans united in support of impeachment not out of mutual contempt for Nixon but mutual respect for the rule of law. Congress refused to be complicit in future law-breaking by Nixon or other presidents. It‚Äôs time for this Congress to step up and act.
Mitch McConnell is also complicit. The Senate must vote on the bill, already passed by the House, to help states and localities protect themselves from the foreign attacks on our elections that the President has previously welcomed.
A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won‚Äôt either. Today‚Äôs news confirmed he thinks he‚Äôs above the law. If we do nothing, he‚Äôll be right.
After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump‚Äôs latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.
Trump's ‚Äúmetering‚Äù and "Remain in Mexico" policies are putting immigrant families at risk. I will end these cruel policies and ensure asylum seekers are welcomed. 
 Ha, I do! I hope your meeting went well and your plans are ready to go.
Thank you, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to stop the climate crisis‚Äîand that starts with eliminating the filibuster so that we can make the big, structural change we desperately need to save our planet. 
Take any big problem that we face in America today, and you don't have to dig deep to see corruption at work, holding up progress and putting us at risk. I know what's broken‚Äîand I've got a plan to fix it. That's why I'm running for president of the United States. 
Today, my heart is with the people of Puerto Rico as we continue to mourn the lives lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria two years ago. The federal government failed our fellow citizens‚Äîand you bet I‚Äôm fighting with everything I've got to ensure that never happens again.
Thank you for making working families the center of your campaign. This is our moment to fight for an America that works for all of us‚Äînot just the people at the top. Let's keep fighting. 
I'm ready to fight, and I've got big plans to meet the goals of the  and achieve 100% clean energy for America.

So grateful to have had with me at our Washington Square Park event. has been on the front line of the fight for racial and economic justice, and I'm honored to have their support. We're going to build this grassroots movement together. 
Last night, I called up grassroots donors who chipped in to my campaign to say thanks‚Äîand you could be next.Will you chip in now, too? Even $3 makes a big difference, especially with our FEC fundraising deadline right around the corner. 
I want every little girl to grow up knowing that when they fight from the heart, they can win. And we pinky promise so they won‚Äôt forget. 
Our economy works great for people who can use their money and power to become even richer and more powerful. But I've got a plan to ensure it works for everyone else too. If that scares hedge fund billionaires like this guy, fine by me. 
The Trump administration is trying to stack the deck against asylum applicants. That's not right‚Äîour laws and values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. When I'm president, I'll undo his dangerous policies and welcome asylum seekers. 
Border Patrol agents are not asylum officers. They shouldn't get to determine who meets the "credible fear" standard for asylum. Seeking asylum is not a crime, and we shouldn‚Äôt be treating refugees this way. 
 Sorry I missed you, LaVel! Grateful down to my toes to have you in this fight.
 Thank you, Eve‚ÄîI‚Äôm so sorry I missed you! I know that together, we can take the power from the NRA and the lawmakers in their pockets and return it to the people.
 Thank you, Erin‚Äîgrateful down to my toes to have your support!
My heart goes out to and his family after the loss of his wife, Emily. An activist and librarian who raised tens of thousands of dollars to help students attend college, she was a fixture in her community, and she will be deeply missed. 
Bridgette‚Äôs story highlights so many problems with our criminal justice system‚Äîfrom how it fails to protect survivors of domestic violence, to the injustice of mandatory minimums, to the lack of rehabilitative services. I've got a comprehensive plan for reform. 
It's time to get rid of the Electoral College. 
Today's historic hearing in the House of Representatives is an important step towards  Washington D.C. residents deserve an equal voice in our government‚Äîthey deserve statehood now.
Thank you to everyone who passed me a note in the selfie line in New York City‚Äîthey mean the world to me. 
Today is National HIV/AIDS and Aging Awareness Day. Thanks to improvements in treatments, those with HIV can live longer, fuller lives. We need  to ensure that everyone who needs treatment gets it.  
It's time for management to sit down and negotiate a fair contract with workers. 
  explains why these are ‚Äòscary times.‚Äô  
If we're going to make big, structural change, we're going to need someone leading from the inside‚Äîbut we'll also need a grassroots movement pushing from the outside. The selfie line gives me a moment (or a few thousand moments) to meet that movement.

Our reproductive rights are under attack. But I‚Äôm tired of being on defense‚ÄîI‚Äôm ready to go on offense. With supporters and organizers like I believe that we can protect and expand our reproductive rights. 
It was a marathon, but we made it! See you tonight at 9pm ET, 
I've got a plan to protect reproductive care from right-wing ideologues in every state and ensure real access to birth control and abortion care for all. I'll make sure our reproductive rights are protected no matter what the Supreme Court does.

Corruption killed over 100 women in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. But in the aftermath of that tragedy, women workers organized, fought back, and secured major victories. I know big, structural change is possible‚Äîbecause America's done it before. 
 Thanks for sticking around until the end, Matt! Selfies and big, structural change‚Äîtwo promises I‚Äôll keep.
 We‚Äôre excited to work for working families with you too, 
Politicians and advisors like Donald Trump Jr. have reportedly tried to receive help from foreign countries. We will clarify the definition of ‚Äúin-kind contributions‚Äù to ensure that no candidate can receive political assistance from foreign countries. Sign up if you‚Äôre with me.
Right now, the legal definition of lobbying is so limited that powerful interests can keep their influence-peddling in the shadows. We‚Äôll expand the definition to include anyone who is paid to influence lawmakers. If you‚Äôre ready to end lobbying as we know it, sign up now.
Today, every federal judge is bound by a Code of Conduct ‚Äì except Supreme Court justices. It‚Äôs a recipe for corruption. We can fix it by applying the Code of Conduct for United States Judges to Supreme Court justices. Sign up now if you‚Äôre with me.
Sexual assault and perjury complaints against Brett Kavanaugh were dismissed when he was confirmed to the Supreme Court ‚Äì that‚Äôs ridiculous. Under my plan, investigations will remain open until their findings are made public and any penalties for misconduct are issued.
Under current law, members of Congress can trade stocks and then use their powerful positions to increase the value of those stocks. Under my plan, we will ban members of Congress and senior government officials from owning or trading individual stocks. Sign up if you‚Äôre with me.
Donald Trump is a walking conflict of interest. My plan requires presidents and vice-presidents to put their businesses into a blind trust to be sold off. And we‚Äôll automatically release the tax returns of all federal candidates and officeholders. Sign up now if you‚Äôre with me.
Our government works great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not for everyone else. That‚Äôs corruption, plain and simple ‚Äì and I‚Äôve got a comprehensive plan to fight back. Sign up if you‚Äôre ready to put power back in the hands of the people.
The energy of our grassroots supporters keeps me going. This is our moment in history to dream big, fight hard, and win.

The wealthy and well-connected haven't just scooped up a huge chunk of the wealth all of us have worked hard to produce‚Äîthey‚Äôve also gobbled up opportunity itself. But this is America. We should invest in opportunities for everyone.  
Throughout our history, Americans have been told that it wasn‚Äôt possible to make big, structural change. But they didn‚Äôt give up. They built grassroots movements‚Äîand they changed the course of American history. I believe we can do it again. Thank you, New York.  
Women workers sounded the alarm about working conditions for years before the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, but corruption stopped reforms. Look at any big problem we face today‚Äîclimate change, gun safety, health care‚Äîand you can see the same system at work.  
Thank you, New York City! Let‚Äôs dream big, fight hard, and win.  
Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh. But our problems didn't start with Donald Trump. A country that elects Donald Trump is already in serious trouble.  
This is our moment in history. Our moment to dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020. But Democrats can‚Äôt win if we‚Äôre scared and looking backward. If you‚Äôre ready to join this fight, chip in $3 to our grassroots campaign.  
We win when we meet the moment. We win when we stand up for what is right. And we win when we get out there and fight for it. If you‚Äôre ready to fight, join me:  
2020 is about the direction America goes, not just for four years, but for generations to come. There‚Äôs a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else. 
Corruption has put our planet at risk. Corruption has broken our economy. And corruption is breaking our democracy. I know what‚Äôs broken, I‚Äôve got a plan to fix it, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for President of the United States. 
When you see a government that works great for those with money and connections and doesn‚Äôt work much for anyone else, that‚Äôs corruption‚Äîplain and simple. It‚Äôs time to call it out for what it is. 
Join us live from Washington Square Park tonight as I share the story of how working women organized to change the course of history‚Äîand how we can make the big, structural change our future depends on.  
Honored to have you sing the National Anthem at today‚Äôs event. Together, we‚Äôre going to build a better future for your family and for every immigrant family living in this country.

What cheering in the Quiet Car looks like. Thanks 
Tonight, Elizabeth will deliver a speech on how corruption in Washington has allowed the rich and powerful to grow richer and more powerful. RSVP to join her in Washington Square Park! 
Grateful for endorsement today. Together, we're going to make the big, structural change we need so that government works for all of us‚Äînot just the wealthy and well-connected. 
Together, we can root out the corruption in Washington. We can make big, structural changes that will restore our trust in government. And when I‚Äôm President, that‚Äôs exactly what I plan to do.
That‚Äôs not all. I've also released plans to make sure that no president is above the law, to tackle defense contractor coziness at the Pentagon, and to expand oversight, transparency, and enforcement for all contractors hired by the federal government.
We'll fix our criminal laws to make sure we can hold corrupt officials accountable. And we'll ensure that our federal agencies and courts work for the people. That includes holding our federal judiciary‚Äîincluding the Supreme Court‚Äîto the highest ethical standards.
We'll end lobbying as we know it, strengthening our lobbying laws and helping to break the grip that lobbyists have on our government. The voices of corporations and powerful interests shouldn‚Äôt be the only voices influencing government‚Äîbut that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happened.
We'll start by strengthening public integrity rules for federal officials in every branch of government, rooting out financial conflicts of interest, and slamming shut the revolving door between government and industry.
My plan lays out the most sweeping set of anti-corruption reforms since Watergate‚Äînearly one hundred proposals. The goal is simple: Take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected and put it back where it belongs‚Äîin the hands of the people.
But these problems didn‚Äôt start with Trump. On issue after issue, widely popular policies are blocked because corporations and billionaires use their money and influence to stop any progress. To fix it, we‚Äôll need big, structural change to fundamentally transform our government.
The Trump administration is the most corrupt of our lifetimes. Trump is a walking conflict of interest, and many of his cabinet secretaries are no better. His Supreme Court Justices were hand-picked by right-wing extremist groups, and some of his donors are now ambassadors.
In 2019, just 17% of Americans trusted government to do the right thing. Why? Because our government works great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not for everyone else. That‚Äôs corruption, plain and simple‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan to fight back. 
Auto workers deserve good wages, comprehensive benefits, and economic security. I stand with as they strike to get what they deserve, and urge GM to come to the table and negotiate in good faith.

This is appalling. We must use every tool at our disposal to end the HIV epidemic. That means funding research, reducing transmission rates, and ensuring that those living with HIV get the care that they need.

 The basic profit model of an insurance company is to bring in as much money as they can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage. We like our doctors and our nurses‚Äîbut I've never met anyone who actually likes their insurance company.
My friend has "good" health insurance, but it's not nearly enough. Every month, he has thousands of dollars in medical bills that his insurer won't cover. His wife Rachael spends hours every week arguing with their insurer. That's time she can't spend with Ady. 
Our Social Security system should value the work of caregiving. My plan updates outdated rules to raise benefits for caregivers‚Äîon top of immediately increasing Social Security benefits by $200 a month for everyone. 
The system is working great for giant pharmaceutical companies, but not so great for everyone who needs prescription drugs. I've got a few plans to fix that. 
I absolutely believe we can make big, structural changes to tackle the gun violence epidemic head on. If we turn our heartbreak and our anger into action, we can take the power from the NRA and the lawmakers in its pocket and return it to the people.

Today's Social Security benefits are too small to give retirees financial stability, and the situation is even more dire for Americans who haven‚Äôt retired yet. So today I called for the biggest, most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly 50 years. 
Under my plan, all Social Security beneficiaries will receive at least $200 more per month. And every future beneficiary will see at least a $200-a-month increase, whether you're 60 or 20 years old. Click here to see how your Social Security benefits will increase under my plan.
Right now, the rich contribute a far smaller portion of their income to Social Security than everyone else. My plan would require the rich to pay their fair share and increase benefits for every current and future Social Security beneficiary. Sign up now if you‚Äôre with me.

Trump's trade war has cost us 300,000 jobs and is driving us closer to an economic crash‚Äîbut we‚Äôve still got time to stop it. We need a real plan to save our economy, and I've got one. 
Let‚Äôs be clear: The wealthiest 0.1% haven't been paying their fair share. I'm not going to let them rig the system for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. This isn‚Äôt about winning or losing. My  will level the playing field for everyone. 
Everyone deserves a decent retirement. Try my new retirement calculator to see how much your Social Security benefits would increase under my plan: 
Another big benefit: My plan will increase economic growth in the long term and reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next ten years.
So how will we pay for this? Easy. We can immediately increase Social Security benefits and extend the program‚Äôs solvency by nearly two decades by asking the top 2% of families to contribute their fair share to the program.
Those who face work and pay discrimination, like women and caregivers, low-income workers, people of color, and people with disabilities, have lower benefits in retirement. I'll update outdated Social Security rules to ensure everyone gets fairer benefits.
For the 63 million Americans who count on Social Security‚Äîincluding the 10 million Americans with disabilities and their families‚Äîmy plan will provide more economic security. Money to see the doctor or do necessary home repairs.
My plan would immediately increase Social Security benefits by $200 a month‚Äî$2,400 a year‚Äîfor every current and future Social Security beneficiary in America. This would immediately lift around 4.9 million seniors out of poverty and cut the senior poverty rate by nearly 70%.
Social Security has become the main source of retirement income for most seniors, but the benefits today are quite small. 14% of seniors live in poverty‚Äîanother 28% of seniors are close to it. Seniors are cutting pills and skipping meals to save money. This is unacceptable.
It‚Äôs getting harder for families to save enough for a decent retirement. A generation of stagnant wages and rising costs for basics like housing and health care have squeezed family budgets. Millions of Americans are sacrificing saving for retirement just to make ends meet.
We face a retirement crunch that's only going to get worse unless we take bold action. I've got a plan to provide the biggest increase in Social Security benefits in decades‚Äîan immediate $200-a-month increase for everyone.

I love these! Always grateful to work with talented artists on 
 But that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre gonna keep fighting for  families like yours and mine. Thank you for opening up your home to me and asking these important questions. We‚Äôre in this fight together.
 Exactly. I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the top reasons is the cost of health care. After my daddy had a heart attack, we lost the family station wagon, and we nearly lost the house.
 Insurance companies. Right now, the system is working great for them. They pull in as many dollars as they can in premiums, and pay out as few dollars as possible for health care. You know firsthand how difficult this system can be even for people with good insurance.
 It looks like  Our current system works great for the insurance companies making big profits, but not for the families who have to fight them to get the health care they need. Big, structural change means fighting for a system that works for all of us.
My friend understands firsthand how our current health care system is failing patients and their families. I‚Äôm honored to be fighting alongside him for  
I took the Foundation‚Äôs Upstander Pledge, because it's time to build a country that works for all of us‚Äîand there‚Äôs no place for bullying or cruelty in this fight. 
 It‚Äôs true!
 You‚Äôre doing incredible work. Let‚Äôs elect even more moms up and down the ballot!
 Every candidate can offer their policy solution to health care. But we‚Äôre not doing justice to patients unless we talk about‚Ä¶
The gun violence epidemic is growing worse because our nation is being held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists who block any bill. We don't need Trump's half-baked schemes that falsely blame mental illness. Stand up to the gun lobby. 
Stephen Smith is building a people-powered movement to take back the power from corporate executives, lobbyists, and politicians who put their own interests ahead of everyone else. West Virginia can't wait any longer for big, structural change. I'm proud to endorse

Thousands of Ohio patients will be cut off from reproductive health care because of Republicans‚Äô attacks. We have to fight back. Congress must pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care. And I've got a plan for that.  
The people of Texas‚Äô 28th district deserve a Democrat who will be on the side of working people. is that fighter. She knows that when we‚Äôre unapologetic about our values and who we‚Äôre in this fight for, we win. I'm proud to endorse her!

 Greetings from   is in NYC this weekend dreaming big and werking hard. 
Everyone should own a piece of our democracy. At the  convention, I talked about how we‚Äôre building a grassroots movement.No PACs and giant corporations, just people‚Äîin New Hampshire and all around our country. Let‚Äôs dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020! 
The energy of our grassroots movement‚Äîthat‚Äôs what keeps me going. Thank you for coming out today for the  convention! 
Corruption.Plain and simple.This is why I‚Äôve introduced the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate. 
We must call out these hateful attacks wherever and whenever they happen. LGBTQ+ Americans should be able to live free from fear or discrimination. I‚Äôm fighting for your rights every day. 
That‚Äôs my guy. 
Woo-hoo! Let‚Äôs do this.  
Four auto manufacturers decided to reject Donald Trump‚Äôs rollback of fuel economy standards. Now Trump's using the Justice Department to attack those companies for embarrassing him.That‚Äôs disgraceful. 
Bailey "helped" me with grassroots donor call time yesterday. 
For some candidates, ‚Äúcall time‚Äù means dialing up millionaires and asking for big checks.Not me. Last night, I spent ‚Äúcall time‚Äù thanking supporters and talking with voters. Will you chip in $3 to our grassroots campaign? I might call you to say thanks!

Defense contractor influence is part of why we have a wasteful, unsustainable Pentagon budget. It's corruption, plain and simple. I'll make real cuts, and I've introduced sweeping anti-corruption legislation to limit lobbyist influence at the Pentagon. 
On my first day as president, I will sign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands. And I will ban fracking‚Äîeverywhere.
 Tell your mom it was great chatting with her! Thanks for being a part of this grassroots movement. This is how we‚Äôll win‚Äîtogether.
We need universal free public college and technical school so students can graduate without crushing debt. And I've got a plan to cancel student loan debt for more than 95% of Americans who hold it. Find out how much of your debt my plan would cancel: 
Betsy DeVos's Education Department is denying nearly all applications for the updated Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and making it very difficult to apply for the program at all. It's time to fix this student loan debt crisis once and for all. 
 I‚Äôm sorry I missed you! I‚Äôm grateful down to my toes for everything you‚Äôve done for this grassroots movement.
This is immoral. Our laws and values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. As president, I'll welcome at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term. 
The  isn't just about reducing our emissions. It's also about making sure American workers have good green jobs. My Green Manufacturing Plan will create 1.2 million of those jobs‚Äîgetting us one big step closer to that goal. 
 I absolutely love your designs! Thank you so much‚ÄîI‚Äôm grateful down to my toes.
Mike Pence went out of his way to line the president‚Äôs pockets with taxpayer money by staying at Trump‚Äôs hotel. That has a name: Corruption‚Äîplain and simple.

The fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about light bulbs and cheeseburgers so we don't talk about how 70% of pollution comes from transportation, electricity production, and buildings.I won't be sidetracked‚Äîwe need bold action to fight climate change. 
Undocumented leaders and organizers have done incredible work. Now it's on us to act. We should immediately reinstate DACA‚Äîand then give Dreamers and their families a fair and achievable path to citizenship. 
 Thanks for being on the call and in this fight, Katya!
 No such thing as being ‚Äúuncool.‚Äù Glad I got to meet you both! Grateful down to my toes for your support.
The Amazon fires are accelerating the climate crisis, and indigenous communities are being disproportionately impacted. In the U.S. and around the world, we must fight climate change and protect indigenous lands.  
What the Trump administration has done to these children and their families is cruel and inhumane. We must stop unnecessary detention. 
Farmers want to be stewards of our land and part of the solution to climate change‚Äîand we should be supporting them. That's why my plan will provide farmers with the tools and resources they need to invest in sustainable farming practices. 
The best part of the  was getting to see all of the incredible young activists who built a grassroots movement to make it happen. That's how we'll stop climate change‚Äîby dreaming big, fighting hard, and organizing together! 
The fossil fuel industry wants to keep us arguing about light bulbs and cheeseburgers while 70% of pollution comes from just three industries. We need to focus on creating big, structural change to tackle this climate crisis and the Washington corruption head-on.  
 The  isn‚Äôt only about targets. It‚Äôs about justice. has a plan for that.  
You don‚Äôt get to ruin the air, the water, and the soil for everyone else because it increases your profitability.  
Washington is taking money from fossil fuel industries and big polluters and doing exactly what they want, which is mostly nothing. As long as those guys continue to call the shots, we won‚Äôt be able to make the changes we need. 
I just stepped off the stage at the  In a Warren administration, I‚Äôll fight my heart out for our environment‚Äîfrom ending new fossil leases on public lands to investing $2 trillion in green research.Will you chip in $3 right now? 
I proudly adopted many of plans‚Äîyou go anywhere where there are good plans. The only way we‚Äôre going to make change is by looking everywhere.  
 ‚ÄúI have an aggressive plan to reduce our carbon footprint: By 2028, we don‚Äôt have any more new buildings that have any carb‚Ä¶
How is it that, in a democracy, we can have a handful of corporations that year after year drag in bigger profits while the ocean rises‚Äîand while our children are sick, and people are dying? That is not right, and it‚Äôs happening because Washington is corrupt. 
This is exactly what fossil fuel industries want us to talk about‚Äîthey want to stir up a lot of controversy around your light bulbs, straws, cheeseburgers. But 70% of the pollution comes from three industries. We can set our targets and say no more by 2035. 
You don‚Äôt get to ruin the air, water, and soil for everyone else just to help giant corporations. We have a Washington that works great for the wealthy and well-connected. It‚Äôs just not working for the rest of us. That's corruption, plain and simple. 
Don‚Äôt sit around and tell me what‚Äôs not possible. Look around and tell me what happens if we don‚Äôt make change. 
I have an aggressive plan to reduce our carbon footprint: By 2028, we won‚Äôt have any more new buildings that have any carbon footprint. By 2030, we'll do the same for our cars and trucks. By 2035, we'll do the same for our electricity generation.

Barriers that hamper reentry for formerly incarcerated people‚Äîlike restrictions on occupational licensing‚Äîmake it harder for those who have served their time to find work and fully rejoin their communities. We should remove those barriers.

 provided bold, detailed ideas for how to combat climate change, and his ideas should remain at the center of our agenda. Every candidate for president should adopt his ten-year action plan for 100% clean energy. 
I'm committing an additional $1 trillion to help transition to clean and renewable electricity, zero emission vehicles, and green products for buildings. We'll pay for it by reversing Trump‚Äôs tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and giant corporations. 
Climate change is accelerating, and we are already dealing with the consequences. We're running out of time. Combating climate change will be a top priority when I'm president. 
Ohio lawmakers are bending over backwards to gut renewable energy and energy efficiency standards. This is a dangerous law. We need to act fast to stop climate change, not bail out its biggest culprits. 
Climate change is an existential crisis. We need aggressive action‚Äîand we need it now. Nothing less than a national, grassroots movement will be required. Together, we can make the big, structural change we need to tackle this crisis head-on.
We won‚Äôt solve the climate crisis with a one-size-fits-all approach. That's why I've woven policies tackling climate change throughout many of my plans, from how we approach trade to sustainable agriculture and protecting our public lands. Take a look:

People with low incomes are more likely to be entangled in the criminal justice system, and‚Äîbecause of unreasonably punitive and financially burdensome systems like cash bail‚Äîthey're less likely to make their way out. It's time to end cash bail. 
Surprise, surprise: Another way Trump‚Äôs tax bill turned out to be just another giveaway for his rich buddies. 
This is exactly why fines aren‚Äôt good enough. When executives of major companies knowingly hurt people through criminal negligence, they should face real criminal penalties. 
This is a good start‚Äîbut it's not nearly enough. Walmart can and should do much more. And we need real gun reform, now. 
This is inhumane. Our government must provide those in our care with all the health and sanitary products they need. 
We need strong enforcement of our campaign finance laws ‚Äîand that means a fully functioning Federal Election Commission. 
Thank you, New Hampshire, for letting me spend Labor Day with you! Let‚Äôs dream big, fight hard, and win together. 
I began my campaign in Lawrence, MA, where textile workers‚Äîmostly women, nearly all immigrants‚Äîwent on strike after their pay was cut. They put aside their differences and fought together for a better life. Their fight inspires and moves us today. 
No matter how many times strikers and organizers have been told "it‚Äôs too hard, give up now," they've persisted. When workers organize and fight together, they win‚Äîand they can change America.  
Unions built the middle class‚Äîand unions will rebuild the middle class. If we want more good American jobs, then we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people. I‚Äôm proud to be fighting alongside our unions.  
DoorDash‚Äîrecently caught pocketing tips intended for their drivers‚Äîis joining the fight for a ballot initiative that will allow them to exploit their workers and deny them protections. All Democrats should speak out against this proposed ballot measure.

Gun violence is a public health crisis‚Äîand our country is being held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists. I will break the NRA‚Äôs stranglehold on Congress and sign comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation within my first 100 days. 
My thoughts are with the people of the Bahamas today as they face  Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina: Be prepared, make sure you have an emergency plan, and stay safe. 
I'm heartsick for the victims of this latest mass shooting in Odessa and Midland. We shouldn't have to live with this near daily fear and horror. We've already lost far too many to gun violence‚ÄîCongress must act now. 
Uber and Lyft are prepared to spend millions so they can continue classifying their workers as "independent contractors" to exploit them and deny them protections. The California Senate must pass AB 5, and all Democrats should fight this ballot measure. 
I will nominate a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher‚ÄîBetsy DeVos need not apply.

Trump is lying about his calls with China because his trade war is failing, and he's scrambling. We need a real plan to fix our economy before there‚Äôs another downturn. I‚Äôve got one.  
I'm not going to let giant corporations dictate America's trade policy anymore. I'll make sure our trade policies create and defend good American jobs and raise wages‚Äîand that unions and labor will have a seat at the negotiating table. 
As he tries to compensate for his own mishandling of the economy, Donald Trump appears to be floating a tax giveaway that would go almost entirely to the wealthy. He has no plan except more looting to reward his rich buddies.

My plan to protect our democracy would put an end to this kind of voter suppression. No more registration problems. No more voter purges. And no more letting states make it even more difficult for historically disenfranchised populations to vote. 
This has to stop. Politicians are supposed to compete over how many young voters they can turn out, not how many they can keep from the polls. 
If we want to fix the criminal justice system, we have to listen to those who have been directly impacted by it. I was proud to sit down with I‚Äôm ready to fight alongside them.

After release from prison, people are more likely to be unemployed, more likely to be rearrested, and more likely to overdose. Why? In part, because our prisons are not fulfilling their rehabilitative function. I talked with about my plan to change that.

It is our responsibility now to carry on the fight for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. We must continue the work‚Äîtoday and every day‚Äîfor social, racial, and economic justice. 
I'm particularly concerned that Trump is pulling millions of dollars from FEMA to detain more immigrants and implement his administration‚Äôs inhumane immigration policies. This is a cruel, dangerous move‚Äîespecially at the height of hurricane season. 
As Dorian heads towards Puerto Rico, the Trump administration must be prepared to provide assistance and resources. Puerto Rico is still suffering the effects of last season's hurricanes. Now is not the time for insults, delays, or playing politics. Lives and homes are at risk.

We need a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote‚Äîand we need to take action now to put a stop to racist voter suppression. I‚Äôve got a plan for that. 
The 19th Amendment enshrined a woman's right to vote in the Constitution, but the right to vote for women of color wasn't protected until the Voting Rights Act in 1965. In 2013 the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, and voter suppression is on the rise.

As part of my plan to combat the opioid crisis, I'll invest $100 billion for prevention, treatment, and recovery services in the states and communities on the front lines of this crisis. It's time to treat this epidemic like the public health crisis it is. 
Under my Corporate Executive Accountability Act, executives of major companies that knowingly hurt people through criminal negligence‚Äîsuch as fueling the opioid crisis‚Äîwill face real criminal penalties for their actions. 
It's encouraging to see held responsible for their role in fueling the opioid crisis, but this penalty is much smaller than the harm they've done‚Äîor the money they made. We need more accountability, and more resources to fight this crisis. 
I don‚Äôt want a government that works for giant corporations. I want one that works for our families.
I never get tired of these!

 We sent Atticus out into our Los Angeles Town Hall to ask supporters why they‚Äôre ready to vote for his Gammy, htt‚Ä¶
Donald Trump is a walking, talking conflict of interest. No president should be allowed to push the rules of our government to benefit their personal bottom line. My anti-corruption bill‚Äîthe biggest since Watergate‚Äîtackles this kind of corruption head on. 
Art Ramalho was an icon, not just in the boxing world, but in the fight for change. It was an honor to work with him during our 2012 campaign. He taught me how to be a fighter. Thinking about him and his loved ones today.
Two years ago the Burmese military began a campaign that killed thousands of Rohingya and forced over 700,000 people to flee their homes. Today and every day we must stand up for the Rohingya, for reconciliation and  accountability in Burma, and for human rights around the world.

 So good to see you, Randi‚Äîwe‚Äôll get a real selfie next time!
Great job, Atticus! 
Right now in America, working people are getting squeezed. Wages have barely budged for a generation, but the cost of housing, health care, and education is rising. It's time to level the playing field. I‚Äôm running for president to make our government work for the people again.
My plan for immigration reform will end unnecessary detention‚Äîbut I‚Äôll also enforce strict standards for medical care for anyone in our custody. The government has a basic responsibility to keep the people in its care safe and healthy. 
At least three children held in U.S. custody have already died of the flu. This is cruel and inhumane‚Äîand it will lead to more preventable deaths. 
Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us‚Äîand we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a 
Donald Trump has no strategy or plan. His reckless actions drove his own companies into bankruptcy‚Äînow they threaten the global economy and increase the risk of a recession that will hit working families hardest. 
I believe down to my bones that we can make our government work for the people. It‚Äôs the fight of our lives‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not afraid, because we‚Äôre in it together. 
There was a lot of energy at our town hall in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Day by day, community by community, we‚Äôre building a movement together.

 Great meeting you, Sarah! Thanks for being in this fight.
Yup. The time for small ideas is over. We‚Äôve got to be the party of big, structural change. 
‚ÄúStudent loan debt.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs an answer I get a lot when I‚Äôm talking to voters about why they‚Äôre in this fight with me. If we turn my plan to cancel student debt and make public college free into action, we can free an entire generation of Americans.

The  is still burning, with thousands of acres of wildlife in flames. World leaders must come together to end this crisis‚Äîand President Bolsonaro must step up and take responsibility for these fires and their consequences.

Every single day of this campaign matters. As Democrats, we have to be willing to get out there and fight for our country. No more defense‚Äîwe need to play offense and be the party of big, structural change.
Black women are more likely to be breadwinners for their families, yet they‚Äôre paid less on average. That‚Äôs just wrong. We have a lot of work to do to close that pay gap‚Äîand I‚Äôm in this fight all the way. 
It should be quick and easy for anyone to join a union, including graduate student workers. I stand with student workers at and at universities across the country who want to unionize. Their voices must be heard.
My granddaughter Lavinia helped me welcome the crowd last night at our Los Angeles town hall. I love being her Gammy and sharing this fight with my family. 
Every kid should know that when they fight from the heart, they can win‚Äîand that includes running for president. And we pinky promise so they won‚Äôt forget. 
We need to do everything we can to support ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù workers. It‚Äôs time for all Democrats to support AB 5 and back full employee status for gig workers.

Yay! Thank you Los Angeles, and thank you Laura and Kelly! 
Climate change is an existential crisis we all face‚Äîand it‚Äôs going to take big, structural change to solve it. I can‚Äôt wait to talk about my plans to protect our planet and tackle climate change at the Climate Crisis Town Hall next month! 
 I loved her cardigan! Thank you both for coming out last night, it was wonderful to meet you.
Surprise, surprise. Donald Trump and his administration are rolling back regulations for their Wall Street big bank buddies. The rich and powerful are tilting the rules to work in their favor, putting everyone else at risk.That ends when I‚Äôm president.
For decades, the government has helped perpetuate the systemic discrimination that has denied women of color equal opportunities. It‚Äôs time for us to right those wrongs‚Äîand boost our economy in the process.  
Our punitive system does little to keep us safer‚Äîand it is separating families and devastating entire communities. If we want real justice in this country, we have to make big, structural changes to reform the criminal justice system. 
For the exact same crimes, Black Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, charged, wrongfully convicted, and given harsher sentences. The evidence is clear that there are structural race problems in the criminal justice system.  
I hope to see you there! Chip in any amount to our 100% grassroots-funded campaign, and you‚Äôll be automatically entered to win.  
America‚Äôs public lands are our greatest treasures. But the Trump administration is selling them off to oil and gas companies for pennies on the dollar. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way‚Äîand I have a plan to clean up their mess:  
Trans immigrants like Zuleika‚Äîand other vulnerable asylum seekers‚Äîface unimaginable risks while the Trump administration forces them to wait in Mexico. My immigration plan ensures they'll be safely and humanely welcomed at ports of entry.

Our criminal justice system is stacked against Tera‚Äôs family. She worries her brothers won‚Äôt be able to break the cycle of incarceration. We must end cash bail, invest in public defenders and mental health treatment, and help formerly incarcerated people succeed.

The Flores agreement mandates that migrant children cannot be held in detention for more than 20 days. Today, the Trump administration announced its plans to roll back Flores‚Äîputting thousands of children in danger. We must fight this. 
I've argued for years that corporate capture of the federal courts is a serious problem. It's getting worse. The next president must address it‚Äîand that starts by committing to dramatically increase the professional diversity of the federal bench.

Washington is failing Native communities, and it's time to fulfill our obligations to Tribal Nations. Deeply grateful for the opportunity to speak at  yesterday. 
 Great meeting you and your sister, Rachel. Persist!
 Looking great!
I stand with Trump administration‚Äôs gag rule is a deliberate attempt to keep providers like Planned Parenthood from serving patients‚Äîand an attack on women with low incomes who depend on them to get the care they need. We‚Äôll fight this. 
Our system is the result of choices we‚Äôve made‚Äîchoices that together stack the deck against the poor and the disadvantaged. We can create real law and order and real justice in our country by making long overdue big, structural change.
The majority of people in prison will be returned to their communities. We should ensure that returning citizens have a chance to succeed, by reducing discrimination and promoting opportunity during reentry and eliminating needlessly punitive parole requirements.
As we fight to end mass incarceration, we need to ensure humane conditions for those who are imprisoned. That means meeting basic human rights standards, protecting vulnerable populations, investing in rehabilitation programs, and expanding mental health and addiction treatment.
The president can grant clemency and pardons herself. I'll empower a clemency board to make recommendations directly to the White House, identifying broad classes of potentially-deserving individuals for review, such as those serving mandatory minimums that should be abolished.
Our criminal system places enormous power in the hands of the state, and we need better checks in place to ensure that it's just: by investing in our public defenders, reining in prosecutorial abuses, and allowing those wrongfully imprisoned to challenge their conviction.
Officers who violate someone's constitutional rights are often shielded from civil rights lawsuits by qualified immunity. That‚Äôs wrong‚Äîand needs to change. When an officer abuses the law, that‚Äôs bad for law enforcement, victims, and communities.
Most police officers sign up so they can protect their communities. But too many people of color have experienced trauma at the hands of law enforcement. It‚Äôs time to change how we police: funding what works, and building trust between police and the communities they serve.
We also have to stop criminalizing poverty. As president, I will fight to end cash bail and limit excessive fines and fees. There‚Äôs no justice in imposing high, punitive financial burdens on those who are least able to bear them.
Next, we have to rethink what we choose to criminalize. That starts with repealing the 1994 crime bill‚Äîthe bulk of which needs to go‚Äîand legalizing marijuana. Overcriminalization has filled prisons and devastated communities‚Äîand it's time for it to end.
Investing in public safety should mean investing in good schools, safe housing, access to mental health services and treatment for addiction, protecting LGBTQ+ Americans, and violence intervention programs diverting young people from criminal activity‚Äîbefore police are involved.
Let's start by reimagining how we talk about public safety. It's a false choice to suggest a tradeoff between safety and mass incarceration. Instead of putting people in prison, we should focus on services that lift people up and make our communities safer.
The U.S. makes up 5% of the world's population, but nearly 20% of the world's prison population. And the evidence is clear that there are structural race problems in our criminal justice system. At every level, the system disadvantages or discriminates against people of color.
The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world‚Äîyet our harshly punitive system isn‚Äôt making our communities safer. I've got a plan to make big, structural changes at every step of the criminal justice system: 
Here‚Äôs the bottom line: If Dimon and the Business Roundtable are serious about their statement, we need to see real action. They can start by empowering workers and supporting my Accountable Capitalism plan. 
Another question: Dimon and the Business Roundtable have been busy lobbying for NAFTA 2.0. Will they change their tune now and back American workers and unions who are fighting for a better agreement? 
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, leads the group that put out yesterday's statement. Will he put his money where his mouth is and actually raise pay for workers instead of spending billions on stock buybacks for shareholders? 
A year ago, I called out CEOs and the Business Roundtable for their single-minded focus on maximizing shareholder value at the expense of workers. Looks like they finally got the memo. But without real action, their announcement is meaningless. 
Thank you to everyone who came out to our St. Paul town hall this evening! Minnesota is ready to fight for big, structural change. 
Today at the  presidential forum, and I talked about our new proposal: The Honoring Promises to Native Nations Act. Our federal government owes Native communities a fighting chance to build stronger communities and brighter futures. 
 Minnesota is fired-up for 
Where our country spends its money tells you about our values. That‚Äôs why full funding for tribal infrastructure, education, and health care is at the heart of my ideas for Indian Country.  
A problem not seen is a problem not fixed. We must raise awareness and tackle the ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. My administration will launch an unprecedented initiative to collect data, empower Tribal Nations, and address this crisis. 
Proud to fight alongside you, 
Our federal government must recognize its ongoing failure to honor its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. Proud to work alongside on a proposal to uphold the federal government‚Äôs promises to Tribal Nations and empower Native communities. 
I've got a plan to make sure that no president is above the law: Pass a law clarifying Congress‚Äôs intent that the Department of Justice can indict the President of the United States. If you agree, add your name now.

I‚Äôm deeply grateful for the opportunity to participate in  forum this morning. It‚Äôs time for Tribal Nations to have the resources they need to see the prosperity they deserve. 
Glad to see some justice for Eric Garner and his family. But Daniel Pantaleo should have been fired a long time ago. And our criminal justice system needs big, structural change.

The CFPB student loan ombudsman is supposed to protect students from getting cheated. But the Trump administration‚Äôs pick for the job is an executive at a student loan servicer that got over 9,000 complaints from borrowers. In my administration, the CFPB will work for the people.

Woo-hoo! See you in September, 
This is wonderful. Thank you so much, 
Ayanna and I are running for president, because that‚Äôs what girls do.

The Line 3 pipeline would threaten Minnesota‚Äôs public waters, lands, and agricultural areas important to several Tribal Nations. I‚Äôm with and Minnesota organizers fighting to  and protect our environment.
We're having these important conversations everywhere‚Äîin parks, in grocery stores, on farms and at the corner store! And now we're making sure you can organize everywhere, too. I hope you'll sign up for this training and join us on Reach! 
 Today released an extremely comprehensive plan for honoring and empowering indigenous people ; tribal nations.T‚Ä¶
Wells Fargo forced Xavier to close out his accounts, yet he was still hit with over $1,000 worth of overdraft fees. It‚Äôs not right. I‚Äôve been fighting for years to hold Wells Fargo accountable, and I‚Äôm not going to stop until they clean up their act. 
I'm speaking live at now about the big, structural change we're fighting for. Tune in! 
It‚Äôs an honor to fight alongside and to end gun violence. 
With a North Country view like this, you‚Äôd move fast too. 
We‚Äôre in this fight together‚Äîfor our children, for our communities, and for our future.

 You‚Äôve got this. Good luck!
I‚Äôm proud to team up with on our new bill to uphold our responsibilities to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples and provide them with predictable, guaranteed funding. 
Proud to fight alongside every day. 
We must stand united with Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples to ensure that Native voices are heard and their rights are respected. With real structural change, we can write a new story. 
 Thank you, It‚Äôs an honor to fight alongside you.
Washington owes Native communities a fighting chance to build stronger communities and a brighter future. I have put forward a set of proposals to recommit our government to its promises to Tribal Nations indigenous peoples. I hope you‚Äôll read my whole proposal here.
To everyone who gives me letters at town halls: Thank you! These came from the people of Nevada after our Henderson town hall. I love reading about what gets you in this fight‚Äîwe‚Äôre in it together. 
I got a lot of letters to read at our first-ever town hall in Arizona. Your stories inspire me to keep fighting. And yes, Casey: I‚Äôll give Bailey an extra pet for you! 
I‚Äôve fought for a brighter future for Tribal Nations during my time in the Senate and I‚Äôm proud to work with on our new bill in Congress. And when we win the White House, I‚Äôll be committed to achieving that future as President of the United States.
Right-wing courts have ruled that religious freedom laws allow corporations to deny employees birth control, but don‚Äôt protect tribes that object to dumping sewage water on sacred sites. Absurd. Congress should pass a new law protecting tribal religious interests in sacred sites.
When tribal concerns have conflicted with corporate profits or resource extraction, tribes lose. This has to change. When I‚Äôm president, energy projects that impact Indian Country won‚Äôt proceed without consent. That means revoking Trump‚Äôs KeystoneXL and DAPL permits.
In 2013, the Violence Against Women Act crucially recognized some criminal jurisdiction by Tribal Nations, and I support reauthorizing and building on it. But we need to go further and I support a full Oliphant fix.
Washington has refused to fully respect tribal sovereignty in criminal justice matters. This has deprived countless crime victims the opportunity to get justice. And it has fed the ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. This must change. 
Funding critical programs for Indian Country isn't optional. It's required to fulfill the United States‚Äô trust and treaty obligations. So and I have teamed up on writing a bill to ensure predictable, guaranteed funding to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples.
Washington is failing Native communities, and it's time to fulfill our obligations to Tribal Nations. Today I‚Äôm announcing ideas to ensure that tribal sovereignty and our trust and treaty obligations are binding legal and moral principles‚Äînot just slogans. 
Last month, the FTC tweeted and advertised that the nearly 150 million Americans who had their data exposed in the breach were eligible for $125 each in compensation.Now they‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúJust kidding!‚Äù I‚Äôm demanding answers.

I love the North Country! Grateful to everyone who came out to our Franconia town hall yesterday. From ending the opioid epidemic to leveling the playing field for rural workers, I‚Äôm in this fight for the people of New Hampshire. 
Heartsick to hear that anti-LGBTQ+ violence increased during Pride Month. Hate and homophobia should have no place here in America. Now is the time to get in this fight for a country where LGBTQ+ Americans can live without fear.
The gap between white and Black homeownership rates today is about 30% ‚Äî bigger than it was in 1960 when housing discrimination was legal. This enormous gap is a moral stain on our country, and my housing plan tackles it head on.

Under a Warren administration, I will take executive action to ensure fair pay and benefits for all workers. Federal contractors will be required to extend a $15 minimum wage and benefits to all employees.

My plan for a new farm economy tackles this ugly history and levels the playing field for farmers of color. As president, I‚Äôll end the policies that have perpetuated this dispossession and strengthen oversight of USDA to root out discrimination for good.

Trump‚Äôs  policy makes it harder for immigrants who rely on government services to get permanent legal status. Families shouldn't be forced to choose between staying in our country ; having access to basic health care ; housing. As president, I'd overturn this rule. 
We‚Äôre going to win in 2020 by getting organized at the grassroots level‚Äîlike at our house party in Des Moines on Sunday. Democracy starts in our backyards!

I had a terrific time at the yesterday! What happens in 2020 is going to determine the direction of our country for generations to come‚Äîand Iowa is right at the heart of it.  
When I‚Äôm president, I will send Congress comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation and sign it into law within my first 100 days. And we will revisit that legislation every single year based on new data to continually reduce the number of gun deaths in America. 
Over fifty years, comprehensive safety measures reduced per-mile driving deaths by almost 80% and prevented 3.5 million automobile deaths. We have to do the same for gun deaths‚Äîand I have a plan for that.
I was honored to join activists, organizers, and community leaders at today's  And I‚Äôm ready to fight alongside them for big, structural change to tackle our gun violence epidemic. Here‚Äôs how:  
 Hey there, üëã
Increasing taxes on gun manufacturers will reduce gun and ammunition sales and bring in new federal revenue that we can use for both gun violence prevention and enforcement of existing gun laws. Together, we can hold gun manufacturers accountable.
Thank you to everyone who came out to the Iowa State Fair to talk, share your concerns, and grab a selfie. I had a fantastic day! 
Fun night at the dinner! Grateful for the opportunity to talk about my plans to make our government work for the people of Iowa. 
It's past time to turn our heartbreak and anger into action. We need to take power from the NRA and corrupt lawmakers and return it to the people. 
Thank you, Together we can end the gun violence epidemic and make our country safer for everyone. 
 Elizabeth Warren has laid out her plan to address gun violence, with an ambitious goal for her presidency if she wins in 2020:‚Ä¶
Mass shootings capture our attention, but they‚Äôre just the tip of the iceberg of gun violence in America. Every day, we lose one hundred Americans to gun violence, with countless more injured and traumatized. My plan makes big changes to address all kinds of gun violence.

Congress should again ban the future production, sale, and importation of military-style assault weapons. We also need a federal ban on large-capacity magazines for all firearms.
If a license is required to drive a car, it should be required to own a gun. Congress should establish a similar system for the purchase of any type of firearm or ammunition.

The NRA spends millions poisoning our political discourse with hateful, conspiracy-fueled propaganda. From the White House, I‚Äôll make sure that the NRA and their cronies are held accountable with executive action.
As president, I will immediately take executive action to rein in an out-of-control gun industry. I will act to require background checks for the vast majority of private gun sales, and Congress should permanently require universal background checks.
The next president has a moral obligation to use whatever executive authority she has to address the gun crisis. We will require background checks for the majority of private gun sales, reporting on bulk purchases, and raise the minimum age to buy a gun.

The dialogue about gun violence in America is shifting, thanks to the work of activists, organizers, community leaders, and survivors. It's time to turn our heartbreak and anger into action, and take power from the NRA and corrupt lawmakers and return it to the people.
And we'll revisit this legislation every year‚Äîadding new ideas and tweaking existing ones‚Äîto keep reducing the number of gun deaths in America. My budget will invest $100 million for DOJ and HHS to study gun violence, evaluate the reforms we pass, and suggest new ones.
We have to chart a new path, and that starts with investing in evidence-based community violence intervention designed to stop gun violence before it occurs. As president, I‚Äôll establish a grant program to invest in and pilot intervention programs at scale.
Black and Latinx Americans have borne the brunt of the gun violence tragedy. But after being traumatized by gun violence, these communities have been doubly victimized by increased policing and strict sentencing laws.
In addition to ending the special legal immunity gun manufacturers have now, Congress should hold manufacturers strictly liable for gun-related injuries and give victims of gun violence a private right of action to recover compensatory damages from manufacturers.
This legislation will ensure that safe, responsible ownership is the standard for everyone who chooses to own a gun. We'll create a federal licensing system, require universal background checks, establish a real waiting period, and cap firearms purchases.
I will send Congress comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation and sign it into law within my first 100 days.
My administration will also protect survivors of domestic abuse by closing the "boyfriend loophole." And we'll reverse the Trump administration's efforts to weaken gun safety, including rules that enabled 3-D printed guns and make it easier to create untraceable weapons.
We'll require background checks for the vast majority of private gun sales, including at gun shows and online. We'll extend the existing requirements on reporting bulk gun sales. And we'll raise the minimum age for purchasing a gun.
From the White House, I will take executive action to rein in an out-of-control gun industry. Gun manufacturers make billions by knowingly selling deadly products, and it‚Äôs time to hold gun dealers and manufacturers accountable for the violence promoted by these products.
In 2017, almost 40,000 people died from guns in the U.S. My goal is to reduce that number by 80%. We‚Äôll start with solutions we believe will work. We‚Äôll update those solutions based on new research‚Äîand stop corrupt extremists from blocking action by ending the filibuster.
It‚Äôs easy to despair when our government refuses to act. But we are not incapable of solving big problems. Over fifty years ago, we took big steps to make our cars safer and since then, we reduced per-mile driving deaths by almost 80% and prevented 3.5 million automobile deaths.
The statistics are horrifying. Our firearm homicide rate is 25x higher than other comparable countries. Our firearm suicide rate is nearly 10x higher. Women are 21x more likely to be shot to death‚Äîmost killed by an intimate partner. 21 children and teenagers are shot every day.
Gun violence is a public health crisis. That‚Äôs why I have a comprehensive gun violence prevention plan‚Äîa plan to make big, structural changes to end the NRA and corrupt lawmakers‚Äô ability to block our government from defending the lives of our people. 
The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy, if we are going to build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.

I‚Äôm standing with and as they rally this weekend to urge to stop selling guns. I hope you‚Äôll join them. 
Companies that sell guns have a responsibility to the safety of their communities. is one of the largest gun retailers in the world. The weapons they sell are killing their own customers and employees. No profit is worth those lives. Do the right thing‚Äîstop selling guns.
Sometimes, companies recognize that they have an obligation to the lives, health, and safety of their communities. In 2014, for example, CVS voluntarily stopped selling tobacco products. Cigarette sales went down, and more smokers tried to quit. That's progress.
When I first ran for Senate in 2012, my team and I drove from event to event in a bright blue used SUV. It was great‚Äîbut I think driving across Iowa in this takes the cake!

 Thank you, Sarah! I‚Äôm grateful to have you in this fight. That‚Äôs how this is going to work: You, me, and this grassroots movement are all in this together.
I'm grateful down to my toes for all the meaningful conversations we're having during our Iowa road trip. Thanks for coming out last night, Council Bluffs! 
This is inhumane and will have devastating effects on the children that are left behind. Make no mistake: I'll keep fighting my heart out for our immigrant communities‚Äîand in a Warren administration, immigrant families will be able to live without fear.
Just days after the massacre in El Paso, fueled by anti-immigrant rhetoric, the Trump administration carried out the largest ICE raid in more than 10 years‚Äîseparating families and targeting communities of color. 
This is alarming‚Äîbut there is still time to avert the next economic crash. I've outlined a plan for how to do it. And we need to act now. 
Meanwhile, the potential shocks I identified are looming larger. Trump is escalating his incoherent tariff-by-tweet strategy against China. The chances of a no-deal Brexit have risen. No wonder markets are assessing a high risk of a potential recession. 
New data confirmed other weaknesses too. New Q2 economic data showed slowing growth. There's a slowdown in construction jobs and manufacturing job hours declined. 
We got more confirmation of my concern that middle class families are falling deep into debt trying to bridge the gap between rising household costs and stagnant incomes. 
Two weeks ago I warned about a coming economic downturn. Since then, we've already seen more signs that our economy is in precarious condition and that Trump's rhetoric and actions are pushing us closer to the brink.
Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump won‚Äôt act‚Äîbut we will. Together, we can stand up to the NRA and demand real gun reform to keep our communities safe. 
I‚Äôm inspired by every activist making their voice heard in El Paso today. We are  ready to tackle gun violence and white supremacy head-on.

Farms are being crushed by failed Washington policies and giant agribusinesses, and many rural communities lack access to health care and fast, reliable internet. Our rural communities are being cut off from opportunities to thrive, and I have a plan to fix it. 
I want Washington to work for communities all over the country‚Äîand make sure every community has the resources it needs to thrive. Together, we can make big improvements in the lives of rural Americans.
Agriculture has become one of the biggest polluters in our economy, thanks to decades of failed policy. By paying farmers to fight climate change and investing in R;D we can tackle climate change.
I have plans that will help bring affordable housing, child care, and accessible banking to rural communities. My new approach to trade policy will make sure we're keeping good jobs here in America and giving rural communities a voice in trade negotiations.
A whole bunch of my other plans will help rural communities, too. My plan to cancel student loan debt and provide free public college will help young people build a future in rural communities, instead of driving them to cities to find a job that can pay down their debt.
Here‚Äôs my new approach: Guaranteeing farmers a fair price‚Äîraising farm incomes and reducing taxpayer expenses. We'll pay farmers for sustainable farming that protects our environment and provide consumers with affordable, local food. 
Finally, I've got a plan to overhaul our country's failed approach to the farm economy. For decades, government policy has subsidized industrial agriculture at taxpayers' expense while driving environmentally unsustainable farming practices and starving farmers.
This ends when I‚Äôm president. I'll create a public option for broadband and make sure every home has affordable high-speed internet. I'll crack down on anti-competitive practices and appoint FCC Commissioners who'll restore net neutrality and provide open access to the internet.
One of the best tools to expand access to health care‚Äîand unlock other economic opportunities‚Äîis high-speed internet. But big broadband companies exclude entire communities‚Äîespecially tribal communities and communities of color‚Äîfrom fast, reliable internet access.
I'll also tackle consolidation in health care. If a proposed merger is a first step to closing hospitals or slashing basic services, then a Warren administration will block it. And I'll invest more resources in community health centers and closing today‚Äôs rural doctor shortage.
My plan starts with protecting access to health care in rural communities, which are rapidly losing access to basic services. That's why I support  why I'll increase Medicare reimbursement rates to help rural hospitals stay afloat.
Everyone should have the opportunity to build a good life wherever they live. But as giant corporations and Washington keep cutting off opportunities for huge parts of the country, the shot to succeed gets further out of reach for rural families. I've got a plan to fix that.
I'm kicking off my Iowa road trip today! As we head into Iowa, I'm sharing my new plans to invest in rural communities. It's time to put their interests ahead of giant companies and Wall Street.

I‚Äôve answered over 530 audience questions this year, and the hardest to swallow was from a little boy named Owen in Michigan. He asked, ‚ÄúHow will you keep kids safe at school?‚ÄùNo child should have to go to school fearing for their lives. We must take action on gun violence‚Äînow.

The Senate created the filibuster, and if necessary, the Senate can get rid of the filibuster. We don‚Äôt have to let Mitch McConnell‚Äôs cynical hypocrisy win. Add your name if you agree we can‚Äôt let Republican abuse of the filibuster stop the big, structural change we need.

I just talked to Hunt about how white nationalism is domestic terrorism. And as Donald Trump has made one ugly statement after another, we‚Äôve seen it on the rise. White nationalists embrace him, and the Republicans enable him.Enough.

Trade can be a powerful tool. My plan represents a new approach‚Äîone that uses America‚Äôs leverage to boost American workers and raise the global standard of living. The president has a lot of authority to remake trade policy herself. When elected, I intend to use it.
I‚Äôll end ‚ÄúInvestor-State Dispute Settlement‚Äù‚Äîthe favorable enforcement we offer corporations which they've used to undermine laws that benefit workers ; families (like minimum wage increases). And I‚Äôll create a new, stronger approach to enforcing labor ; environmental standards.
Finally, our approach to enforcing trade deals is driving down standards worldwide. We offer corporations fast and powerful methods to enforce the provisions that benefit them, but make it nearly impossible to enforce labor and environmental protections. It's time to change that.
I'll make combating climate change a key focus of our trade deals‚Äîand make sure America lives up to the same standards we hold other countries to. I'll require countries we negotiate trade deals with to comply with the Paris Climate accord and end fossil fuel subsidies.
I'll also go further to make sure our trade deals ensure consumer safety ; protect America's family farms. And I'll fight to bring down the costs of prescription drugs here ; around the world by supporting price controls ; seeking out opportunities to reduce exclusivity periods.
I'll establish a set of standards that countries must meet as a precondition for any trade agreement: covering labor rights, human rights, religious freedom, human trafficking, protecting the environment, currency practices, and combating tax evasion and bribery.
For too long, we've made trade deals with countries with abysmal records on labor, environmental issues, and human rights. They get concrete access to the American market while we get vague commitments to do better‚Äîwhich we hardly enforce. This must end.
Our trade negotiations give special access to corporate interests before the agreement is rushed through Congress. I'll end this undemocratic, corrupt practice and negotiate and approve trade deals through a transparent process that offers the public a real chance to shape them.
My plan is a whole new approach to trade that will transform every aspect of our current process, from how we negotiate deals, to the negotiating objectives we pursue, to the way we enforce agreements. This isn‚Äôt about tough talk‚Äîit's about big, structural change.
America has enormous leverage in trade negotiations. I won‚Äôt hand that leverage to corporations to boost their own profits‚ÄîI‚Äôll use it to create and defend good American jobs, raise wages, fight climate change, lower drug prices, and raise living standards worldwide.
For decades, America‚Äôs trade policy has put the profits of big multinational corporations ahead of American workers, farmers, and the environment. I have a new approach: Trade on our terms and only when it benefits American families. Here's my plan. 
Yesterday, 4 people were killed and dozens more injured in senseless gun violence attacks in Gilroy and Brooklyn. One of the victims was a 6-year-old child. And these are just the few that made headlines. I‚Äôm heartsick. We have a gun violence epidemic. It‚Äôs our duty to act‚Äînow.

Woo-hoo, thanks for coming out today, New Hampshire! I'm grateful down to my toes that we got to talk about the big, structural change we're fighting for. 
 Thank you so much for your letter, Wade. We‚Äôll keep fighting the good fight, together.
To get serious about climate change and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, we need to end Big Oil‚Äôs stranglehold on Washington. As president, I‚Äôll eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and put a moratorium on new fossil fuel leases offshore or on public lands. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs tweets are ugly and racist. They‚Äôre purposefully designed to turn us against one another. We cannot let that happen. Instead, we must follow my friend Elijah Cummings‚Äô example and keep doing the work for the American people. 
Teaching law at was a dream come true, but incredibly hard while raising two little kids. Lack of high-quality, affordable child care almost sunk me‚Äîuntil Aunt Bee came to help. The fight for  is personal for me. 
Every letter I read gives me yet another reason to keep dreaming big and fighting hard for the big, structural change that Americans everywhere want to see. I‚Äôm grateful down to my bones for your support. 
I‚Äôm running my campaign differently. No federal lobbyists. No fundraisers with mega-donors. No money from PACs of any kind. Instead, I‚Äôm spending my time talking with you. Will you chip in $3 right now? It will go a long way‚Äîand I might call to say thanks! 
Our federal government has underserved HBCUs and MSIs for decades. We need to right these wrongs‚Äîstarting with my plan to invest at least $50 billion in these important institutions. 
Thank you for having me,  
A person‚Äôs HIV status has no bearing on their ability to parent. This is just the latest in a long line of the Trump administration‚Äôs cruel attacks on immigrant communities. I want to be clear here: Families belong together‚Äîno exceptions. 
This is a big win for women who work in politics and for their families. Grateful for leadership in making this possible! Next, let‚Äôs go a step further and make  a reality for everyone. 
The ADA is about civil rights, opportunity, and our values‚Äîbut there‚Äôs more work to be done. As I celebrate the ADA today, I'm committing to continue the fight to protect these rights every step of the way. 
That changed with the passage of the ADA‚Äîwhich came about thanks to activists and leaders in Congress like Rep. Major Owens. It not only helped dismantle prejudices about Americans with disabilities, it recognized their right to live, work, and love independently. 
On the 29th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I‚Äôm thinking about my first job out of college‚Äîteaching students with speech and learning disabilities at a public school. I saw the difficulties my kids faced navigating a world that wasn‚Äôt designed for them. 
The playing field is tilted against entrepreneurs and small business owners of color. A typical Black entrepreneur starts a business with $35,000 in capital‚Äîa third of the startup capital for the typical white entrepreneur. Here‚Äôs how we change that: 
HBCUs have always had to do more with less. Many are in danger of closing, or have already closed. That's why I have a plan to invest at least $50 billion in HBCUs. 
 Wow! I love it.
For black moms in particular, this maternal mortality crisis is an epidemic. I have a plan to hold health systems accountable for protecting them. 
We have the power to prevent these deaths. We need paid leave so that new moms have time to recover‚Äîand we need  so that moms (and their babies!) have access to the health care they need. 
I‚Äôm running a different kind of campaign. Since I don‚Äôt spend my time asking rich donors for big checks, I get to spend it with voters instead. That way everyone can get a selfie! 
Trump's Department of Justice just approved and $26 billion merger. This merger will cost thousands of jobs, reduce wages, and further reduce competition in a sector that badly needs it. We need antitrust regulators with the courage to stand up to monopolies. 
Exciting news: We just passed one million contributions made to our campaign!We‚Äôre 100% grassroots-funded, ; every person who chips in owns a piece of our movement. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful. After Caitlyn made the millionth donation, I called with a double woo-hoo thank you! 
After Wanda, a math teacher, chipped in to our campaign, I gave her a call to say thanks! Teachers see the worth in every human being‚Äîthe guy in the White House doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs up against. 
I'm thrilled to see that the House has passed  If Donald Trump really cared about the plight of the Venezuelan people, he wouldn't be deporting those in the U.S. back to violence and fear. Now I hope my Senate colleagues will pass this bill. 
Racist voter suppression is real‚Äîand we need federal muscle in the fight. Under my plan, there‚Äôll be no more problems with voter registration, no more arbitrary voter purges, and no more gerrymandering. The right to vote is fundamental ; we'll protect it. 
Sandra Pezqueda worked at in Southern California. After reporting sexual harassment, she was fired‚Äîbut her courage launched a movement. I stand in solidarity with Sandra and everyone supporting the Terranea boycott, and you can too: 
The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy, if we are going to build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for all Americans.

I loved our phone call! Our nation‚Äôs future rests with young people‚Äîand we have an obligation to do whatever we can to help you succeed. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me.  
Mueller‚Äôs testimony yesterday confirmed what we already knew: A hostile foreign power attacked our democracy, and we haven‚Äôt done anything to stop it from happening again. That‚Äôs why I have a plan to secure our elections from foreign threats: 
Today, it‚Äôs a different story. An entire generation is being crippled by student debt and skyrocketing tuition costs. My plan to cancel debt for 95% of Americans with student loan debt, make public college free, and invest in HBCUs would end this crisis. 
When I was a senior in high school, my family didn‚Äôt have the money for college application fees‚Äîlet alone a college education. Through a mix of scholarships and part-time jobs, I ended up getting my 4-year degree at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester.  
Our criminal justice system has a long history of mistakes when it comes to capital punishment‚Äîespecially when it comes to Black and Brown people. We cannot let a broken system decide the fate of incarcerated Americans. I oppose the death penalty. 
 It was great meeting you, Tracy! Glad you‚Äôre in this fight.
This is an important step to ensure that non-binary Americans are seen and respected. Way to go, New Hampshire. All states should do the same. 
The people of Puerto Rico have endured so much‚Äîdisaster and tragedy, economic crisis, government corruption, generations of disrespect. I'm inspired by my fellow U.S. citizens and their movement to hold their government accountable. 
I'm running to be the best president that money can't buy, but I can't do it alone. Will you chip in $3 before our July fundraising deadline? One person at a time, we'll stop Washington from answering to billionaires and giant corporations. 
Our government let the student loan debt crisis spiral out of control, especially for people of color. My bill provides a $50 billion investment in HBCUs ; cancels student loan debt for 95% of borrowers‚Äîso that we can begin to close the racial wealth gap. 
 Elizabeth Warren's legislation would provide up to $50,000 of student debt relief for those earning $100,000 or less.

Here‚Äôs the good news: We have the chance to head off another financial crisis if we take action now. 
If we stay the course, the odds of another economic downturn are high‚Äîand growing. If we take bold action now, we can head off another financial crisis before it‚Äôs too late. 
I've got a plan to make sure that no president is above the law: Pass a law clarifying Congress‚Äôs intent that the Department of Justice can indict the President of the United States. If you agree, sign our petition now.
I read the Mueller report the day it came out. Three things were clear: A hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election, Trump welcomed their help, and Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack. I agree with time to begin impeachment proceedings. 
In just a few minutes, I‚Äôll be speaking live at the 110th  I hope you‚Äôll tune in! 
Robert Mueller‚Äôs report is an impeachment referral, and it‚Äôs up to Congress to act. But impeachment shouldn‚Äôt be the only way that a sitting president can be held accountable for committing a crime. No president is above the law. 
I read all 448 pages of the Mueller report, and this much is clear: The president obstructed justice. Attorney General Barr can try to cover it up, but the American people deserve to hear the full truth from Mueller himself. I hope we get that tomorrow. 
It‚Äôs about time. Our 9/11 first responders are American heroes‚Äîthey deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and guaranteed the support they need. 
Thank you for being in this fight, Norelia. Your voice matters.

I'm not taking a dime from Washington lobbyists or PACs of any kind‚Äîbecause this campaign is powered by the people. Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can? Every dollar will help keep up our momentum before next week‚Äôs fundraising deadline. 
Our budget reflects our values, and Trump‚Äôs new budget proposal makes his perfectly clear. The SNAP program helps working families and students keep food on the table. We should expand it‚Äînot cut it.

But we should be wary that this administration doesn't abuse this necessary review in order to pursue its own partisan agenda. This issue is too important to be dragged into Trump's petty grievances against these companies. This requires careful congressional oversight.
Big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google wield enormous, monopolistic power. I've been saying that we need to  for a long time and I support a legitimate antitrust investigation into these companies.

Betsy DeVos is the worst education secretary we‚Äôve ever had. We need someone who will actually fight for our students, which is why I‚Äôve pledged to nominate a former public school teacher to lead in a Warren administration. 
The warning lights are flashing. Whether it‚Äôs this year or next year, the odds of another economic downturn are high. This time, though, we can head it off. Congress and regulators should act immediately.
With an economy this vulnerable, we need to reduce the odds of the potential shocks that can send us into another downturn. That means Congress should eliminate the debt ceiling ; the Trump administration should replace its trade-war-by-tweet with China with a coherent strategy.
We need to strengthen manufacturing by investing in it instead of undercutting it. My Green Manufacturing plan will invest $2 trillion in American green research, manufacturing, and exporting over the next decade, creating more than a million new American jobs.
Next, we have to tackle corporate debt. After the 2008 crisis, Congress created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor market risks. But the Trump-era FSOC is falling down on the job. The FSOC should meet to discuss these risks and announce a plan to address them.
First, we can reduce household debt by raising wages and bringing down household costs. My plans tackle both sides of this problem, from raising the minimum wage to $15 to canceling student debt and making housing more affordable: 
The good news is that we have the chance to head off a crisis, just like we had the chance to head it off in 2008, if we take bold action now to address the underlying problems in our economy. Here's what we need to do:
Our country‚Äôs economic foundation is fragile, and a single shock could bring it all down. Trump's reckless behavior makes that shock more likely. Financial markets and experts agree: We face a serious risk of another recession by the end of 2021‚Äîmaybe even by the end of 2020.
Despite Donald Trump‚Äôs promises of a manufacturing ‚Äúrenaissance,‚Äù the country is now in a manufacturing recession. For the first time ever, the hourly wage for manufacturing workers has dropped below the national average.
Corporations are deeply in debt and taking risky loans, spreading that risk throughout our financial system. These high-risk loans look a lot like pre-2008 sub-prime mortgages: poorly underwritten and with minimal protections, packaged up and sold to investors.
I know it sounds stark, but here's what I see today: Families are taking on more debt than ever, thanks to a generation of stagnant wages and rising costs. Student debt has more than doubled since 2008. More than 30% of American adults have debts in collection right now.
I warned about an economic crash years before the 2008 crisis, but the people in power wouldn‚Äôt listen. Now I‚Äôm seeing serious warning signs again‚Äîand I‚Äôm calling for action before another crisis costs America‚Äôs families their homes, jobs, and savings. 
I had a terrific time with Mike (our ‚ÄúGrab a Beer* With Elizabeth‚Äù contest winner) and his wife, Linda, from Elma, New York! We had beer and iced tea at my house, then grabbed dinner down the street. Bruce had a lot of fun and Bailey got to meet his new friend! 
Ricardo Rossell√≥ must listen to the people of Puerto Rico and resign. 
Cleaning up before meeting some new friends tonight! 
After the big banks crashed our economy, the was the big, structural change our country needed. Now, the Trump administration is on a mission to destroy it. I‚Äôll keep fighting for consumers‚Äîtoday, and as president of the United States.
Today the turns 8! I helped President Obama create an agency that would protect consumers‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly what happened. The CFPB has forced financial companies to return an estimated $12 billion to the people. 
It‚Äôs time to tackle Washington corruption head-on. And yes, I‚Äôve got a plan for that!

The Apollo 11 mission is a perfect reminder that if we dream big enough, fight hard enough, and invest in American ingenuity, we can accomplish incredible things. In fact, we can protect our planet for generations to come.
That's why I‚Äôve proposed a Green Apollo Program to tackle climate change head on, including $400 billion in government funding over the next 10 years for clean energy research and development‚Äîmore than 10 times what we invested in the last 10 years. 
President Kennedy knew that we didn‚Äôt have the technology to achieve this goal at first‚Äîand his commitment spurred a decade of scientific and technological mobilization leading up to the moon landing. To tackle climate change today, we need to make another bold commitment.
Fifty years ago today, our country put Americans on the moon. At first it seemed impossible, but we got it done because our government made bold investments in science, innovation, and American workers.

We need to build a lasting foundation for LGBTQ+ rights so everyone can feel safe to be who they are. I‚Äôm honored to work alongside in this fight.

 You're absolutely right, Charlotte. Your confidence and grace inspires me, and I promise I'll continue fighting every step of the way until every trans American can live their best lives, free of fear and discrimination.
I've been standing with the people of Puerto Rico in their protests against corruption and their governor‚Äôs behavior. The people have spoken‚Äîloud and clear: should resign. 
Big Pharma and corporate greed are root causes of the opioid epidemic. That‚Äôs why I proposed the CARE Act with Rep. Elijah Cummings to hold drug executives accountable and invest in our communities so we can end this crisis.
Private equity firms are destroying our free press. They buy newspapers like the Monterey Herald for cheap, cut the staff, and bleed them dry. My new plan to hold Wall Street accountable would end this looting. 
Thank you for a fantastic night, Sioux City. This is how we‚Äôre going to do it‚Äîtogether. 
Eugene Scalia spent his career putting giant corporations over American workers. This should concern anyone who believes that the Department of Labor should protect workers‚Äô rights‚Äînot corporate interests. The Senate must reject his nomination for Secretary of Labor.

For generations, our government‚Äôs redlining policies prevented Black families from owning a home‚Äîand the effects are still being felt today. My plan for fair housing confronts this racist legacy head on. 
Let‚Äôs be real. Private equity firms are like vampires‚Äîbleeding companies dry and walking away enriched. My new plan reins in these monsters to save our economy. 
That‚Äôs right, Sara. We‚Äôre in this fight together.

For decades, Washington has lived by one rule: If it‚Äôs good for Wall Street, it‚Äôs good for the economy. Today in Sioux City, Iowa, I talked about my new plan to change that rule. 
Wall Street is scared. That‚Äôs why the big banks are building a ‚Äúpolitical machine‚Äù to keep Washington in their vice grip. I‚Äôm fighting back‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a new plan to end Wall Street‚Äôs stranglehold on our economy.

As I head back to Iowa today, I‚Äôm thinking about farmers who have faced extreme flooding and billions in damage to their communities this year. Climate change is real and it‚Äôs here. Here's just one of my plans to make a  a reality:

When I was a kid, a minimum-wage job could support a family of three. Today it won‚Äôt keep a mom and her baby out of poverty. I‚Äôm glad to see the House pass the  to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now the Senate must act.

Students shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about going hungry. Our new bill will help the nearly one in three college students who are food insecure. 
Read this thread. These tactics make a handful of Wall Street managers very rich, but are costing thousands of people their jobs, putting valuable companies out of business, and hurting communities across the country. 
We need a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act that would rebuild the wall between commercial banks and investment banks. If banks want to engage in higher-risk investment banking, they should be forced to bear the full risk of their investment decisions. Sign up now if you agree.
To raise wages, help small businesses, and spur economic growth, we need to shut down the Wall Street giveaways and rein in the financial industry so it stops sucking money out of the rest of the economy. If you want Wall Street to start serving the rest of the economy, sign up.
 against attacks from this racist president, and we should all remember this definition of patriotism. 
Letting financial firms run wild is undermining our economy. I am done with Washington ignoring the evidence and acting as if boosting Wall Street helps families. It's time to stop the looting, boost wages, grow our economy, and rein in Wall Street.
I‚Äôve spent a lot of my career studying how financial firms make money by tricking and trapping families. And after I proposed a new federal agency to protect consumers, I spent nearly a year setting up the and helping write new rules to crack down on financial scams.
Finally, Wall Street sucks money away from companies that need it to grow. My Accountable Capitalism Act would end big companies catering to the short-term interests of Wall Street and let our companies focus on long-term growth and their obligations to workers.
Too many families face a choice of paying a late fee on their bills, an overdraft fee to the bank, or a sky-high interest rate to a payday lender while waiting on checks. The government should adopt real-time payment technology so families don't have to wait for checks to clear.
I‚Äôve spent years advocating for postal banking‚Äîallowing the United States Postal Service to partner with local community banks and credit unions to provide access to low-cost, basic banking services. As President, I‚Äôll make it happen by appointing people committed to the cause.
It's also time to push our financial system back to its core purpose‚Äîgiving people a place to put their money ; connecting savers with borrowers. Our system doesn‚Äôt serve a huge slice of the country: 25% of American households don‚Äôt have adequate access to a simple bank account.
And we need to end the system where bankers can make huge bonuses if risky bets pay off but lose nothing if they fail. I'll appoint regulators who will impose tough new rules to rein in banker pay.
First, we should enact my 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, which rebuilds the wall between commercial and investment banks and ends taxpayer subsidies for excessive risk-taking and speculation.
Next, my plan would address the incentives that fuel useless speculation that can make bankers rich but undermines the rest of the economy. Washington has encouraged this speculation with giveaways, subsidies, and lax rules. I want to end these practices immediately.
My plan starts by ending this looting and fundamentally changing the industry. Private equity firms will only make money if the company succeeds. And if they make bad investments, they'll be held accountable instead of walking away with millions.
Just look at the private equity industry. They buy companies and bleed them dry. And when the company fails, the Wall Street guys walk away with millions while workers are left holding the bag. It's legalized looting.
Study after study shows that, past a certain point, a growing financial sector hurts the rest of the economy by extracting money from it. And America is way past that point.
For decades, Washington has lived by a simple rule: If it‚Äôs good for Wall Street, it‚Äôs good for the economy. But it just isn‚Äôt true. Big banks are making record profits and handing out huge bonuses as average wages barely budge.
Wall Street is looting the economy‚Äîand Washington is helping them do it. I‚Äôm tired of big financial firms padding their own pockets while the rest of the economy suffers, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve got a plan to end it: 
We must call out those who remain silent. We must initiate impeachment proceedings to hold him accountable. And we must build an unstoppable grassroots movement that resoundingly defeats not just Trump, but complicit Republicans everywhere.
This president is desperate. Calling out his racism, xenophobia, and misogyny is imperative. But he‚Äôs trying to divide us and distract from his own crimes, and from his deeply unpopular agenda of letting the wealthy and well-connected rip off the country. We must do more.

Our fight for a federal minimum wage will not come at the cost of employment for Americans with disabilities. Creating a false choice between the two is cruel and ableist. Americans with disabilities are Americans deserving of equal pay and opportunity.

Voting should be safe and easy for everyone, including Americans with disabilities. Throughout National Disability Voter Registration Week, we must recommit to ensuring that everyone‚Äôs voice is heard in our democracy. 
Last month, I went to a migrant detention center in Florida. I saw children being treated like prisoners. We must clean up the mess at the border, reverse Donald Trump‚Äôs vile policies, and build a fair immigration system. Here‚Äôs my plan to make it happen:  
Last weekend at I was very clear: When I‚Äôm president of the United States, we will end the criminal abuse of immigrants and hold the Trump administration responsible for its cruelty. 
My own family plunged deep into debt when my daddy had a heart attack. Health care is a basic human right ‚Äî and it‚Äôs time to fight for it. I‚Äôm proud to support Medicare for All in the Senate. Add your name if you agree that it‚Äôs time to fight for Medicare for All.
I stand with Puerto Ricans who are taking to the streets this week to protest government corruption ; Governor deeply offensive comments. His actions are hurtful ; undermine the public trust. He must answer to the Puerto Rican people. 
Toxic chemicals are contaminating communities in New Hampshire and throughout our country‚Äîand Donald Trump's corrupt EPA isn‚Äôt moving fast enough to help. Enough. We need real action now to clean up contamination and keep our communities safe. 
Why not both of us? I‚Äôll be looking for your campaign in 2040! 
The American people shouldn‚Äôt have to wonder if our Department of Defense is working for them or for giant defense contractors. Mark Esper won‚Äôt fully address his conflicts of interest, and it‚Äôs a big red flag. 
Every time I meet a grassroots supporter, I feel grateful down to my bones. Person by person and plan by plan, we‚Äôre building a movement to make our country work for working people. Will you join this fight and chip in $3 today? 
I read all 448 pages of the Mueller report the day it came out three months ago. When I finished it, I called for impeachment. No one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States. 
Race matters‚Äîand we need to call it out. Black Americans are more likely to be arrested, wrongfully convicted, and serve longer sentences than white Americans. We must end mass incarceration and fix our broken criminal justice system.

 Be prepared and   
It‚Äôs not equal justice when a kid with an ounce of pot can get thrown in jail, while a big bank executive who cheats and defrauds Americans can get a bonus. The words above the Supreme Court say "Equal Justice Under Law"‚Äîwe need to start acting like it.
This is an injustice. We have a responsibility to protect our citizens‚Äîand to hold police accountable when they fail. No one is safe in a country with a broken criminal justice system. My heart goes out to Eric Garner's family today. 
Good. 
 What a guy!
This is another targeted, xenophobic attack from the Trump administration. As president, I‚Äôll reinstate TPS designations and Deferred Enforced Departure to protect those at risk back in their home countries, including migrants from Central America.

Giant corporations like Amazon have too much power‚Äîin fact, nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. My administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition‚Äîincluding breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.

Will you sign my petition to make it clear that we won‚Äôt shy away from holding the Trump administration accountable for their abuses? We‚Äôre going to fight these human rights violations with everything we‚Äôve got. And we won‚Äôt ever back down. 
When people come to our borders desperate‚Äîpeople whose lives have been turned upside down, people trying to build a better future‚Äîwe need to treat them with humanity, and we need to follow the law.
Trump may look the other way‚Äîbut President Elizabeth Warren will not. I'll launch a task force in the Department of Justice to investigate the Trump administration‚Äôs criminal abuses at the border, and we‚Äôll hold perpetrators accountable. Here‚Äôs the plan: 
I‚Äôve got a message for the Trump administration: When you physically abuse immigrants, sexually abuse immigrants, or refuse to supply immigrants with the medical care that they need, you break the law of the United States of America.
Woo-hoo!  we persist Honored to be fighting alongside you all.

Let‚Äôs be clear about what this vile comment is: A racist and xenophobic attack on Democratic congresswomen. This *is* their country, regardless of whether or not Trump realizes it. They should be treated with respect. As president, I‚Äôll make sure of it.

It made me think about my family, too, how my mother would work her grocery list to squeeze out every last nickel. In that moment, I knew Bruce and I would be bound to each other forever. And when I proposed to him, he said yes. Happy anniversary, Bruce! I love you. 
One day at the grocery store soon after we first met, I saw Bruce gazing at the strawberry display. I said, ‚ÄúWe can get some if you want!‚Äù He smiled, picked up a carton, and told me he was thinking about his family. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt eat things like fresh strawberries,‚Äù he explained.

But under watch, fewer than 1% of borrowers who applied to the program have had their loans forgiven.I stand with in fighting back and making things right for these borrowers. 
When thousands of public servants were at risk of being denied federal student loan relief, I pushed back. I helped expand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program by $700M to help teachers, firefighters, and other Americans get the relief they earned.

We need big, structural change in our immigration system. Today, I announced my plan for fair, humane immigration reform that reflects our values. Read the plan and join our fight:  
This ruling on  is part of a targeted attack on women with low incomes and women of color by right-wing ideologues. We must pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive health care. I have a plan for that:  
Necesitamos un cambio estructural: un sistema de inmigraci√≥n justo que preserve nuestra seguridad, ayude a crecer nuestra econom√≠a y refleje nuestros valores.
Trabajar√© con el Congreso para aprobar una reforma de inmigraci√≥n de gran alcance, pero tambi√©n estoy lista para ejercer el poder ejecutivo si se niegan a actuar.
No podemos enfrentar la migraci√≥n hasta que no enfrentemos sus causas‚Äîpobreza, cambio clim√°tico, violencia e injusticia. Como presidenta, restaurar√© e incrementar√© esfuerzos para enfrentar el crimen transnacional. Y mi administraci√≥n proteger√° a las personas que busquen asilo.
Trabajar√© para expandir la inmigraci√≥n legal e implementar√© acciones ejecutivas para proteger a los Dreamers y aquellos que han formado sus vidas en nuestro pa√≠s, mientras trabajamos para crear una soluci√≥n legislativa que asegure una ruta justa y asequible a la naturalizaci√≥n.
Nuestras leyes y valores nos impulsan a ayudar a los que huyen de la violencia y la opresi√≥n. Como presidenta, rechazar√© las pol√≠ticas de exclusi√≥n basadas en raza, religi√≥n o nacionalidad. En mi primer d√≠a, revertir√© la pol√≠tica racista de la prohibici√≥n de los musulmanes.
Eliminaremos la expulsi√≥n r√°pida y proveeremos el debido proceso bajo la ley para inmigrantes enfrentando deportaci√≥n, garantizando que tengan vistas en la corte y d√°ndoles acceso a consultor√≠a legal.
Acabar√© con la detenci√≥n innecesaria, enfocando estos esfuerzos en personas que presenten un riesgo de fuga o riesgos a la seguridad de otros. Y, para prevenir abusos futuros en nuestro sistema de inmigraci√≥n, mi administraci√≥n establecer√° cortes independientes de inmigraci√≥n.
Reducir√© la detenci√≥n de manera dr√°stica. Separar a las familias y detener a los vulnerables es costoso, inhumano, y se ha comprobado que no tiene un efecto disuasivo.
Mi administraci√≥n exigir√° la rendici√≥n de cuentas por los abusos cometidos bajo la administraci√≥n de Trump. Designar√© un grupo de trabajo en el DOJ para investigar acusaciones graves y les dar√© autoridad independiente para que puedan presentar denuncias penales.
Las agencias de inmigraci√≥n deber√≠an proteger a los estadounidenses y defender nuestras leyes, en vez de dedicarse a perseguir pol√≠ticas punitivas y anti inmigratorias que afectan‚Äîmayormente‚Äîa las comunidades de color. Como presidenta, reconstruir√© el CBP y ICE de pies a cabeza.
Entrar al pa√≠s sin autorizaci√≥n siempre ha sido una violaci√≥n civil bajo la ley de inmigraci√≥n, pero gracias a un ex senador segregacionista, tambi√©n es una violaci√≥n criminal. Esto es innecesario para la seguridad fronteriza y deber√≠amos eliminar esta prohibici√≥n criminal.
Mi plan comienza por eliminar el cumplimiento de la ley de manera abusiva. Trump ha usado la deportaci√≥n como un arma costosa, ineficaz y dise√±ada para maximizar el dolor. Como presidenta de los Estados Unidos, acabar√© con esta crueldad.
Los inmigrantes son nuestros vecinos, colegas y amigos. Son tan parte de EE.UU. como aquellas personas que han nacido en este pa√≠s. Nuestro sistema de inmigraci√≥n deber√≠a ser justo, humano y deber√≠a reflejar nuestros valores. Nuestros vecinos no deber√≠an vivir con miedo.
Trump ha llevado nuestro sistema de inmigraci√≥n al extremo m√°s punitivo. Sus pol√≠ticas racistas se basan en un sistema roto y una infraestructura del cumplimiento de la ley que es abusiva. Hoy anuncio mi plan para reformar nuestro sistema de inmigraci√≥n. 
I‚Äôll work with Congress to pass broad-reaching reform, but I‚Äôm also prepared to move forward with executive action if they refuse to act. We need big, structural change: A fair immigration system that preserves our security, grows our economy, and reflects our values.
But we cannot fully address migration until we address its root causes‚Äîpoverty, climate change, violence and injustice. As president, I‚Äôll restore and increase aid and step up efforts to address transnational crime. And my administration will protect those seeking refuge here.
I‚Äôll also work to expand legal immigration and take executive action to provide a measure of protection for our Dreamers and those who have built careers and families here, while pursuing a legislative solution that provides a fair and achievable path to citizenship.
Our laws and our values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. As president, I‚Äôll reject exclusionary policies based on race, religion and nationality, and I‚Äôll reverse Trump‚Äôs bigoted Muslim Ban on my first day in office.
To prevent future abuses of our immigration system, my administration will establish independent immigration courts. We'll eliminate expedited removal and provide due process for immigrants facing deportation, guaranteeing hearings and providing access to counsel.
Next, I‚Äôll significantly reduce immigration detention. Separating families and detaining the vulnerable is expensive, inhumane, and has no proven deterrent effect. I‚Äôll end unnecessary detention, detaining only those who pose a safety risk, and stop for-profit detention entirely.
And my administration will demand accountability for the abuse committed under the Trump administration. I'll set up a DOJ task force to investigate accusations of serious violations and give it independent authority to pursue any criminal allegations.
Our immigration agencies should protect Americans and uphold the rule of law, not pursue punitive anti-immigrant policies that target communities of color. As president, I'll reshape CBP and ICE from top to bottom.
Entering the country without authorization has always been a violation of civil immigration law, but thanks to a former segregationist senator, it‚Äôs also a criminal violation. This is totally unnecessary for border security, and we should repeal the criminal prohibition.
My plan starts with eliminating abusive enforcement. Trump has weaponized deportation in ways that are costly, ineffective, and designed to maximize pain. As president, I will end this cruelty.
Immigrants are our neighbors, our colleagues, and our friends‚Äîand every bit as much a part of America as those who were born in the United States. Our immigration system must be fair, humane, and reflect our values. Our neighbors shouldn‚Äôt have to live in fear.
President Trump has taken our immigration system to its most punitive extreme, but his racist policies build on a broken system and an enforcement infrastructure already primed for abuse. Today, I'm announcing my plan to reform our immigration system. 
As president, I will immediately reinstate the DACA program and expand protections for our Dreamers and their families, to provide a measure of protection while pursuing a path to citizenship. Sign up now if you‚Äôre with me in this fight.

We need to take bold action to attack climate change. I'm proud to support the  I've also got plans to invest in clean energy tech and to stop drilling and promote renewables on public lands. This plan is another tool we can use to attack climate change.
My Climate Risk Disclosure plan requires companies to publicly disclose both environmental ; financial climate-related risks to their business. Investors are already divesting from fossil fuel companies, and this will push more investors to divest and transition to clean energy.
Publicly traded companies have an obligation to share important information about their business. But right now they don't share much about how climate change might affect them, their customers, and their investors.
I've got a new plan to accelerate the transition to clean energy and combat climate change. I'm proud it has the support of former Vice President and and original authors of the Green New Deal. 
My mother‚Äôs minimum wage job at Sears saved our family after my daddy‚Äôs heart attack. In today‚Äôs America, it won‚Äôt keep a mama and baby out of poverty. We must raise the minimum wage to $15. Working families deserve living wages.

The experiences of women of color are not one-dimensional: Sexual orientation, gender identity, and ability all shape how a person‚Äôs work is valued in the workplace. Women of color work hard for their families. Our economy should work hard for them.

Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education in our history. We need someone who will actually fight for students, not for giant corporations. So when suggested that the next Secretary of Education should be a former public school teacher, I pledged to make it happen. 
The gap between white and Black homeownership rates today is about 30% ‚Äî bigger than it was in 1960 when housing discrimination was legal. This enormous gap is a moral stain on our country, and my housing plan tackles it head on. 
The black homeownership rate today is nearly the same as it was when housing discrimination was legal. We need to fight for Black families and tackle this housing crisis head on ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what my housing plan for America does.

This is just the first step‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a necessary one. It‚Äôs time to build an America that recognizes the role that women of color play in their families and in the economy, that fairly values their work, and that delivers equal opportunity for everyone.
Finally, I will strengthen enforcement against systemic discrimination. I will direct federal agencies to target enforcement towards industries where we know women of color face higher rates of discrimination.
I will also make sure the senior ranks of the federal government look like America. My administration will ensure that federal agencies recruit women of color and develop leadership paths for them. The government should do better if it demands more from the private sector.
First, I will have new requirements for federal contractors: companies with bad track records on equal pay and management diversity won‚Äôt get new contracts. No contractor will be permitted to use forced arbitration and non-compete clauses for low- and medium-wage workers.
The government has helped perpetuate the systemic discrimination that has denied women of color equal opportunities, and it‚Äôs time to right those wrongs. I've got a plan to boost their wages, open up career advancement, and fight systemic discrimination.
The gender pay gap hits women of color particularly hard. When future employers use salary history to make new offers, they trap women of color in lower wages. Black and Brown women are disproportionately mistreated at work. Their path to higher-level management jobs is rockier.
Women of color face a steeper climb to provide financial security for their families because of systemic discrimination. On Day One of a Warren administration, I‚Äôll take a series of executive actions to help boost their wages and leadership opportunities. 
On  I‚Äôm celebrating our democracy‚Äîand recommitting to protect it. Our elections should be as secure as Fort Knox. Instead, they‚Äôre less secure than an Amazon account. I have a plan to make voting easy and secure for everyone. 
Thank you, Nevada! Your energy inspires me. 
It was great to see and meet the wonderful people at Mari Chuy‚Äôs Mexican Kitchen yesterday. Thanks for having me! 
Today we celebrate our country and recommit to the big, structural changes we need to make our government and our economy work for everyone‚Äînot just for those at the top. I‚Äôll fight my heart out for that. Happy

I had a lovely time at our AAPI community conversation in Las Vegas today. Thank you for taking the time to chat with me! 
Thank you for the warm welcome, Nevada! 
I‚Äôm glad to see people in Massachusetts and across the country fighting for our immigrant communities today. I stand with you in solidarity all the way. 
Sickening. Human beings are being herded like animals right now in our country. This goes against our American values. It‚Äôs cruel and it must end‚Äînow. 
There‚Äôs still time to RSVP to our community conversation tonight in Nevada. I hope I‚Äôll see you there! 
This kind of xenophobic fear-mongering is sick. In a Warren administration, immigrant communities will be able to live without fear or discrimination. I will fight for them every step of the way. 
When I‚Äôm president, I‚Äôll make certain that every person‚Äîregardless of race, creed, or economic background‚Äîis paid a living wage so they can build a secure future for themselves and their families. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôll make our economy work for working people.

Rising housing costs have Americans in a vice grip, and Nevadans are among the hardest-hit. One of the root causes of the problem? A severe lack of affordable housing supply, and state and local land-use rules that needlessly drive up housing costs. 
These racist and sexist comments are completely unacceptable. We need answers‚Äîand the agents involved must be held accountable.

I don‚Äôt spend my time at fancy closed-door fundraisers trading favors for money, and I‚Äôll appoint only the most qualified person for the job. In a Warren administration, I pledge not to give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers. Period.
Trump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons. He's appointed political cronies to nearly half the available ambassadorial positions. He may think a fat wallet and a big campaign check qualifies someone to represent our country abroad. I don't.
To do this, we need to recruit a new generation of foreign service officers and retain talented officers. I‚Äôll also significantly expand the pool of diplomatic talent. Today‚Äôs foreign service is 79% white and 65% male. Our foreign service must reflect the diversity of the U.S.
Our foreign policy should not be run out of the Pentagon. Under a Warren administration, it won‚Äôt be. So I‚Äôll start by doubling the size of the foreign service and opening new diplomatic posts in underserved areas to broaden U.S. diplomatic presence.
The Pentagon is nearly 40 times bigger than the State Department‚Äîwe employ more people in military grocery stores than we do foreign service officers. Our underinvestment in diplomacy causes our leaders to default to military action, instead of treating it as a last resort.
Senior career officials at the State Department have been pushed out ; others have resigned in protest. We've lost 60% of our career ambassadors ; 20% of our most experienced civil servants. Too often they've been replaced with totally unqualified campaign donors ; Trump cronies.
To take a meaningful leadership position in the world, protect our interests, and avoid conflicts, we need world-class diplomats. But through a toxic combination of malice and neglect, Donald Trump has declared war on the State Department.
The practice of auctioning off American diplomacy to the highest bidder must end. I'm pledging to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors‚Äîand I call on everyone running for President to do the same. Read my full plan:

I know is working hard to win in 2020. Something else we need to work hard on: Protecting our democracy. At our Miami town hall, I made a commitment to protect our elections. 
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs covered under my new plan to protect U.S. elections: üó≥Ô∏è No more voter registration problemsüó≥Ô∏è No more voter purgesüó≥Ô∏è No more gerrymandering üó≥Ô∏è Election Day will be a federal holiday
The harsh truth is that our elections are vulnerable to attack. Some voter registration databases are still using Windows 2000. My latest plan would make U.S. elections as secure as Fort Knox. 
Yesterday, I met activists who‚Äôve been standing outside Homestead for months. I met grandmas and moms, dads and uncles. I met little children and a woman who said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here every day.‚Äù Together, we‚Äôre fighting for immigration policies that reflect our values. 
The Census must count every person. Our Constitution demands it. Our democracy requires it. And I hope that the courts will continue to keep this racist and blatantly partisan question off of the 2020 Census.
 ¬°H√°gase Contar! Census 2020 Campaign is already working to ensure that immigrant and Latinx communities are fully counted, and I join them in calling on these communities to be heard.
Finally, we'd ban the use of citizenship questions in government surveys and implement lasting reforms to the Census to prevent any president from using these kinds of tricks to take political representation or other resources away from immigrant communities.
Next, my administration would conduct a second Census‚Äîwithout any questions about citizenship‚Äîto replace Trump's tainted Census in advance of the 2022 midterm elections. And I would have an aggressive, well-funded outreach campaign to reach historically undercounted communities.
Here's how this would work. First, I would immediately direct all executive agencies to ignore the tainted Census data until a new Census is complete. States receive nearly $600 billion per year from 16 programs tied to Census data, ; we won't allow a tainted Census to skew that.
If the Trump admin somehow manages to get that question back on the Census, I will cancel that rigged Census and replace it with a fair and accurate one. And I'll make this promise right now: A Warren administration would never include a citizenship question on the Census.
The Supreme Court's ruling blocking the citizenship question on the 2020 Census is a welcome relief‚Äîbut the Court has left open the possibility that the Trump administration could still add a citizenship question to the Census. And if they do, I have a plan for that.
I'm done playing by a different set of rules. As president, I'll push to require states to use independent redistricting commissions to draw fair districts. And if Republicans keep standing in the way of fair elections, I'll push to end the filibuster. 
Mitch McConnell says efforts to stop gerrymandering are "socialist". Chief Justice Roberts pays lip service to the idea that gerrymandering is bad‚Äîbut then hands the keys to our democracy over to a bunch of cheats. Republicans are trying to rig the game, and they're winning.
The Supreme Court's decision is an abomination. Five Republican-appointed justices gave the green light to partisan gerrymandering‚Äîwhich lets Republicans pursue their extreme agenda without accountability to the people. It's bad for our democracy and we need to fight back.
Under my plan, federal elections will get state-of-the-art federal machines, federal ballots, and federal security. The federal government will replace insecure and outdated systems with hand-marked, voter-verified paper ballot machines. Sign up now to fight for our democracy.
Under my plan, we will have federal standards to ensure everyone can vote, including automatic and same-day registration, early voting, and vote by mail. We will also make Election Day a holiday to make it easier for people to get to the polls. Sign up now if you're with me.
Under my plan, there will be no more gerrymandering: states will be required to use independent redistricting commissions to draw federal congressional districts. If you're with me, sign up now.

When women fight, women win. Congratulations, 
Homestead is hot and barren, with a completely enclosed fence. I saw children being marched from one building to another in single file lines. No laughing, no playing. These are children who are prisoners. 
At Homestead, a young girl named Lea gave me a hand-written note. She wrote about the fear of losing her parents to deportation and asked me to fight for immigration reform.No child should have to grow up with that fear. Lea, I promise: We‚Äôre in this fight together. 
I went to the Homestead, FL detention center this morning to shine a light on what‚Äôs happening. There‚Äôs no place in this country for operating private prisons that profit off of cruelty. Detention centers like the one in Homestead should be shut down. 
These are children‚Äîchildren. Mark Morgan‚Äôs racist comments disqualify him from leading 
 needs to answer for its misuse of solitary confinement. Immigrants in custody who are disabled or are sexual assault survivors may be especially in need of protection. Locking them up for at least 22 hours a day is cruel and unnecessary.

‚ÄúThey had been detained for weeks without access to soap, clean clothes or adequate food.‚ÄùThis is inhumane. In a Warren administration, we will treat immigrant children with the dignity and respect they deserve. 
There are a lot of different ways that we get in the fight. And one of them is that you show up. I'm at the Homestead detention center today and I hope you'll be watching. 
A year ago today, SCOTUS made the wrong decision in upholding Donald Trump‚Äôs bigoted and xenophobic Muslim ban. We won‚Äôt forget and we won‚Äôt stop fighting until Muslims are treated with dignity and respect.
Yesterday at my town hall in Miami, I got asked an important question: Would I go to the Homestead detention center to shine a light on what's happening? The answer is yes. I'll be there today and I hope you'll join me.

The Mueller report made clear that the president obstructed justice multiple times. If he were anyone else, he'd be in handcuffs. Attorney General Barr can try to cover for the president all he wants, but the American people deserve to hear the full truth from Mueller himself.
At tonight's town hall in Miami, an audience member asked me to go to the Homestead detention center‚Äîwhere the Trump administration is holding immigrant children separated from their families‚Äîand shine a light on what's happening. I'll be there tomorrow‚Äîand I hope you'll join me. 
One way I‚Äôm fighting is through my plan to end for-profit detention centers, which have made millions implementing Trump‚Äôs cruel immigration policies. Today 73% of detained immigrants are held in private detention facilities. Under my plan, we‚Äôll end this. 
I saw the same thing at a processing center in McAllen, TX. I'll never forget listening to traumatized moms and children begging to be reunited. Let me make this clear: I'll never stop fighting Trump's cruel immigration policies. 
This week marks a year since I visited the Port Isabel Reunification Center in Los Fresnos, TX to find out what was really happening to immigrant families ripped apart at our border. I saw right away: It wasn‚Äôt a unification center‚Äîit was a prison. 
I agree with We shouldn't criminalize families trying to build a better future. We need comprehensive immigration reform that's in line with our values and creates a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including our DREAMers.

It‚Äôs time to make voting easy and convenient, stop racist voter suppression, and secure our elections. I've got a plan to protect our democracy. 
Our democracy is too important for our elections to be under-resourced, undermined, and vulnerable. We need to do everything we can to make sure our elections are convenient, professional, and secure. Read my full plan here: 
Finally, we'll provide incentives and resources for states to improve state elections‚Äîand where racist or corrupt politicians refuse to follow the law, the federal government will temporarily take over the administration of their federal elections to guarantee the right to vote.
Next, we'll establish federal standards to ensure everyone can vote, including mandating automatic and same-day registration, early voting, and vote by mail. No more arbitrary voter purges, registration issues, or gerrymandering. We'll make Election Day a national holiday.
I'll start by making sure federal elections get state-of-the-art machines, ballots, and security. We'll replace every voting machine in the country with state-of-the-art equipment and require adoption of a uniform federal ballot. And we'll make sure those systems are secure.
We need a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote. But we can also take action now. The federal government has the power to regulate federal elections, secure our democracy, and put a stop to racist voter suppression.
Our elections are less secure than your Amazon account. They're under-resourced and undermined by partisan and racist officials who try to stop people from exercising their right to vote. We need to protect our democracy‚Äîand I‚Äôve got a plan for that: 
We have a plan for  a bill to make it happen. I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre in this fight together, 
Our laws should reflect our values. A two-cent tax on the wealthiest 75,000 fortunes will help rebuild the middle class and give every family a shot at the American dream.

It's not enough to say that we don't want conflict‚Äîwe must make one less likely. Congress must make clear that war with Iran is not authorized. We should work with our allies to deescalate tensions and create space for diplomacy. We can't afford another forever war.

Washington hands billions to corporations profiting off of inhumane detention and incarceration policies while ignoring the families that are destroyed. It's corruption, plain and simple. Incarcerating and detaining millions for profit doesn‚Äôt keep us safe. We must do better.
Finally, I'll hold contractors accountable by expanding oversight, transparency and enforcement. It‚Äôs time to shine sunlight on the black box of private services that receive taxpayer dollars.
Next, I'll prohibit contractors from charging service fees for essential services, like phone calls, bank transfers, and health care. Companies shouldn‚Äôt be able to treat incarcerated individuals as captive profit centers.
First, I'll end all contracts between the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service and private detention providers. There should be no place in America for profiting off of putting more people behind bars or in detention.
The government has a basic responsibility to keep the people in its care safe‚Äînot to use their punishment and detention as an opportunity for profit. As president, I'll ban all private prisons and detention facilities: 
Our criminal and immigration systems are tearing apart communities of color and devastating the poor, including children. Women‚Äîespecially women of color‚Äîare particularly saddled with the financial burden.
And the exploitation doesn‚Äôt end when people leave these facilities. For-profit supervision companies (which are often run by the same private prison corporations) get rich by charging outrageous fees for monitoring and supervision services like ankle monitors.
The companies running prisons and detention centers regularly sacrifice safety to boost their bottom line. Private contractors in both public and private centers regularly cut corners to maximize margins and come up with schemes to make millions off of incarcerated people.
The private prison population has grown rapidly since 2000. And with Donald Trump in the White House, private prison companies saw an opportunity to make millions off of his cruel immigration policies. Today, 73% of detained immigrants are held in private detention facilities.
Private prison companies have spent millions to turn our criminal and immigration policies into ones that prioritize making them rich instead of keeping us safe‚Äîwith terrible consequences. Today I‚Äôm announcing my plan to end this private profiteering off of cruelty.
Donald Trump promised to bring our troops home. Instead he has pulled out of a deal that was working and instigated another unnecessary conflict. There is no justification for further escalating this crisis‚Äîwe need to step back from the brink of war. 
Here's my big idea: I want to cancel student loan debt and provide universal free college. And we can pay for it all with my Ultra-Millionaire Tax.

The Small Business Equity Fund will create jobs, spur economic growth, and move us closer to an America where everyone has a fair shot to succeed. And the entire cost of this plan will be paid for by my Ultra-Millionaire Tax. Read my full plan here: 
This tilts the field against entrepreneurs of color. So I plan to address this disparity head on too. I will require states and cities administering my new Fund to work with diverse investment managers‚Äîputting $7 billion in the hands of minority-and women-owned managers.
But even if we fully close the startup capital gap, deep systemic issues will continue to tilt the playing field. 86% of venture capitalists are white, and studies show that investors are more likely to partner with entrepreneurs who look like them.
$7 billion ensures that if Black, Latinx, ; Native American entrepreneurs start businesses at the same rate as white entrepreneurs, we could fully close the startup capital gap for the next ten years‚Äîsupporting over 100,000 new businesses and 1.1 million new jobs.
As president, I will launch a $7 billion Small Business Equity Fund to provide grants to entrepreneurs‚Äînot loans or loan guarantees. Loans aren‚Äôt as good as equity because they leave businesses with debt when they‚Äôre trying to grow. Equity helps businesses thrive from the start.
That disparity in startup capital is creating a small business gap that costs us millions of jobs ; billions in economic growth. And it's another example of how the racial wealth gap in America hurts Black, Latinx, Native American, and other minority families ; communities.
On average, Black, Latinx, Native American, and other minority households have significantly less wealth than white households. So they have less to put into their small businesses, and less collateral to get outside credit.
The racial wealth gap tilts the playing field against entrepreneurs of color, holding back our economy. The government helped create that wealth gap, and the government has an obligation to address it. I have a new plan to tackle it head on.
Thank you, I‚Äôm honored to have your support. 
Mueller‚Äôs statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He‚Äôs referring Trump for impeachment. Yesterday, Trump said‚Äîonce again‚Äîthat he‚Äôd take information from a foreign government. It‚Äôs up to Congress to act. 
A hostile foreign government interfered in the 2016 election, and Trump welcomed their help. Now Trump says he‚Äôll welcome that help again. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: We have a constitutional responsibility to begin impeachment proceedings. 
This bill is an important first step. But we can't let future generations be trapped by another student debt crisis. That's why I've also got a plan to provide universal free public college for all. Read all about it here: 
You can use my student debt calculator to find out how much you could save if we pass the Warren-Clyburn proposal: 
We'll free up an entire generation so that they can buy homes, launch businesses, and start their families. And our bill will also provide an enormous middle-class stimulus and reduce the racial wealth gap.
Our bill will cancel student loan debt for more than 95% of Americans who carry it, and wipe out student loan debt entirely for more than 75% of Americans with that debt.
Student loan debt is crushing an entire generation. That‚Äôs why Rep. James Clyburn‚Äîwho has always been a leader on economic justice issues‚Äîand I are introducing a truly transformational bill to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans.

Trump‚Äôs companies continue to take money from foreign governments with business before his White House. This reeks of corruption. My  bill would make these conflicts of interest illegal. 
This is just another petty, cruel way for the Trump administration to signal they won't support or defend LGBTQ+ communities at home or abroad. We should fly the Pride flag proudly‚Äîand take real, meaningful actions to bolster ; protect LGBTQ+ civil rights.

The legacy of our federal government‚Äôs racist redlining policies still hurts Black and Brown families. The gap between white homeownership and Black homeownership rates today is about 30%‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbigger than it was in 1960 when housing discrimination was legal.

Today I'm thinking about the people marching in the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. We need leadership that puts the interests of all U.S. citizens‚Äîincluding our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico‚Äîahead of Wall Street‚Äôs profit margins. 
Last week when I was in Michigan, I rolled out a new plan to fight climate change and create over a million new jobs. Read more about my Green Manufacturing Plan here. 
I didn‚Äôt march in last year‚Äôs Parade‚ÄîI danced! The whole march is a celebration of unity and love, and a chance to recommit to fighting like hell for LGBTQ+ equality. Happy Pride, Boston!   
I‚Äôm proud that Massachusetts was the first state to make marriage equality the law of the land‚Äîand I‚Äôm deeply grateful every time I get to march in the parade. Though I‚Äôm not there in person this year, I‚Äôm fighting alongside you today and every day!  
I got an important question in Lansing earlier this week. On  and every day, I‚Äôm fighting my heart out to end the gun violence epidemic in this country and fight the influence on our government. 
Here‚Äôs what my Green Manufacturing Plan would do:‚úÖMake a real investment in science‚úÖCommit $1.5 trillion to our federal government to buy American and buy green‚úÖDevelop and manufacture American products here to sell all around the world 
The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy and build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for IA and for all Americans.

Payday lenders spent buckets of money on Trump's campaign and properties. Then Trump's director, Kathy Kraninger, did the predatory payday lending industry a huge favor by rolling back important regulations. It's corruption, plain and simple. 
When I was in Michigan this week, I met a lot of young people who were fired up and ready to fight for big, structural change. I‚Äôm glad to see Michigan make it easier for college students to vote! 
Trump's former chief of staff played a huge role in the inhumane family separation policy. Now John Kelly's joining the board of a company that runs Homestead, the largest detention center for migrant kids. Rep. and I are demanding answers.

We had a great organizing event in Detroit earlier this week, and one of the best parts was receiving more notes from people in the selfie line! I love reading about what gets people into this fight for big, structural change. 
Ninety-five town halls completed, 28,000 pictures taken, 425 audience questions answered‚Äîand we‚Äôre just getting started. Thank you to everyone who tuned in or showed up to our  last night! 
The Hyde Amendment limits women's access to safe, legal abortion‚Äîparticularly women of color.  It‚Äôs time for Hyde to go. 
I'm in the fight for reproductive rights all the way. We need to:‚úÖEnd the  and Trump‚Äôs gag rule‚úÖPass the EACH Woman Act ‚úÖEnsure that  includes contraception and abortion coverage‚úÖDefend  family planning funding
Thank you to the community of Elkhart for an inspiring organizing event yesterday. I‚Äôm grateful down to my toes to have you in this fight, and I‚Äôll never stop fighting for new, good jobs in Indiana and across the country. 
Here‚Äôs what really troubles me: The Trump administration keeps trying to deny science across the board. At our  I made it clear: Climate change is one of the biggest crises we face, and we need to make big, structural changes in order to address it head on. 
To me, this is what leadership is about: You start with what you believe is right, and you get out there and fight for it. 
On today's  we remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought to liberate Europe and secure the world's freedom. We honor them by fighting to make the world a better and more just place, today and every day.
My campaign has submitted their support to join 2320. Every worker who wants to join a union, bargain collectively, ; make their voice heard should have a chance to do so. The labor movement has long fought for the dignity of working people, ; we‚Äôre proud to be part of it.
Of course I stayed for selfies after our  I‚Äôm deeply grateful for everyone who tuned in. 
Gov. Inslee is exactly right. Climate change is the biggest challenge we face. Every candidate running for president should have a serious set of policies to address it, and should be eager to defend those proposals in a debate.

When I was growing up, before Roe v. Wade, people still got abortions. Some were lucky. Others weren‚Äôt. They all went through hell. The overwhelming majority of Americans have no desire to return to the world before Roe. Add your name if you‚Äôre ready to fight back.
Congress should create federal, statutory rights that parallel Roe‚Äôs protections. We must ensure that choice remains the law ‚Äî even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Add your name if you‚Äôre with me, and let‚Äôs fight to get this done.
Congress should pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care from right-wing ideologues in the states: federal laws that ensure real access to birth control and abortion care for all women. Add your name if you‚Äôre with me, and let‚Äôs fight to get this done.
We‚Äôre in Fort Wayne tonight because the people of Indiana know we need an economy that works not just for the people at the top, but for everyone. We need our economy and government to work for the people‚Äîand that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre fighting to do.

This is a big win for Nevada, and I‚Äôm glad to see state employees organize and make their voices heard. Unions built the middle class and unions will rebuild the middle class. 
Right now, Washington is broken. But I still believe in Bobby Kennedy‚Äôs ripple of hope. I believe that history is shaped from numberless diverse acts of courage. And you bet I‚Äôll keep fighting for a better America.
But that promise isn‚Äôt gone. It‚Äôs not gone in the eyes of the people I meet who remember Bobby‚Äôs presidential campaign in 1968. And it‚Äôs not gone in the millions of people who still believe that we can build a better future for our children and grandchildren.
I remember how, when Bobby Kennedy was assassinated 51 years ago today, the promise of a better America seemed to vanish. Our country continued down a dangerous road where the rich got richer, and everyone else got left behind.
Grateful down to my toes for the fired-up, grassroots supporters at our organizing event in Detroit today. Together we can level the playing field for working families in Michigan and across the country. 
I‚Äôm glad to see House Democrats pass a Dream Act with 237 votes today. Now the Senate needs to do its job and pass the  act.

Today, I took pledge to support fair districts and end partisan gerrymandering. I‚Äôm with all the way. The power belongs to the people, and voters should choose their representatives‚Äînot the other way around. 
Some big, ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù companies will ship jobs overseas and hollow out our cities if it'll save them a nickel. And many already have. I've got a plan to make sure a Warren administration will defend and create good American jobs. 
My green manufacturing plan rewards American companies who invest at home. It's funded by my Real Corporate Profits Tax on giant companies who try to dodge their fair share in taxes. It'll create 1M new jobs ; make the U.S. the leader in the global fight against climate change.
Third, a Green Marshall Plan. The government will use all its tools to boost American industry and cut global emissions abroad. We will deploy U.S.-manufactured clean energy technology to every corner of the world, and I'll commit at least $100 billion to do it.
Second: a Green Industrial Mobilization. I'll commit $1.5 trillion to buy clean, renewable, and emission-free energy products, supporting only American companies who manufacture here at home and treat workers with respect, to boost demand and galvanize our clean energy industry.
My green manufacturing plan has three parts. First: A Green Apollo Program, investing $400 billion in a National Institute of Clean Energy to invest in revolutionary clean energy tech. And I will require that production from this R;D takes place here in the U.S.‚Äîno excuses.
With bold investments, we can fight climate change, achieve the ambitious targets of the Green New Deal, and create more than a million good jobs here at home. I have a plan to invest at least $2 trillion in green research, manufacturing, and exporting: 
This is not a question of more or less government: It‚Äôs about who the government works for. And in the weeks ahead, I‚Äôll be releasing more plans on how this vision of economic patriotism should shape our economy, from trade policy to Wall Street. Here's my first proposal:
My administration will boost American workers‚Äîand I've already got a plan for that. We'll start with a new federal agency with one mission: Defend ; create American jobs. That agency will use aggressive new tools to boost American workers, not Wall Street. 
Giant companies who like to call themselves "American" have one real loyalty: Their shareholders. They'll ship jobs overseas and hollow out our cities if it'll save them a nickel. For too long, Washington politicians have let them call the shots. But not on my watch.

How are giant corporations getting away with this? Because the  lowered their effective tax rate to the lowest it‚Äôs been since 1947. My Real Corporate Profits Tax would make sure the biggest and most profitable corporations pay their fair share.

I‚Äôm heartsick and praying for the victims and their loved ones. Eleven people should not have been murdered today. How many lives will it take before Congress acts to end this crisis? 
Glad to see Colorado‚Äîand Maine‚Äîofficially ban cruel conversion therapy this week. LGBTQ+ Americans should feel free to be who they are and live without fear or discrimination. I won‚Äôt stop fighting for them. 
This is a win‚Äîbut safe, legal abortion access for women in Missouri and across the country is still under attack. Extreme lawmakers are hell-bent on overturning  and it‚Äôs more important than ever that we make our voices heard and

Website or no website, let‚Äôs be clear: Giant tech companies like Apple have too much power. In order to protect our economy and our democracy, we need to  and level the playing field for everyone else. 
This is a clear conflict of interest. We need to pull corruption out of Washington by the roots‚Äîand we can start with my plan to  the most ambitious anti-corruption plan since Watergate. 
Our democracy only works if everyone can be held accountable. These changes will make sure that‚Äôs the case for generations to come. Read my full plan here: 
I pledge to nominate an Office of Legal Counsel head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a president cannot be indicted for criminal behavior. The OLC‚Äôs purpose is to govern the conduct of the executive branch, not act as the president‚Äôs get-out-of-jail-free card.
Attorney General Bill Barr has disgraced himself by acting like Trump‚Äôs personal defense attorney. When I‚Äôm elected, I will appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one‚Äînot even a president‚Äîis above the law. And I‚Äôll go one step further:
One of the strongest arguments against indictment is that the Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to decide when to interfere with the President's duties. These new laws would eliminate that argument and remove any statutory ambiguity.
Congress should pass a law clarifying that DOJ can indict the president if he or she commits a crime in office, and should amend our obstruction of justice statutes to explicitly allow for indictment when the President abuses the powers of the office‚Äîlike Donald Trump did.
No president should be above the law. So why does this Justice Department act like he is? Because in the 1970s Richard Nixon‚Äôs Justice Department wrote a memo saying so (yes, really) and DOJ has continued to stand by that view.
The Mueller report is a clear roadmap for impeachment, because that‚Äôs the only path Mueller had. But impeachment shouldn‚Äôt be the only way that a president can be held accountable for committing a crime.
The Mueller report details crimes by the president that would lead to the indictment of any other citizen. But Mueller couldn‚Äôt bring charges because a Justice Department policy says you can‚Äôt charge a sitting president. That policy is wrong and needs to go. Here‚Äôs how and why.
See you soon, California! Our organizing event in Oakland is tomorrow‚Äîwill I see you there?

The time for small ideas is over. If we are going to save our democracy and build an economy that works for everyone, if we‚Äôre going to clean up the corruption in Washington, we need big, structural changes. And I have a plan for that. We‚Äôll win for CA and for all Americans.

When the Mueller report came out on April 18th, I read it. The next day, I told this is a point of principle. 
Mueller leaves no doubt:1) He didn't exonerate the president because there is evidence he committed crimes.2) Justice Department policy prevented him from charging the president with any crimes. 3) The Constitution leaves it up to Congress to act‚Äîand that's impeachment.
Mueller‚Äôs statement makes clear what those who have read his report know: It is an impeachment referral, and it‚Äôs up to Congress to act. They should.
He‚Äôs always so happy to see me (even if I‚Äôm just coming home from the grocery store).

Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional right and Congress can act to protect it. We‚Äôre going to fight every right-wing lawmaker‚Äôs attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
The fight for full LGBTQ+ equality is far from over. But I‚Äôm glad to see the House passed the Equality Act today to ban discrimination, protect transgender rights, and resist the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to roll back our progress.

When I was growing up, before Roe v. Wade, people still got abortions. Some were lucky. Others weren‚Äôt. They all went through hell. The overwhelming majority of Americans have no desire to return to the world before Roe. Add your name if you‚Äôre ready to fight back.
Congress should create federal, statutory rights that parallel Roe‚Äôs protections. We must ensure that choice remains the law ‚Äî even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Add your name if you‚Äôre with me, and let‚Äôs fight to get this done.
Congress should pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care from right-wing ideologues in the states: federal laws that ensure real access to birth control and abortion care for all women. Add your name if you‚Äôre with me, and let‚Äôs fight to get this done.

Sixty-five years ago today, SCOTUS decided on the landmark Brown v. Board of Education: Hateful school segregation laws are unconstitutional. It was an important ruling, but it didn‚Äôt end systemic racism in our country. We need to keep calling out racism every chance we get.
When I was growing up, people still got abortions. Some were lucky‚Äîothers weren't. They all went through hell. The overwhelming majority of Americans don‚Äôt want to return to that time. Congress should act to ensure that the will of the people remains the law of the land.
And the women of color who have led the repro justice movement teach us that these issues are bigger than Roe. We must go beyond abortion to ensure access to contraception, STI prevention ; care, sex ed, care for pregnant moms, safe home ; work environments, good wages, ; more.
Finally, we must ensure equal access to health care and support reproductive justice. Systemic barriers have made it especially difficult for low-income women and women of color to get the access to reproductive care they need.
Congress must guarantee reproductive health coverage as part of all health coverage. That starts with repealing the Hyde Amendment. Congress must also pass the EACH Woman Act, which would also prohibit abortion restrictions on private insurance.
Next, Congress should pass federal laws to preempt state efforts to pass Targeted Regulations on Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws, which are designed to functionally limit and eliminate women‚Äôs access to abortion care with medically-unnecessary restrictions.
Popular new federal rights that parallel Roe would preempt state laws like the AL, GA, ; OH bans. They'd end the political games played by right-wing courts to narrow Roe‚Äôs protections. And they'd ensure that choice remains the law‚Äîeven if the Supreme Court overturns Roe.
First, Congress should create federal, statutory rights that parallel Roe‚Äôs protections. We must prohibit states from interfering in the ability of a health professional to provide medical care‚Äîincluding abortion care‚Äî; from interfering in the ability of a patient to access care.
We should pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care from right-wing ideologues in the states and ensure access to birth control and abortion care. Laws that will stand no matter what the Supreme Court does. Here‚Äôs what that looks like: 
Our next President can begin to undo some of the damage by appointing neutral and fair judges who actually respect the law and cases like Roe instead of right-wing ideologues bent on rolling back our rights. But Congress has a role to play as well.
They‚Äôre hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play, and it might work. Donald Trump packed the courts with extreme, anti-choice judges. Senate Republicans stole a SCOTUS seat ; rammed through Justice Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation in order to cement an anti-choice majority.
Right-wing lawmakers in Alabama just enacted the most extreme abortion ban in over 40 years, the latest in a wave of abortion bans across the country in states like Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Ohio. Republicans are on the march to overturn Roe v. Wade.
I agree. NAFTA 2.0 is a bad deal that works great for Big Pharma, but leaves workers in the dust. We need to fix it. 
If there was ever a time for more women to run for office, it‚Äôs now. 
Defense contractor influence is a big part of how we ended up with a bloated Pentagon budget that will cost more this year than Ronald Reagan spent at the height of the Cold War. It‚Äôs wasteful. It‚Äôs unsustainable. And it doesn‚Äôt keep us safe.

Kermit, West Virginia was slammed by the opioid crisis‚Äîand not by accident. Big pharmaceutical companies pumped 13 million prescription pills into this little town. In fact, these companies made $17 billion shipping opioids to West Virginia. Time for some accountability. 
My plan will: ‚ÄîShut the revolving door between giant contractors and the Pentagon‚ÄîBan DoD officials from owning contractor stock‚ÄîLimit foreign government hiring of American national security officials‚ÄîExpose defense contractor lobbying
It‚Äôs wrong, wasteful, and bad for our national security. We have to call this what it is: corruption‚Äîplain and simple. I‚Äôve already introduced a sweeping anti-corruption bill. Today, I introduced the Department of Defense Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act. 
It‚Äôs time to cut our bloated defense budget. And that influence is a big part of how we ended up with a Pentagon budget that'll cost more this year than we spend on education, medical research, housing, disaster relief‚Äîeverything else in the discretionary budget put together.
These giant contractors have deployed an extremely profitable strategy: First, recruit armies of lobbyists from former Pentagon officials and congressional staffers. Then, get those former officials to use their relationships, access, and influence to secure lucrative contracts.
The coziness between defense lobbyists, Congress, and the Pentagon tilts countless decisions, big and small, away from legitimate national security interests and toward the desires of giant corporations that thrive off taxpayer dollars.
Betsy DeVos hasn‚Äôt spent a day in the classroom teaching our students. I‚Äôm pledging to change that. Under a Warren administration, the Secretary of Education will be a former public school teacher. 
Skyrocketing housing costs are squeezing families to the breaking point, and too many families are suffering from the legacy of racist housing policies. I'm proud to fight alongside for big ideas that will help us fix this crisis. 
I'm glad to see institutions like the holding the Sacklers accountable. But we have to go further. Under my Corporate Executive Accountability Act, people like the Sacklers, who get rich off of the opioid crisis, could face criminal penalties.

When I was growing up, people got abortions. Desperate women turned to back alley butchers or even tried the procedure on their own. Some were lucky, but others weren't. They all went through hell. Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional RIGHT. Full stop.

We don‚Äôt have to choose between a green military and an effective one. My plan will improve our service members‚Äô readiness and safety, and achieve cost savings for American taxpayers. Together, we can fight climate change‚Äîand win.
The Pentagon is the single largest government consumer of energy, and it‚Äôs dependent on fossil fuels. To improve military readiness and help us achieve a  the Pentagon should achieve net zero carbon emissions for all its non-combat bases and infrastructure by 2030.
Today, I am introducing my Defense Climate Resiliency and Readiness Act to harden the U.S. military against the threat posed by climate change, and to leverage its huge energy footprint as part of our climate solution. 
Senior military leaders have warned Congress of the national security challenge that climate change poses. The military is taking steps to become more energy efficient and resilient. But instead of meeting this threat head on, Washington is ignoring it‚Äîand making it worse.
Climate change is real, it‚Äôs worsening by the day, and it‚Äôs undermining our military readiness. More and more, accomplishing the mission depends on our ability to continue operations in the face of floods, drought, wildfires, desertification, and extreme cold.
 This is the most extreme and dangerous policy since Roe vs. Wade, banning abortion at any point in pregnancy ‚Äî going so far‚Ä¶
This ban is dangerous and exceptionally cruel‚Äîand the bill‚Äôs authors want to use it to overturn Roe v. Wade. I've lived in that America and let me tell you: We are not going back‚Äînot now, not ever. We will fight this. And we will win. 
Because of greedy pharmaceutical companies pumping drugs into town, Kermit, WV got hit hard by the opioid epidemic. I went there last week to say: Enough. I have a plan to end the opioid crisis and hold the people who caused it accountable.

I won‚Äôt do a town hall with Fox News because I won‚Äôt invite millions of Democratic primary voters to tune in, inflate ratings, and help sell ads for an outlet that profits from racism and hate. If you agree, sign our petition. 
I‚Äôve done 57 media avails and 131 interviews, taking over 1,100 questions from press just since January. Fox News is welcome to come to my events just like any other outlet. But a Fox News town hall adds money to the hate-for-profit machine. To which I say: hard pass.
I‚Äôm running a campaign to reach all Americans. I take questions from the press and voters everywhere I go. I‚Äôve already held town halls in 17 states and Puerto Rico‚Äîincluding WV, OH, GA, UT, TN, TX, CO, MS ; AL.
Here‚Äôs one place we can fight back: I won‚Äôt ask millions of Democratic primary voters to tune into an outlet that profits from racism and hate in order to see our candidates‚Äîespecially when Fox will make even more money adding our valuable audience to their ratings numbers.
But Fox News is struggling as more and more advertisers pull out of their hate-filled space. A Democratic town hall gives the Fox News sales team a way to tell potential sponsors it's safe to buy ads on Fox‚Äîno harm to their brand or reputation (spoiler: It‚Äôs not).
Hate-for-profit works only if there‚Äôs profit, so Fox News balances a mix of bigotry, racism, and outright lies with enough legit journalism to make the claim to advertisers that it‚Äôs a reputable news outlet. It‚Äôs all about dragging in ad money‚Äîbig ad money.
Fox News is a hate-for-profit racket that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to turn us against each other, risking life and death consequences, to provide cover for the corruption that‚Äôs rotting our government and hollowing out our middle class.

Authoritarian tendencies. Gleefully undermining democracy. Corruption. No wonder Viktor Orb√°n was so warmly welcomed by Donald Trump yesterday. 
Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education we‚Äôve seen. Instead of championing our students, she protects for-profit colleges that break the law. So I‚Äôm making a pledge: In a Warren administration, the Secretary of Education will be a former public school teacher. 
I grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class. My family didn‚Äôt have money for a college application‚Äîlet alone college. I dropped out of school at 19 to get married. My second chance was a commuter college that cost $50 a semester‚Äîand I hung on for dear life. 
When pharmaceutical CEOs pad their pockets and commit criminal negligence while pushing drugs, they should go to jail. 
Family farmers across the country are being squeezed by the Trump administration‚Äôs terrible policies. Our farmers deserve better. 
Feeling inspired after the  town hall this afternoon. I‚Äôll always stand behind our teachers and their right to unionize. Thank you and for letting me be part of today‚Äôs powerful conversation. 
Thank you for the questions and powerful conversation about teaching in America. 
We need a Secretary of Education who actually cares about our teachers and students. 
In my administration, the Secretary of Education will be a former public school teacher who is committed to public education. Add your name if you agree that we need to replace Betsy DeVos with someone who actually fights for our kids. 
The next Secretary of Education should be a former public school teacher‚Äîsomeone who will fight for students and not for shady, for-profit colleges. 
I‚Äôll be speaking at the  town hall about how we can level the playing field for America‚Äôs public school teachers. Tune in at 4:30 PM ET today.

And we need to make it easier to join a union. Unions give teachers‚Äîand all workers‚Äîpower in negotiations over the long run. That's good for teachers, good for students, and good for making sure we put the resources we need directly into our schools.
My Secretary of Education will be someone with real teaching experience, who understands how low pay, tattered textbooks and crumbling classrooms affect educators and students. Someone who understands the crushing burden of student debt and will fight back.
But Betsy DeVos is just a symptom of a badly broken system. We‚Äôre up against powerful forces, and to win, we need big structural change. So here‚Äôs my plan: Under a Warren administration, the Secretary of Education will be a public school teacher. 
There's no greater example of how we're failing students and teachers than Betsy DeVos, the worst Secretary of Education we‚Äôve seen. Appointed despite her conflicts of interest, she's spent her time protecting for-profit colleges that break the law and cheat students.
America‚Äôs teachers are being crushed. Too many teachers are working multiple jobs, drowning in student debt, and struggling to teach on shoestring budgets and insulting salaries. America is failing our teachers‚Äîand when we fail our teachers, we fail our future.
Ever since I was little, I wanted to be a teacher. My 2nd grade teacher, Mrs. Lee, was the first person to tell me that I could be a teacher too. And thanks to a high quality, public education, I did become a teacher. I want kids today to have the same opportunities I did.

We‚Äôve had over 70 town halls and we do a selfie line after each one. Not only is it fun, it‚Äôs when I get to listen to people‚Äôs stories. I‚Äôm so glad I got to take my 20,000th selfie yesterday with Umeirra in Cincinnati. 
Black moms are dying from childbirth-related causes at rates 3-4 times higher than white moms‚Äîand structural racism is the root cause of this problem. We need to call it out, and then fight back. 
On  I‚Äôm thinking about Black and Brown moms in our country. Women of color are dying from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes at staggering rates and it is the direct result of institutional and structural racism. We need to call it out and address it head on. 
My mother didn‚Äôt have much, but she knew that her kids had a fighting chance to build a future. Today, not every family has that fighting chance. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm fighting for to honor my mother, on Mother‚Äôs Day and every day. 
For a long time, I thought that was just a story about my mother. And then years later, I came to understand that it's a story about millions of Americans who‚Äîno matter how scared they are‚Äîreach down, dig deep, find it, and pull up what they need to take care of the family.
I watched her while she pulled it together, put that dress on, put on her high heels, blew her nose, walked to Sears, and got a minimum wage job. And that minimum wage job saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family. That story is written on my heart.
Spread out on the bed was a black dress. It was that one dress that every mom had‚Äîit only came out for weddings, funerals, and graduations. She kept saying, ‚ÄúWe will not lose this house. We will not lose this house.‚Äù She‚Äôd never worked outside the home, and she was terrified.
Happy  Today, I‚Äôm honoring my mother. One morning after my daddy‚Äôs heart attack, I remember standing in their bedroom. Her face was red and puffy, with wadded-up tissues next to her. We‚Äôd just lost our family station wagon. Our house was next.
Yay! Thanks for coming today and taking a selfie with me, Umeirra. 
Communities in NH and across the country are getting squeezed by opioids. They‚Äôre fighting back, but they can‚Äôt do it alone. We need to step up, and I have a plan to provide real resources to the states and communities affected by the opioid crisis. 
The energy in Columbus last night made me feel grateful down to my bones. We're going to dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020. 
Alabama‚Äôs anti-abortion bill is dangerous and unconstitutional. I‚Äôm grateful to the Democratic lawmakers who are fighting their hearts out to protect women‚Äôs rights to control our own bodies. I‚Äôm with you all the way. 
Earlier this week, I wanted to make sure I called some of the teachers who have donated to our campaign to thank them.  
This photo was taken the moment I asked people in the room if they knew someone or had been directly affected by the opioid epidemic. This crisis is hitting communities hard, ; I'm grateful for the important conversation in Chillicothe. If we fight hard, we can fix this together. 
We need to call out the history of discrimination in education, and honor the role HBCUs play in our country. Thank you for the opportunity. 
As folks came through the photo line after our town hall in Kermit, West Virginia, a few of them pressed notes into my hand. I took a moment as we left town to read them. 
Thank you to Kermit, West Virginia, for your warm hospitality today. This small but mighty town is fighting hard to hold massive corporations accountable for fueling the opioid crisis in their community‚Äîand I'm proud to join them in this fight. 
Checking out the Kermit Public Library was fun. One day we might even be able to see a book about our country‚Äôs first woman president. 
Today, 191 people will die from a drug overdose. I‚Äôm in this fight for everyone who‚Äôs been caught in the grips of addiction, or knows someone who is. By holding drug companies accountable and giving communities the money and tools to fight addiction, we can end the opioid crisis. 
When a corporate executive is criminally negligent and people get hurt, that executive should face jail time. 
 Biggest applause so far in Kermit, West Virginia: on accountability for corporations and executives for their role fueling the‚Ä¶
I asked the crowd at my Kermit town hall to raise their hands if someone they know has been caught in the grips of addiction‚Äînearly every hand went up. We need a massive investment to end this crisis‚Äîwhich is why I want to invest $100 billion to end it.  
This crisis has been driven by greed, pure and simple, and it‚Äôs time to change that. I‚Äôve got a plan to make these companies pay up to ensure every person gets the care they need. 
Here‚Äôs the truth: Fueling addiction is big business. The five companies being sued by Kermit earned $17 billion shipping prescription opioids to West Virginia during those few years, and their CEOs took home millions in bonuses and pay.
This small but mighty town filed a lawsuit against the pharmacy and five of the wholesale drug distributors who exacerbated the crisis. And it‚Äôs just one of many similar lawsuits lodged by towns, counties, and states across the country.
The companies shipping these pills repeatedly disregarded requirements to report suspicious patterns of behavior, and the state Board of Pharmacy failed to enforce its own rules. But Kermit is fighting back.
Over a period of just a few years, this town of only 400 people was flooded with approximately 13 million prescription opioid pills‚Äî‚Ääthat‚Äôs more than 30,000 pills per resident‚Äîall delivered to a single local pharmacy‚Ää.
Today, I went to Kermit, a small town along the Kentucky-West Virginia border that‚Äôs been hard-hit by the opioid epidemic‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand not by accident. I‚Äôll tell you why.
The opioid epidemic is crushing communities across the country. My plan to fix it, the  would provide $100 billion in federal funding directly to communities like Bethlehem, NH. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed to make sure every single person gets the treatment they need. 
Governor Sununu‚Äôs veto of paid family and medical leave is absolutely shameful. Without paid leave, too many people will have to choose between their families and their paychecks. I'm going to fight for paid family and medical leave for every family.

My debt cancellation plan helps 42M lower-income ; middle-class families‚Äîand we'll pay for it with a 2 cent tax on the 75,000 richest fortunes. It also invests $50B in HBCUs ; Minority-Serving Institutions. Find out how much relief you'd receive here. 
My plan has broad public support, including from people who never had students loans or finished paying off their loans already. Americans are big-hearted‚Äîthey recognize how this proposal would help millions of families and boost the economy for everyone. 
This is just part of my plan for ending the student debt crisis with broad student loan debt cancellation and universal free college. Since the release of my plan, people across America have described the incredible difference it could make in their lives. 
Bank lobbyists claimed that changing the bankruptcy rules for student loans would reduce costs. Instead, costs went up and private student lending exploded. It was great for banks and bad for students. Congress should pass our bill to change this law immediately.
In 2005, Congress passed a bad bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to stay afloat‚Äîincluding by making it nearly impossible for people to get rid of student loans in bankruptcy. Today, and I introduced a bill to change that.
We‚Äôre headed to West Virginia and Ohio this weekend. Hope to see you there (or at an upcoming organizing event near you). 
My proposal for an Ultra-Millionaire Tax on the largest fortunes in America would pay for plans like student loan debt cancellation, universal free college, universal child care, and ending the opioid epidemic. And we‚Äôd still have more than half a trillion dollars left over.

Yesterday, Mitch McConnell stepped onto the Senate floor saying ‚Äúcase closed‚Äù on the Mueller report.I don‚Äôt think so. 
Under my plan, the people who profited by causing the opioid crisis would pay up to help make sure every person gets the care they need. If you agree that we need big, structural change to take on the opioid epidemic, then become a citizen co-sponsor of the CARE Act today.

Let‚Äôs be clear: This bill, and others across the country like it, put women in danger. Women should have the right to control our own bodies. We won‚Äôt go back. Not now‚Äînot ever. 
Under my plan, billionaires that got rich off of this crisis would pay to help ensure every person gets the care they need. And under my Corporate Executive Accountability Act, executives who deliberately hurt people through criminal negligence will face real criminal penalties.
That's a start. But this crisis has been driven by greed, pure and simple. To solve it, we need to hold business executives that cheat, defraud, and addict people accountable.
The CARE Act also works to strengthen our addiction treatment infrastructure‚Äîdemanding states use Medicaid to its fullest to tackle the crisis, expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, and ensuring treatment programs and recovery residences meet high standards.
These resources would support the whole continuum of care, from early intervention, to harm reduction, to long-term support services. They would ensure access to mental health services and help provide critical wraparound services like housing support and medical transportation.
Today, Rep. Cummings ; I‚Äîalong with 80+ cosponsors‚Äîare rolling out the CARE Act, a comprehensive plan to end the opioid crisis by providing states ; communities $100 billion over the next 10 years to ensure every single person gets the treatment they need. 
70,000 Americans died in 2017 from a drug overdose‚Äîthe majority due to opioids. Emergency room visits for opioid overdoses are skyrocketing, and too many are still not receiving treatment. This is a public health crisis. And it has also severely impacted communities of color.
Heartsick for the victims, their loved ones, and the Highlands Ranch community. How many more of our children‚Äôs schools must be torn apart by gun violence until Congress does something? We need gun reform. Now.

The flooding across eastern Iowa is just one example of how climate change is affecting us in real time. It‚Äôs our moral obligation to fight for our planet before it‚Äôs too late. Thank you for stepping up and helping the community, Karen! 
A hostile foreign power attacked our democracy. The president welcomed that attack, obstructed the investigation into it, ; is now cozying up with the leader who orchestrated it. Congress needs to do its job, stand up for our national security, and begin impeachment proceedings. 
Health care is a human right, and we fight for human rights. 
Grace from New Hampshire is absolutely right. My new plan to cancel student debt for 95% of Americans and make public college free would level the playing field for all of our students‚Äînot just a select few. 
About a third of US student loan debt is held by people over the age of 40. The student loan debt crisis is a burden on all of us, and my plan to cancel debt for 95% of Americans with student loan debt helps everyone get ahead. 
Candidates for president don‚Äôt always go to Utah or Tennessee or Alabama because they aren‚Äôt battleground states. But this is a 50-state campaign, and I'm traveling to every corner of our country because I‚Äôm running to be president of the entire United States.

On Yom HaShoah, we pause to remember the millions of victims of the Holocaust. This year, Remembrance Day falls in the shadow of yet another attack on a synagogue. We must keep fighting anti-Semitism, bigotry, racism, and hate.

En Estados Unidos, se necesita un liderazgo que respete a todos sus ciudadanos‚Äîy en el caso de Puerto Rico, el respeto significa poner las vidas de millones de ciudadanos por encima de los m√°rgenes de ganancia de Wall Street. 
Puerto Rico shows us a clear example of how well the federal government works for Wall Street and how poorly it works for everyone else. I believe we should fight back‚Äîand treat Puerto Rico with respect. 
Crippling student loan debt is holding families back. My new plan would change that for Valerie from South Carolina, and millions of other Americans across the country. 
Esta legislaci√≥n establecer√≠a una avenida para el alivio comprensivo de la deuda de Puerto Rico. Puedes leer todos los detalles aqu√≠. 
Los ejecutivos de Wall Street ven la desesperaci√≥n en la isla como una oportunidad para obtener ganancias‚Äîy eso me da asco. Por eso estoy presentado nuevamente el Acta de Alivio para los Territorios Estadounidenses.
El Congreso tuvo la oportunidad de romper con el control de Wall Street. En vez de hacerlo, aprobaron una legislaci√≥n llamada PROMESA, estableciendo una junta de supervisi√≥n fiscal que exigi√≥ recortes a servicios b√°sicos, coartando la posibilidad de recuperaci√≥n para PR.
Sin embargo, por causa de su estatus √∫nico, esas avenidas legales no est√°n a su alcance. Gran parte de la deuda est√° en manos de Wall Street, quienes intentan exprimir hasta el √∫ltimo centavo de ganancia.
Si Puerto Rico fuera una corporaci√≥n grande o una ciudad en los Estados Unidos en este tipo de crisis financiera, podr√≠a declararse en bancarrota: pagando parte de su deuda, liquidando el resto y as√≠ comenzar a reconstruir.
Los huracanes Irma y Mar√≠a devastaron a Puerto Rico y a los millones de ciudadanos estadounidenses que viven en la isla. Queda claro que la respuesta de la administraci√≥n de Trump fue inefectiva, pero una de las mayores limitaciones frenando la recuperaci√≥n recae en su deuda.
Wall Street executives see the island‚Äôs desperation as just another opportunity to make a profit‚Äîand it makes me sick. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm re-introducing the U.S. Territorial Relief Act to provide Puerto Rico with a path to comprehensive debt relief. 
Much of Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt is held by Wall Street, which is trying to squeeze out every last penny of profit. Congress had a chance to break Wall Street's grip. Instead, they passed PROMESA, imposing an oversight board which has slashed services, hindering the recovery.
If Puerto Rico were a big company or an American city in this kind of financial trouble, it could file for bankruptcy, pay some of its debts, discharge the rest, then start rebuilding. But because of its unique status, those legal options aren‚Äôt available.
Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the millions of U.S. citizens who live there. The Trump Administration's response was slow and ineffective‚Äîbut one of the biggest constraints holding back the recovery has been Puerto Rico's debt.
My three big brothers served in the military: Don Reed and John joined the Air Force, and David joined the Army. I‚Äôm glad I got to talk with and listen to military families in Nevada on Saturday. They deserve better and you bet I‚Äôm going to keep fighting for them. 
Hate has no place in our country. The threat of white nationalism is real. And when I'm president, the Justice Department will prosecute domestic terrorists to the full extent of the law.
The American people know we must take bold steps to address our student debt crisis. By asking the top 0.1% to pay their fair share, we can cancel student loans for 42 million Americans. That wouldn‚Äôt just help our students, it would help all of us.

Donald Trump isn‚Äôt king, and no one is above the law. We know Barr's deceptive "summary" was intended to protect the man in the White House, and Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the President. 
This is outrageous. We need answers on how obtained surveillance data from family separation protests and how that data was used. 
I read the whole Mueller report. It's clear that Donald Trump obstructed an investigation into an attack on America and into his own behavior. Presidents are not above the law, and Congress has a constitutional duty to start impeachment proceedings. If you agree, add your name.
AG Barr is a disgrace, and his alarming efforts to suppress the Mueller report show that he's not a credible head of federal law enforcement. He should resign‚Äîand based on the actual facts in the Mueller report, Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the President.

I've read the Mueller report, and one thing is very clear: Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetime, and Congress should begin impeachment proceedings. No one is above the law. Not even the President. 
I'm heartsick for the victims of the  shooting and their family, friends, and classmates. Schools should be a safe haven for students and faculty, but again we see a horrific act of violence on a school campus. Enough is enough.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's letter objecting to the Attorney General's characterization of his report confirms what we already suspected: Barr's "summary" was a willfully deceptive interpretation intended to protect the man in the White House.

This is a campaign of ideas‚Äîand you bet I have a lot of them. It‚Äôs about identifying what‚Äôs broken and how we‚Äôre going to make the structural change to fix it. 
Some giant companies make billions of dollars in profits but pay $0 in corporate income tax. My Real Corporate Profits Tax would make big and profitable companies pay their fair share and ensure none of them ever pay zero taxes again. 
Thank you, Ady. I‚Äôm so grateful to call you my friend. We‚Äôre in this fight together. 
Karen from New Hampshire has seen first hand how students are getting crushed by mountains of student loan debt. By making public colleges free and canceling student debt for 95% of Americans, we‚Äôll do good by our students and our economy. 
Every year that Washington keeps working for the rich and the powerful, Medicare is more likely to come under attack. Enough is enough. We need to protect and expand Medicare. 
It was great meeting you, too. Unions built the middle class and unions will rebuild the middle class. I‚Äôm with you all the way.

Outrageous. Filing taxes should be simple and free. Big financial corporations like TurboTax shouldn‚Äôt be able to scam consumers like this‚Äîand my Tax Simplification Act would fix that. 
For most candidates, ‚Äúcall time‚Äù means calling wealthy donors and asking for money. Not me. I‚Äôm spending ‚Äúcall time‚Äù thanking small-dollar, grassroots donors who give what they can. Chip in what you can, and you might get a call from me to say thank you:  
Busy weekend in Iowa and Nevada. Somebody was waiting for me to come home! 
Unions built America‚Äôs middle class and unions will rebuild America‚Äôs middle class. Thanks and for inviting me to speak at the  
Thank you, Iowa, for the warm welcome and for helping make Bruce‚Äôs birthday weekend truly special! We look forward to seeing you again soon. 
I was proud to take the  pledge‚Äînow let's do the work we need to do to defeat Trump in 2020. 
I'm heartsick for the victims of today's horrific attack at the Chabad of Poway and their families. No one should ever have to face hatred and violence in a place of worship. It's on all of us to stand up to the rising threat of anti-semitism, racism, and hate.
As I told we've got to get organized, get mobilized, and build a grassroots movement if we want to make big, structural change. And we'll need a president who is willing to fight for it every inch of the way. 
On her birthday, we remember activist and civil rights hero Coretta Scott King. Her powerful voice continues to resonate across the country‚Äîand we will never let anyone silence it. Nevertheless, we persist.
The food‚Äîand Bruce‚Äîwere both better than ever. Happy birthday, sweetie. 
I ordered him a huge lunch, and he wolfed down every bite. At the end, he said he loved it. Right then, I knew this was a guy I could live with forever. This week we were back in Houston for She the People, and we went back to Ninfa‚Äôs.
The first time Bruce came to Houston to meet my family, I picked him up at the airport and drove him directly to my favorite Tex-Mex place, Ninfa‚Äôs on Navigation. He‚Äôd grown up in Massachusetts and everything in this part of the world was new.
Today is Bruce's birthday, so yesterday we celebrated with cake. I‚Äôm very lucky to have him by my side this weekend in Iowa‚Äîand for all of life‚Äôs big adventures. Happy birthday, Bruce! 
Surprise, surprise. The man in the White House wants to give a top government job to another one of his rich buddies. Barry Myers is a walking conflict of interest who doesn't belong anywhere near 
I‚Äôm so glad to have you on our team, Dan! 
Here's my plan: We fight side by side, 
On  I want to be clear: You matter. We see you. We won‚Äôt stop fighting until everyone is free to love without fear or discrimination.
People come up to me, introduce themselves, and then tell me how much student loan debt they have. Their debt is keeping them from buying homes, starting businesses, and pursuing the careers they want. It's time to cancel the debt that is crushing an entire generation. 
Universal child care. Affordable housing. Student loan debt cancellation and universal free college. Yup, I‚Äôve got a plan for that‚Äîand more.
Coastal communities have made it clear: No more offshore drilling that hurts our planet. On day one of a Warren administration, I promise to sign a total moratorium on new offshore drilling. 
This week at I was asked if I‚Äôm afraid voters will think white male candidates are ‚Äúsafer‚Äù than voting for a woman.I‚Äôm not afraid‚Äînot by a long shot. 
Today, I‚Äôm thinking about the Iowans whose lives were torn apart by intense flooding this spring, and the first responders who are helping keep people safe. Climate change is real‚Äîand we need big, structural change to tackle it head on.
Yesterday‚Äôs meet and greet in Linn County was a meaningful one. People are fired up for big, structural change. 
Today I‚Äôm rolling out a plan to improve our military housing, protect families from abuse, and hold private developers accountable. The very least we owe those who proudly defend our country and their families is a safe, affordable place to live. 
Military families have been living with lead paint, faulty wiring, ceilings collapsing, and mice infestations. Mold has taken over entire rooms. Kids are getting sick from living in these homes. That's not how we should treat our servicemembers‚Äîand it needs to stop now.
A handful of private developers have taken over 99% of domestic military family housing. Driven by short-term payoffs and with no meaningful oversight, contractors have failed to maintain the homes they were entrusted with‚Äîand families are suffering the consequences.
The legacy of racist redlining practices still haunts Black and Brown communities. It‚Äôs wrong. Yesterday at  I talked about my new housing plan that would level the playing field for communities of color. 
New Hampshire is getting squeezed by our country‚Äôs opioid epidemic. Last month I had the opportunity to visit Friendship House, an opioid treatment center in Bethlehem, and had powerful conversations with patients about how we can end this crisis. 
I wanted to be a teacher since 2nd grade. Here I am with my doll collection‚ÄîI used to line them up and play ‚Äúschool.‚Äù Later, I had the chance to be a special education teacher and a law professor because America invested in kids like me. We need to invest in kids again.  
More proof that Amazon has too much power. Tech monopolies hurt small businesses, innovation, and consumers. 
Thank you for a great conversation, 
Five years. An entire generation of children has lived all or most of their lives without access to clean, safe water. Activists like have been fighting tirelessly for Flint‚Äîbut we must do better to ensure no community ever faces a crisis like this ever again. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs White House is a product of a system that‚Äôs rigged in favor of the rich and the powerful. But this is our time to change that. Join our fight to win in 2020 and return the power to the people:  
This is despicable. A young life was lost and a family is grieving because of anti-LGBTQ+ comments like these. My thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of Nigel Shelby. To the LGBTQ+ community: You are loved. You matter. You are deserving. 
Climate change is real and it is here‚Äîjust ask farmers in Iowa who have felt the change in growing seasons, excessive flooding, and about $2 billion in damage to communities. We need real solutions like a  we need them now. 
There is a student loan debt crisis, and it‚Äôs holding an entire generation back‚Äîfrom reducing home ownership rates to forcing students to drop out of school before getting a degree. It‚Äôs unacceptable and I want to change that.  
In Iowa, I met family farmers who are getting squeezed by decades of policies that favor giant agribusinesses like Bayer-Monsanto. Time for better policy choices‚Ää. Learn more about my plan to level the playing field for America‚Äôs family farmers:  
Giant agribusinesses like these have too much power, and family farms are getting hurt. My plan to level the playing field for America‚Äôs farmers tackles consolidation in the agriculture sector head on. 
This is a slap on the wrist‚Äîa fraction of the profits Facebook makes in a year. Facebook is a repeat offender ; fines like this won‚Äôt stop them from breaking the law ; violating our privacy again. It's going to take big, structural change.  
You have to pay something back so that everyone gets a chance. If we put a 2% tax on the wealthiest families in the country, we can have universal Pre-K, universal free college, knock back student loan debt for 95% of Americans‚Äîand still have a trillion dollars leftover.
I‚Äôm so grateful for the work that does to register and turn out voters‚Äîit was so good to meet these powerful women and thank them for their work! 
We need bold solutions to the epidemic of maternal mortality in America.  Let‚Äôs talk to hospitals in the language they understand: money. Reduce the rate of maternal mortality or lose money. Sign up now to join our fight.
Let‚Äôs make it unacceptable for medical providers to tolerate high rates of moms dying‚Äîespecially Black moms. Under my plan, if providers deliver quality care to Black moms, they‚Äôll make more money. If they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll make less. Make providers pay until this crisis is fixed.
Black moms in our country are dying from childbirth-related causes 3-4 times more often than white moms. Let‚Äôs make it unacceptable for medical providers to tolerate the high rates of moms dying‚Äîespecially Black moms. Sign up now to join our fight.
What a powerful room. Honored and grateful down to my toes. Thank you, 
We have to right the wrongs for communities of color. And that starts by addressing the legacy of discrimination in our country. 
 at  I learned a fact: When your ears are stuffed with money, you can't hear well"SAY IT!!
Black moms in our country are dying from childbirth-related causes 3-4 times more often than white moms. Any meaningful solution to our maternal mortality crisis must address structural racism as a root cause of this problem. My new idea would tackle this crisis head on. 
Grateful to be part of such a powerful conversation at  this afternoon. Our country needs to do better by women of color‚Äîand for me, it starts with addressing and tackling the Black maternal mortality crisis head on. 
We've done this in other areas of health care. Let's do it here. If providers deliver quality care to Black moms, they‚Äôll make more. If they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll make less. Don't just observe and debate racism in health care. Make providers pay until this crisis is fixed. 
Advocates are forcing Black maternal mortality into the conversation. There are important ideas on the table. Here's mine: Hit health care providers in their wallets. Make it unacceptable for providers to tolerate our high rates of moms dying‚Äîespecially Black moms. 
The evidence all points in the same direction. The mistreatment of Black and Brown women around maternal health is the direct result of institutional and structural racism. We need bold solutions to the epidemic of maternal mortality in America. 
Moms in our country are dying from childbirth at rates almost 40% higher than in other wealthy countries‚Äîand the Black maternal mortality rate is 3-4 times higher than it is for white moms, across all income levels. We have to call it out. 
The treatment of women and infants is a direct reflection of the values of a society‚Äîand the U.S. has the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world. It's a national disgrace. Today, I talked about my idea to fix it. 
Student loan debt is holding back an entire generation and crushing families‚Äîbut we can change that. Jos√© Mar√≠a, Eva, Jayme, Alexandria, Tasha, Alicia, and Michael have big plans for what they could do if we cancel their debt. 
We need to start fixing our higher education system so it better serves everyone‚Äîincluding communities of color. That's why my plan invests a minimum of $50 billion in HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). 
I‚Äôm grateful for the conversations we had in Keene and Weare last weekend about the future of our country. We're going to do this together! 
 Something you may not have noticed about bold education plan: she's taking a stand for Veterans.Warren woul‚Ä¶
We need to act on climate change before it‚Äôs too late. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm making a promise. On the first day of a Warren administration, I‚Äôll sign a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases, including for drilling offshore and on public lands. 
We won‚Äôt go back on women‚Äôs health‚Äînot now, not ever. The Trump administration's gag rule is immoral, dangerous, and illegal. Period.  
Go, Jane! 
It was great meeting Ricardo at in South Carolina yesterday. I‚Äôm grateful that young people like him are in this fight all the way to cancel debt for 95% of Americans and make public colleges free. 
Young people in our country, like Aubrey from Utah, are getting absolutely crushed by student loan debt. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way and I‚Äôve got a plan to tackle the debt crisis head on. 
 I am a Navy veteran, with $50,000 in student loan debts.  I often struggle with work because of chronic pain from‚Ä¶

I want every girl to grow up knowing that they can fight from the heart‚Äîand that they can win. So when I meet a little girl on the campaign trail, I say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm running for president, because that‚Äôs what girls do.‚Äù And we pinky promise that they‚Äôll remember. 
When Amazon can tilt the online marketplace in its own favor, small businesses see an immediate impact in their profits. That can be absolutely crushing, it's not fair, and I‚Äôm fighting to end that. 
Finally, I said that Amazon was about 49% of all online retail sales. And yes, you are. What an odd thing to deliberately misconstrue. 
Second, Amazon's private label products are projected to reach $25 billion in online sales by 2022. An analyst said huge private label sales would give Amazon "a strong...competitive advantage": 
Oh boy. Here are the facts:First, there are multiple reports that Amazon is using the data it collects to copy successful goods sold by small businesses on the Amazon Marketplace and sell its own branded version.  
The first step to addressing the student debt crisis is to deal with the outstanding debt that's weighing down millions of families. My plan for broad student debt cancellation would cancel debt for more than 95% of the 45 million Americans with student loan debt. Join our fight.
Graduating college debt-free shouldn‚Äôt be a privilege for the ultra-wealthy. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proposing a federal investment in public higher education that will eliminate the cost of tuition + fees at every public two-year and four-year college. Sign up to join the fight.

Let‚Äôs be clear: Our  must count every single person. Our Constitution demands it, and our democracy requires it. 
My new plan for the cancellation of student loan debt applies to public technical schools, too. Wherever you pursue an education, you should be able to graduate without getting crushed by piles of debt. 
Thanks, I‚Äôm grateful for the work you do on this issue, including pushing NH to restore funding for public universities.

I was grateful to be at this morning, where we talked about how we can level the playing field for all our students‚Äînot just a select few. My new college debt plan would establish a minimum of $50 billion for HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions. 
We can make big, structural change‚Äîas long as we build a grassroots movement to fight for it. Add your name to say you support cancelling up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans and making universal free public college a reality. 
Our government needs to do right by Americans getting crushed by debt‚Äîincluding you, Sarah. I‚Äôm in this fight to end the student debt crisis all the way. 
I know we can make real, structural change for students like you, Olyvia. That‚Äôs what my new plan is all about.

My new plan would cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans, and completely wipe out student loan debt for more than 75% of Americans. This would free an entire generation of families from crushing debt and give our economy a boost.
Even better: I want to establish a *minimum* of $50 billion for HBCUs ; Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)! The Secretary of Ed. would increase the amount of money in the fund as needed to ensure that spending per-student at these schools is comparable to colleges in the area. 
This is personal because policy touches the lives of everyone in this country. Thanks for tuning in!  
Wow! Thanks for watching. We‚Äôre in this fight together. 
 We shouldn't even need to say this, but we agree "No coal lobbyists for head of the EPA."

I believe the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States. There is no political inconvenience exception to the United States Constitution. I explained my position tonight.  
Here‚Äôs the deal: Girls dream big, fight hard, and win.  
We‚Äôre not going to win this by name-calling or talking about Donald Trump. The way we‚Äôre going to do this is by talking about our vision and how it affects families across the country. Our economy and our democracy are at stake.  
When I first ran for office, I was told that people weren't ready to elect a woman. But I organized, built a grassroots movement, and fought for working people. And I won. That's how I'm going to be the first woman elected President of the United States.  
The student loan debt burden is crushing millions of families and acting as an anchor on our economy. That‚Äôs just wrong. My new plan would end this crisis and clean up the mess it‚Äôs caused. 
If we put a 2% tax on the wealthiest families in the country, we can provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, knock back student loan debt for 95% of Americans‚Äîand still have a trillion dollars leftover.  
I actually read the whole Mueller report. It‚Äôs clear Donald Trump obstructed an investigation into an attack on America and into his own behavior. Presidents are not above the law, and Congress has a constitutional duty to start impeachment proceedings.

Our criminal justice system has a problem with race right at the heart of it, and we need to call it out for what it is. No one is safer in a world where we have a broken criminal justice system.  
I took an oath to uphold our Constitution ; everyone else in Congress did too. If other members think we can ignore a president's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation, then they should have to take that vote‚Äîand live with it for the rest of their lives. 
If any other human being in this country did what was described in the Mueller report, they‚Äôd be in jail. This isn‚Äôt about politics‚Äîthis is about principle for me. We need to protect our democracy for generations to come. 
I stayed up late into the night reading the Mueller report. The facts are clear: A hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump‚Äîand Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, he obstructed the investigation into that attack. 
Right now in this country, Black Americans are far more likely to be arrested for marijuana use than white Americans. That‚Äôs not right. We need to legalize marijuana‚Äîand I have a bipartisan bill would end the federal ban on marijuana.

I‚Äôm calling for universal free college and the cancellation of student loan debt for more than 95% of Americans. This is the kind of big, structural change we need to make sure our kids have opportunity in this country. 
Finally, my plan will ban for-profit colleges from receiving any federal dollars. Time to cut off taxpayer money to schools that suck down billions while burying lower-income students, servicemembers, and students of color in mountains of debt.
We'll knock down artificial barriers to enrollment by prohibiting public colleges from considering citizenship status or criminal history in admissions decisions.
Next, my plan will dedicate $100 billion in new funding to help students cover non-tuition expenses at public colleges‚Äîa barrier that disproportionately affects lower-income students and students of color‚Äîto make zero debt at graduation a reality for everyone.
First, my plan will provide at least $50B‚Äîand potentially far more‚Äîto HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions. It‚Äôll also make additional funding available to states that demonstrate serious improvement in enrollment/graduation rates for lower-income students ; students of color.
Free tuition at public institutions isn‚Äôt enough. We must also make our higher education system better serve lower-income families and communities of color, and ensure everyone can graduate with zero debt. 
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proposing a historic new federal investment in public higher education that will eliminate the cost of tuition and fees at every public two-year and four-year college in America, plus an additional $100 billion investment in Pell Grants. 
I was able to get a quality, public education for just $50 a semester. That kind of opportunity is virtually impossible to find today. As states have invested less in community colleges and public four-year colleges, schools have raised tuition and fees to make up the gap.

 ‚ÄúDERAIL OR OBSTRUCT‚Äù: Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren urged lawmakers to open impeachment proc‚Ä¶
Today, I got asked a really important question in New Hampshire. This is a matter of principle, and here is why I‚Äôm in this fight all the way. 
I was out in Utah talking about environmental issues ; on the plane back, the Mueller report came out‚Äîso I started reading, ; read late into the night. The report hands this now to Congress ; the fundamental question for us is: "Is there going to be some accountability here?" 
LIVE: Yesterday I called on the House to begin impeachment proceedings. This is a matter of principle for me. 
I read the Mueller report.  When I got to the end, I realized this is a point of principle. Because it matters not just for this president, but for all future presidents. No one is above the law. 
The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.
To ignore a President‚Äôs repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways.
Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: ‚ÄúCongress has authority to prohibit a President‚Äôs corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.‚Äù The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment.
The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.
I‚Äôm grateful to everyone who packed into the Depot on Wednesday. Person by person, city by city, we‚Äôre building a grassroots movement to win in 2020‚Äîand I‚Äôm glad that Salt Lake City is in this fight all the way! 
With a stroke of his pen, the man in the White House rolled back protections for more than two million acres of our national lands. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. On my first day as president, I will commit to no new fossil fuel drilling on our public lands. Period. 
Surprise, surprise. Former secretary Ryan Zinke resigned because of too many ethics investigations. Now he‚Äôs taking a plum job at a company he used to regulate. It's corruption, plain and simple.

I‚Äôm making a promise. On the first day of a Warren administration, I will sign a moratorium on new fossil fuel drilling leases on public lands. Climate change is here, it is real, and we need to do something about it. 
Congress needs to see the full, unredacted report. Special Counsel Robert Mueller should testify before Congress and the American people as soon as possible. Add your name if you agree, and together, we‚Äôll fight to get to the bottom of this. 
Congress needs to see the full, unredacted  and Special Counsel Robert Mueller must testify publicly before Congress and the American people. If you agree, sign our petition now.
This is a disgrace. The American people deserve answers‚Äîand Special Counsel Robert Mueller should testify publicly before Congress.  
It's a disgrace to see an Attorney General acting as if he's the personal attorney and publicist for the President of the United States.
Salt Lake City is ready to dream big, and fight hard! 
I had a great time hiking through Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. This gorgeous place is one of our national treasures‚Äîand we have a moral obligation to protect it for our kids and our grandkids. 
I‚Äôm here in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest with Carl Fisher, executive director of a nonprofit dedicated to protecting our public lands. My new plan would ensure that places like this stay beautiful for generations to come. 
I‚Äôm grateful to everyone who chipped in before our last FEC deadline. This grassroots movement is by the people, for the people‚Äîand that‚Äôs how we‚Äôll keep fighting for big, structural change. Will you chip in $3, or whatever you can, to help us win in 2020? 
It was an honor to meet you, Dr. Apryl.

We need big, structural change‚Äîlike my new public lands idea‚Äîto tackle climate change and protect our planet before it‚Äôs too late. You can read more about our new idea here:  
Woo-hoo! The crowd in Denver is fired up. I‚Äôm grateful to have all of you in this grassroots movement. See you soon. 
 By popular demand... 
I believe we have a moral obligation to protect our public lands. We owe it to our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come. 
Unions built the middle class, and unions will rebuild the middle class. I stand with the 31K workers who are making their voices heard, and fighting for better wages and working conditions.

Still smiling over the warm welcome I received in Beaufort yesterday. I agree‚Äîit‚Äôs about time we have a woman president. (That kettle corn was amazing, by the way!) 
Climate change is an existential threat. There is no Planet B for us. At our house party in Lebanon, NH this weekend, I talked about how we need to protect our environment‚Äîand my new ideas to protect public lands is a step in that direction. 
My big new idea bans new fossil fuel drilling offshore and on public lands, generates more renewable energy, establishes free entry to all national parks, and more. Sign our petition if you support more protection for public lands.  
I stand with as they make their voices heard this week. 
This list shouldn‚Äôt be this long‚Äîheck, there shouldn't be a list in the first place. Under my Real Corporate Profits Tax, giant corporations like these wouldn‚Äôt be able to get away with paying $0 in income taxes.

I called for an investigation into Bernhardt‚Äôs conflicts of interests as a lobbyist-turned Acting Interior Secretary. The American people shouldn‚Äôt have to wonder if their government is working to protect them from climate change‚Äîor working for big corporations. Time for answers. 
It‚Äôs time to make America‚Äôs public lands part of our climate change solution. That means we need to stop corporations from pillaging our public lands and leaving taxpayers to clean up the mess. My new idea puts our environment and our communities first. 
America‚Äôs public lands belong to all of us. We should start acting like it. That means expanding access, ending fossil fuel extraction, more renewables, and maintaining and improving public lands. Together, we can protect our public lands for generations to come.
Trump is selling off public lands to oil, gas, and coal companies. It's wrong. Let's end it and make our public lands part of the climate solution‚Äîwith a total moratorium on new fossil fuel drilling and a plan to get 10% of America's energy from renewables on these lands instead.
America‚Äôs public lands provide us with clean air and water, sustain fish and wildlife, and offer a place for millions to experience the beauty of nature. Right now, they're under attack. Read my new plan to protect them while fighting climate change:

In response to my plan, Amazon says it "pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the US." Yeah, I know. You made more than $10 billion in profits last year and you were required to pay $0 in federal corporate taxes. That's the problem. 
For decades, our government‚Äôs racist redlining laws blocked Black families from home ownership and building wealth. My new housing idea would level the playing field so everyone can have access to safe and affordable housing. 
This is a campaign about ideas and big, structural change. This is what we‚Äôre fighting for‚Äîand we‚Äôre just getting started. 
Our corporate income tax rules are riddled with loopholes, exemptions, and deductions. Even companies that tell shareholders they have made more than a billion dollars in profits can end up paying no corporate income taxes. I want to tackle that problem head on. 
To ensure every corporation pays their fair share, ‚Ääwe need a new kind of tax that big companies can‚Äôt get around. That‚Äôs what my new tax idea would accomplish. 
Thanks, Chandler. My new idea will fix a lot of loopholes in our corporate tax code. I‚Äôm glad to have support from a fellow Okie. 
You bet I do. 
I guess Rep. Brady is fine with 60 of the biggest corporations in the US paying $0 in taxes on a combined $79 billion in profits‚Äîwhile the rest of us pay federal taxes to fund our military, our roads, and our bridges.I'm not, and my Real Corporate Profits Tax would fix that.
My new idea, the Real Corporate Profits Tax, would fix some huge holes in our corporate tax code. Giant companies like Amazon shouldn‚Äôt be able to get away with paying $0 in federal corporate income taxes. Add your name if you agree.  
So today I‚Äôm proposing a new idea: Tax the *real profits* very large American companies report to their investors‚Äîno loopholes or exemptions‚Äîand let‚Äôs make this year the last year any company with massive profits pays zero federal taxes. 
Big corporations have lobbied relentlessly to fill our corporate tax rules with so many loopholes and exemptions that even when they report a billion dollars in profits to their investors and the public, they can report much lower ‚Äúprofits‚Äù to the IRS‚Äîand pay no taxes on them.
If you've already filed your taxes this year, chances are you paid more than a lot of the big corporations. They made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits this year‚Äîbut many of them won‚Äôt pay a dime towards keeping our country safe and our economy strong.
Wishing a happy  to my three big brothers: Don Reed, David, and John. All three of them answered our country‚Äôs call to serve. I‚Äôm eternally grateful for their service and the service of all our men and women in uniform.

We need to rebuild unions in this country. That's why I‚Äôve proposed a new law banning states from passing so-called right to work laws that destroy labor unions. It will make sure that unions have a front-and-center seat at the table in any trade negotiation.

There‚Äôs a crisis of faith in government‚Äîand that‚Äôs because the American people think the government works for the wealthy and well-connected, not for them. And they‚Äôre right.

Two months ago today, we kicked off this campaign, and I'm fired up by the movement that we've built together. Change like this is gonna be hard. But when we work together, organize together, and persist together, we'll make big structural change. We‚Äôre gonna do this!

The Senate created the filibuster, and if necessary, the Senate can get rid of the filibuster. We don‚Äôt have to let Mitch McConnell‚Äôs cynical hypocrisy win. Add your name if you agree we can‚Äôt let Republican abuse of the filibuster stop the big, structural change we need.

We don‚Äôt get what we don‚Äôt fight for. It was an honor to be at the  with to talk about my new idea: In 2021, if Mitch McConnell puts petty partisanship ahead of our country, then we should get rid of the filibuster.

Voter suppression is real. We have to call it out and fight back‚Äîstarting with a constitutional amendment that establishes a nationally-recognized right to vote and a right to get that vote counted.

 This speech at will someday be seen as historic. She is connecting big time with her personal story‚Ä¶
For generations, the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice. If the Republicans put small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country, then we should get rid of the filibuster. 
The Senate created the filibuster, and if necessary, the Senate can get rid of the filibuster. We don‚Äôt have to let Mitch McConnell‚Äôs cynical hypocrisy win. Add your name if you agree we can‚Äôt let Republican abuse of the filibuster stop the big, structural change we need.

With so much on the line for our country, there‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be than standing shoulder to shoulder with grassroots fighters and the Network. Read my remarks from the  here. 
It was an honor to be at  today. For decades under the leadership of my friend the Network and the people in this room have been on the front lines of the fight for social, racial, and economic justice. 
On a typical presidential campaign, the candidate spends a lot of time listening to wealthy donors and hearing what issues they care about. Not on this campaign. Click here to take the two-minute Warren for President survey and share what matters to you.

In just a few minutes, I‚Äôll be speaking at the Network Convention about the big, structural change we‚Äôre fighting for, and the powerful forces‚Äîincluding the Senate filibuster‚Äîthat will try to hold progress back. Tune in here. 
We‚Äôre done with having two sets of rules. When Democrats have the White House again, if Mitch McConnell continues to put small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing our country, then we should get rid of the filibuster.
I‚Äôve watched Republicans abuse the rules when they‚Äôre out of power, then turn around and blow off the rules when they‚Äôre in power. We just saw it happen again this week when they unilaterally changed the same rules they abused to ram through President Trump's extreme nominees.
For generations the filibuster has been used to block progress, and in recent years, obstruction in the Senate has only gotten worse. We‚Äôre fighting for big, structural change‚Äîbut we won't get anything done unless we face this head on.
Jail time. That‚Äôs what you should get if you negligently oversee a big corporation that defrauds hard working Americans. My ideas tackle corporate fraud head on. 
Amazon used to promote its products above other vendors. Not anymore‚Äîthey‚Äôre scared by my plan to  Now we need to make sure there are rules in place so it doesn‚Äôt happen again. You can be the umpire or you can own a team, but you can‚Äôt do both at the same time. 
Happy birthday, NATO! America is strongest when we work together with our allies.  
51 years ago the life of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was tragically taken away. They may kill the dreamer, but they can never kill the dream. Today and every day, we are the heirs of Dr. King‚Äôs dream ; we are called to continue fighting for social, racial, ; economic justice. 
Under my new proposal, corporate executives who negligently oversee a giant company causing severe harm to American families would face jail time. Sign our petition to become an official citizen co-sponsor. 
Great point, Jamie! How about we start with you giving back the $3.7 billion J.P. Morgan made this year off the  that you lobbied for? 
 Senator couldn‚Äôt be more right. It‚Äôs time we end the corruption in DC and ensure our government works everyone‚Äîn‚Ä¶
At least 25 people in the Trump administration were denied security clearances, yet they insisted on ramming them through approval anyway. The man in the White House is putting our national security at risk. 
If a giant corporation cheats, defrauds, or hurts Americans, the executives in charge should be held responsible ‚Äî including facing jail time. The new law I‚Äôm proposing would do just that. Sign on as a citizen co-sponsor if you‚Äôre with me.
We need a justice system that ensures that if you cheat and steal and defraud and hurt Americans, you could go to jail. Sign on to support my new plan to hold Corporate America accountable and ensure CEOs of big companies that hurt Americans are criminally liable under the law.

I left a voicemail for Dan, a small-dollar donor from New York who just chipped into our campaign. It really matters and I‚Äôm grateful for people like him. 
Great seeing you, 
This grassroots movement starts with the people. I hope you‚Äôll attend or host a  house party in your community on April 13th. Are you in?  
What a historic night for Chicago! Congratulations, Lori Lightfoot. 
After the big banks crashed our economy 10 years ago, guess how many CEOs went to prison for their frauds? Zero. My new idea would hold executives at big companies criminally accountable‚Äîif you negligently oversee scams on the American people, you should go to jail.

People should be able to live without fear or discrimination‚Äîregardless of who they love. 
I‚Äôm proud down to my toes that our team is growing across the country‚Äîand we‚Äôre not even done yet! You can check out our open positions here: 
You know the system is rigged when the IRS targets working Americans while dedicating fewer and fewer resources to holding the ultra-wealthy taxpayers accountable. 
No wealthy donors. No fancy closed door fundraisers. Just people who pitch in what they can to keep growing this grassroots movement. 
Today, I‚Äôm proposing a new law that expands criminal liability to any corporate executive who negligently oversees a company that causes severe and widespread harm to families. Our justice system should ensure that if you cheat working Americans, you‚Äôll go to jail.
But we need to go further. From Equifax to BP, top executives across the country have overseen corporate conduct that has done real harm to American families‚Äîand walked away without any jail time.
Congress should start by enacting the Ending Too Big To Jail Act I introduced last year. This bill would make it easier to hold executives at big banks criminally liable for scams.
It‚Äôs been 10 years since the financial crash cost millions of people their homes, jobs, and savings. But not one big bank CEO has gone to jail. It‚Äôs time to reform our laws to make sure that corporate executives face jail time for overseeing massive scams. 
I‚Äôm grateful that people around the country have joined forces to host  parties on April 13th and beyond. We‚Äôre going to do this together! Are you signed up to attend or host in your community?  
Organizers are an essential part of this campaign. I‚Äôm glad that Juliana is leading our movement in Iowa.

If we want to tackle the opioid epidemic head on, then we have to hold Big Pharma executives accountable. Rep. Elijah Cummings and I have a plan that demands accountability and provides communities with the resources they need to beat this. 
This is a disgrace. Our service-members deserve to be treated with respect. 
The man in the White House is obsessed with holding up the funds to help Puerto Rico recover more than a year after Hurricane Maria. Three million US citizens live on the island and we need to show them some respect. 
For decades, government policy has worked to keep us separate from each other while neglecting nearly every kind of housing‚Äîsuburban, rural, and urban. My housing policy rejects this legacy of segregation and disdain to build better communities for everyone. 
I‚Äôm keeping Ashanti and her loved ones in my prayers. At least 26 trans people were killed in 2018, and most of them were women of color. We need to call that out‚Äîand fight back. 
One way we can fight for  is to guarantee affordable child care and early education for every kid in America. And I've got a plan to do just that.  
Too many families don't have an Aunt Bee, or access to quality child care. And too often, it's women whose careers and paychecks take the hit when they don't have child care.
I was teaching at a law school in Houston when the kids were little and, suddenly, the babysitter quit. I tried all sorts of child care options, but none of them worked out. I thought I'd have to quit my job. But my Aunt Bee flew down to help out, and I kept my job.
The Trump administration rammed through security clearances that had been turned down. The administration is a walking, talking, living, breathing threat to national security, and we just have to call it out. 
We don‚Äôt win if we don‚Äôt fight. I‚Äôm in this fight all the way for big ideas like  and the  that will move our country forward. 
Giant corporations have figured out a way to cut out the competition and take more profits for themselves‚Äîsqueezing the life out of family farms. My new idea would tackle this head on. 
Voter suppression is real‚Äîand we need to put more federal muscle in the fight to end it. That's why we need a constitutional amendment that protects every American citizen's right to vote and to have that vote counted. 
Looking forward to speaking at the  Summit this afternoon. Tune in at 3:30 PM ET!  
No tricks, only treats.  
Housing is already the biggest expense for most families‚Äîand it's just getting worse. Every American deserves a safe, decent, and affordable place to live, and my housing plan will reduce rents by 10%.  
We've got to fight back against consolidation. It's time to reverse the Bayer-Monsanto merger. 
I love getting pictures with everyone who comes out to our organizing events. No matter how long it takes, I‚Äôll be there taking selfies till the end 
Chicago: I hope you‚Äôll cast your vote for my friend, Michael tomorrow! He's a real fighter who works every day to level the playing field for America‚Äôs working families. He‚Äôll be a terrific Alderman for the 47th ward. Polls are open from 6 AM to 7 PM.
In just a few hours, we‚Äôll close the books on our first big FEC fundraising deadline. This is a chance to show the strength of our grassroots movement.

The crisis isn‚Äôt just about a technical issue: It‚Äôs systemic corruption. There‚Äôs a revolving door between industry and regulators‚Äîwhere the people lose and big corporations win. My plan to  would close that door. 
Last year, farmers got less than 15 cents of every dollar that Americans spent on food‚Äîthe lowest amount since the Department of Agriculture began tracking that figure in 1993. My plan to break up agribusinesses like Monsanto would help family farmers get what they deserve. 
I want Washington to work for family farmers, not just for the agribusiness executives pocketing multi-million dollar bonuses. I joined Family Farm Action today to say loud and clear: We need a Farmers Bill of Rights. 
At the Heartland Forum, I talked about how Washington should work for family farmers across America‚Äînot just the agribusiness executives pocketing multi-million dollar bonuses or the Wall Street traders.

Just wrapped up our event in Marshalltown where I answered my 200th town hall question (it was about climate change). I‚Äôll keep fighting to protect the planet for our children and grandchildren. 
I told The Mueller report needs to be made public. That‚Äôs all there is to it. 
The Koch brothers act tough. But they're terrified of anything that challenges the political power of giant companies ; billionaires. That's why they're spending freely against my idea to  But Americans are tired of getting run over‚Äîand we're ready to fight back. 
We're the richest nation in the history of the world. But the wealthy and the well-connected rig the system to benefit themselves. An  on the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans would level the playing field for everyone. 
You shouldn‚Äôt have to be ultra-wealthy in order to afford life-saving drugs. The government should stop tip-toeing around while giant drug companies squeeze the American people. 
Santee Cooper is showering its executives with big bonuses‚Äîwhile ratepayers foot the bill. I‚Äôm glad the South Carolina legislature is tackling this corporate greed head on. 
In Greenville, Mississippi and rural communities across America, home ownership has gotten further and further out of reach. My new proposal would give families everywhere a real shot at the American dream. 
300 pages‚Äîand all we‚Äôve seen is a 5th grade book report from the President's handpicked AG. Attorney General Barr:  now. 
Consolidation is choking family farms. But there‚Äôs a whole lot of other ways in which big business has rigged the rules in their favor and hard working farmers across the country have been left behind. I‚Äôll fight to change those rules. 
Outrageous. Many Americans work full-time, minimum-wage jobs and still live paycheck to paycheck‚Äîwhile the average bonus for a Wall Street banker has gone up 1000% since 1989. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in this fight. 
Trump and the Republicans never wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They've always wanted to burn it down. We need  and we need a government that works for the people, not for giant drug companies. 
By the way, getting fired shouldn't be the end of the story for Tim Sloan. He shouldn't get a golden parachute. He should be investigated by the SEC and the DOJ for his role in all the Wells Fargo scams. And if he's guilty of any crimes, he should be put in jail like anyone else.
BREAKING: We also had iced tea! 
About damn time. Tim Sloan should have been fired a long time ago. He enabled Wells Fargo's massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, ; then helped cover it up. Now‚Äîlet's make sure all the people hurt by Wells Fargo's scams get the relief they're owed. 
I‚Äôll be in Storm Lake, Marshalltown, and West Des Moines this weekend. Will we see you there? RSVP here. 
Last night, I told In this Democratic primary, we need to push our big, bold ideas forward. We can do this together. 
Right now, farmers are caught in a vise‚Äîbut it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. We can make better policy choices‚Ää, and we can begin by leveling the playing field for America‚Äôs family farmers. 
Thank you, Brandon! I‚Äôm glad we got to talk. We‚Äôre building something big‚Äîone small-dollar donation at a time. 
It was really me, Thanks for being a part of our movement. 
Betsy DeVos is the worst education secretary in living memory. We need opportunities for all of our kids‚Äînot just some of them. 
Oh look‚Äîthe Koch brothers don‚Äôt like my ideas. Apparently they're horrified about any effort to try and rein in the economic and political power of giant corporations. I'm shocked. 
Candidates for president don‚Äôt always go to MS, TN, or AL because they aren‚Äôt battleground states. But I‚Äôm running to be president of the entire United States. I‚Äôm planning to travel to every corner of this country‚Äîand I‚Äôve got the best staff who will make it happen!

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too hard‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs what people told abolitionists, suffragettes, early labor organizers, civil rights leaders, and the first LGBTQ rights activists. Yet every one of them stayed in the fight, and persisted. It‚Äôs our moment to change the direction of American history. 
Giant agribusinesses like Monsanto have too much power to squeeze farmers. One of my new ideas to help farmers is to appoint trustbusters to review‚Äîand reverse‚Äîmergers, including the recent Bayer-Monsanto merger that should never have been approved. 
Thanks for picking up my call, I‚Äôm so glad we got to talk!

Today a farmer can work hard, do everything right‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven get great weather‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand still not make it. My new idea would level the playing field for America‚Äôs farmers by standing up to Big Ag and un-rigging the rules that are hurting competition. 
The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. Without it, millions of American families would lose health care coverage. I‚Äôll fight tooth and nail to protect it.

I agree. By getting rid of the electoral college and replacing it with a national popular vote, we can protect our democracy and make sure everyone‚Äôs vote counts.

‚ÄúConversion therapy‚Äù is cruel. I‚Äôm glad to see the government of Puerto Rico taking real steps to end this immoral practice. People should be able to love who they love without fear or discrimination.

Homeownership is out of reach for too many families‚Äîespecially Black families. Decades of discrimination by the federal government denied families of color the same kinds of homeownership subsidies available to white families. We need to tackle this head on. 
Add your name as a citizen co-sponsor of my American Housing and Economic Mobility Act. Let‚Äôs work together to ensure every American has a safe, decent, and affordable place to live. 
Let's be clear: We‚Äôre not going to solve our housing crisis by nibbling at the edges. We need to tackle it head on‚Äîwith big, comprehensive solutions that match the size of the problems we have. That‚Äôs what my housing plan for America does.
Government regulators looked the other way before the 2008 crisis as predatory financial institutions targeted minority communities and sucked billions of dollars in wealth out of them.
The gap between white homeownership rates and Black homeownership rates is 30%‚Äîmore than it was when housing discrimination was legal in 1960.
Government at all levels hasn‚Äôt done enough to tackle our housing problems. The federal government has reduced investments in housing for middle-class and lower-income families even as rents have gone up.
I still think about these gut-wrenching stories because it‚Äôs a powerful reminder of what housing means in our country. That's why it's so important for government to get housing policy right.
During the 2008 housing crisis, I traveled to NV to hear the stories of those who'd lost their homes. I was part of the panel that oversaw how the Treasury Department was spending the bank bailout money, and I wanted to make sure we heard from the people being hit the hardest.
Housing is one of the biggest purchases most Americans will make in their lifetimes. My new Housing plan would address some of the most pressing issues that have kept homeownership out of reach for too many families. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to do it: 
 we mourn with you, the Muslim community, and all New Zealanders. We join you in standing up to hatred and extremism at home and around the world‚Äîtoday and every day. 
Charleston, Pittsburgh, and now Christchurch. Everyone should have the right to worship without fear, and an attack on a place of worship is terrorism perpetrated against all of us. My heart goes out to the people of New Zealand today.

If you want proof that Facebook has too much power, look no further than their ability to shut down a debate over whether their platform has too much power.

This policy to ban transgender people from openly serving in our military is shameful and should be reversed immediately. We‚Äôre going to fight this tooth-and-nail. 
Today on I talked with and about my new plan to  They asked me if I thought Google, Amazon, and Facebook are all monopolies. Here‚Äôs my answer. 
About time. Now it's Congress's job to figure out what went wrong here, and why this decision took so long, to make sure it doesn't happen again. Nothing should come before the safety and security of the American people‚Äîespecially not corporate profits or political favors. 
Paul Manafort just got 43 more months for a new raft of crimes. Black men like Bernard Noble can get decades just for selling 2 joints. We need criminal justice reform so the well-connected play by the same rules as everyone else. Now.

A president who actually cares about the American people's safety does not decide whether to ground an airplane based on Boeing's profits, Boeing's political donations, the rich CEO's visit to Mar-a-Lago, or personal phone calls. The FAA needs to get this plane out of the sky.

The Boeing 737 MAX 8 is a major driver of profits. In the coming weeks and months, Congress must hold hearings on whether an administration that famously refused to stand up to Saudi Arabia to protect arms sales has once again put lives at risk for the same reason.
The FAA itself has indicated that software updates are likely coming. Any necessary changes must be made before, not after, more flights occur and more lives are potentially endangered.
Dozens of these planes fly daily in the US. The UK, China, Australia and several other countries have already grounded the 737 MAX. The  should follow their lead, reverse their decision, and immediately ground this plane in the US until its safety can be assured.
We witnessed the second tragic crash of 737 MAX 8 planes in less than 6 months. We don‚Äôt know the cause of these crashes‚Äîbut serious questions have been raised about whether these planes were pressed into service without additional pilot training.
When women fight, women win.  
We want big, structural change. And we‚Äôre going to do it together. 
Citizens United opened the floodgates of foreign money into US politics. This decision is a victory for our democracy. 
We want to rein in the companies that think they get to roll over everyone‚Äîand that doesn‚Äôt start by talking to folks in Washington. It starts in rooms like this one. 
You shouldn't have to contact Facebook's publicists in order for them to decide to "allow robust debate" about Facebook. They shouldn‚Äôt have that much power. 
Curious why I think FB has too much power? Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor.

This policy will ensure that tech entrepreneurs have a fighting chance to compete against the big companies. That‚Äôs how we get innovation.
Let's be clear: This policy won't limit your ability to go on Amazon and find 30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days. And you‚Äôll still be able to go on Facebook and see how your old friend from school is doing.

Donald Trump shouldn‚Äôt use his power to shield his friends from justice. And the next President shouldn‚Äôt protect them, either. Or him. 
Let me be perfectly clear: If I‚Äôm elected President, there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in the investigations around Donald Trump. Everyone who might succeed him as president should adopt the same policy, starting with Vice President Pence. Add your name if you agree.

The pardon and clemency powers are supposed to be about granting mercy to the powerless, not immunity for the powerful. The next President should promise: No pardons or commutations for any person implicated as part of a federal criminal investigation related to Donald Trump.
But here‚Äôs the biggest threat right now: Donald Trump, or the next President, using the pardon power to cover up and permanently excuse this wrongdoing.
Our criminal justice system is hanging on and doing its job ‚Äì the truth is coming out ‚Äì despite unprecedented, relentless, and potentially illegal pressure from Donald Trump and his associates in and out of government.
Donald Trump and his associates are trying to sabotage our criminal justice system. Read my full break-down here: 
34 individuals and 3 companies have been indicted, convicted, or pled guilty. And now Michael Cohen ‚Äì who‚Äôs been involved in everything he‚Äôs done for decades including his time in the White House ‚Äì has confessed to breaking the law on Trump‚Äôs behalf.
Michael Cohen, one of Donald Trump‚Äôs most trusted advisors, just implicated him in criminal activity while he‚Äôs been in the White House. It‚Äôs the most descriptive account of illegal acts committed by Donald Trump and the people working for him.

Make a donation ‚Äì of any amount ‚Äì and know that no matter what you‚Äôre able to contribute, you‚Äôll be on equal footing with every single other donor to this campaign. 
But I believe the biggest risk in this election is failing to empower the millions of people who feel the squeeze of an economy rigged against them and the deep frustration of a failing political system that produced Donald Trump in the first place. So let‚Äôs change it.
There are some Democrats who are so deeply afraid of losing to Donald Trump that they don‚Äôt want to risk saying or doing anything different at all. Even if they agree that we need big, structural change, they see challenging the status quo as an electoral risk.
If we build our campaign person to person, town to town, all across this country, it means we‚Äôll win up and down the ballot in 2020. And we‚Äôll have the power to make big, structural changes in 2021. 
On our campaign, there‚Äôll be no event you‚Äôll be excluded from because you can‚Äôt afford it, and no better seats or 1:1 time with me at events if you can. What you donate shouldn‚Äôt determine the amount of time you get to spend with a candidate. My plan: 
It‚Äôs been estimated that up to 70% of a congressional candidate‚Äôs time is spent with potential wealthy donors. It‚Äôs safe to assume that goes for presidential campaigns too, and presidential donors are disproportionately white, male, and wealthy. We have to do things differently.
Let‚Äôs call out something that usually goes unspoken: Presidential candidates spend way too much time with wealthy donors. For every time you see a presidential candidate talking with voters, they‚Äôre spending three or four times as long with wealthy donors behind closed doors.
I‚Äôve already said that I'll run my campaign differently ‚Äì no Washington lobbyist money, no dark money, no super PACs. But today, I‚Äôm going further. My presidential primary campaign will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it.

There are so many common-sense gun reforms that Americans support. Just a few: ‚úîÔ∏èBan assault weapons ; bump-stocks‚úîÔ∏èEnd the gun show loophole‚úîÔ∏èPrevent domestic abusers from legally obtaining gunsBut 1 yr later, Congress hasn‚Äôt lifted a finger bc of plain, rancid corruption.
A year ago today, someone intent on doing harm was able to murder 17 students and teachers in Parkland because they had a military-grade gun. We grieve with victims‚Äô families. And we fight alongside the Parkland students to fix our laws. 
Cedar Rapids ‚Äì all I can say is, wow! This grassroots movement is about all of us fighting together, and after last weekend I know we‚Äôre off to a great start. 
I put the past 10 years of my federal tax returns online. And now I‚Äôm calling on every other candidate for President to do exactly the same thing. Add your name to our petition calling on all 2020 presidential candidates to put their taxes online. 
Two years ago, I voted against Under his watch, our country‚Äôs response to  was a total failure. Then he used taxpayer money at to pay for personal travel. It was corruption, plain and simple. I'm glad he's resigning
 fight is our fight. Every day, teachers open up new possibilities for their students. They deserve fair pay.  
My  bill is less than a page long. I believe it‚Äôs pretty simple: No President ‚Äì Republican or Democrat ‚Äì should start a nuclear war. 
Roger is a person of deep integrity, someone who always tells the truth and who never makes a promise that he doesn‚Äôt keep. I'm grateful and honored to have him in this fight. 
It‚Äôs not equal justice when a kid with an ounce of pot can get thrown in jail, while a bank executive who launders money for a drug cartel can get a bonus. We need reform. 
Teachers spend years and years working hard and studying so they can do something good in the world. Obviously, this guy wouldn't know anything about that. 
This stinks like a pile of old fish. Under my bill to  a former lobbyist like David Bernhardt wouldn't be allowed to run the and pad the pockets of his former clients. 
Running for President: that's what girls do. 
This is what a first day on a presidential campaign looks like (in 30 seconds). 
On Saturday in Lawrence, we came together ‚Äì ready to raise our voices together until this fight is won. This is our moment in history, the moment we are called to.  
 If you must travel during  this afternoon, clear snow off your vehicle, maintain a safe distance, take it slow, give yo‚Ä¶
Unions built the middle class, and unions will rebuild the middle class. I had a great discussion with about how we can level the playing field for workers in Davenport, Iowa and across the country. 
Corruption is a cancer on our democracy. And we will only get rid of it with strong medicine ‚Äì with real, structural reform.  
They should be afraid. I want an economy that works for everyone, not just Wall Street bankers and their rich friends. And I believe top executives should go to jail when they break the law, just like anyone else. 
The path to economic security is steep and rocky for millions of working people, and it is steeper and rockier for black and brown Americans. We won't be a party to perpetuating discrimination for another generation. This has to be called out. We need structural change.  
I‚Äôm with all the way. I stand in solidarity with the teachers who are fighting to get the pay they deserve. 
These guys make my heart happy. 
Everyone should have a shot at the American dream ‚Äì and that means fighting for a   an  and a whole lot more. Read my speech from Saturday if you haven‚Äôt already. 
Thank you to everyone who joined us in Dover, NH on Saturday! We had a great conversation about how we can level the playing field for working people. 
Facts! 
Joycelyn Elders served as our country‚Äôs first African American Surgeon General. She grew up attending a segregated school, before joining the Army ; earning her MD. She is a groundbreaking advocate for women‚Äôs health ; access to health care.  
I just took a big step ‚Äì I‚Äôm running for President. I‚Äôm deeply inspired by the energy of our grassroots movement and I‚Äôm ready for this fight. You can watch my entire speech here. 
More than 300 people in Davenport, Iowa were willing to miss the first part of the  to talk about raising wages and strengthening unions. I love Iowa. 
Watch out, this one moves fast. SECOND selfie line of the day. Thank you, Iowa City! 
I was glad to meet so many energized people in Iowa City today. They were ready to dream big, fight hard, and win. And that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre gonna do. 
 Just reading some tweets in the car. 
Thanks to the hundreds who braved the snow in Cedar Rapids, Iowa this morning!  
First full day as a presidential candidate ‚Äì first selfie line as one. Thank you, Cedar Rapids! 
Yesterday I made a big announcement: I‚Äôm running for President. Our fight is for big, structural change ‚Äì and this is the fight of our lives. I hope you'll join us. 
Billionaire CEOs can‚Äôt shut us up. Donald Trump can‚Äôt shut us up. The GOP can‚Äôt shut us up. Here‚Äôs what I say to them: We‚Äôre just getting started. We‚Äôre building a grassroots movement to level the playing field. Sign up ; be a part of this. 
Melnea Cass, the ‚ÄúFirst Lady of Roxbury," was a beloved leader of MA's civil rights fight ‚Äì registering voters, protesting racist hiring practices, fighting education inequality, ; leading the  
I‚Äôm deeply grateful for everyone who made our announcement in Lawrence so incredible. This grassroots movement will put power back in the hands of the people ‚Äì where it belongs. 
We had a terrific crowd of people in Dover, NH who are ready to get organized, build a movement, and make big, structural change. 
This campaign is fueled by small donors and people ready to roll up their sleeves and get in this fight. Lauren is one of those people, and I got to surprise her in Dover today. 
We fight side by side, and that‚Äôs how we‚Äôll make big, structural change. Here‚Äôs my full speech from today in Lawrence:  
Thank you, Lawrence ‚Äì and thank you all for being a part of this special day! Let's dream big, fight hard, and get to work to build a future for all of our kids.  
We're building a grassroots movement to give the power back to the people. We're dreaming big, fighting hard ‚Äì and we're just getting started.  
I believe in an America of opportunity. My daddy ended up as a janitor, but his little girl got the chance to be a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator ‚Äì and a candidate for President of the United States.  
People said it would be ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù to build the and stop big banks from cheating Americans. They said it would be ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù for a woman Senator to be elected in MA. They were wrong.  
Real, fundamental change in America will be hard. There are a lot of people out there with money and power who will try to stop us. Here‚Äôs what I say to them: 
We come from different backgrounds. Different religions. Different languages. Different experiences. We have different dreams. Today, we come together‚Äî ready to raise our voices together until this fight is won. We‚Äôre all in the fight to build an America that works for everyone. 
More than 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. went to Montgomery and warned us about the danger of division. That playbook has been around forever. The rich and powerful use fear to divide us. We‚Äôre done with that. Bigotry has no place in the Oval Office.
I believe real democracy requires equal justice under law. It‚Äôs not equal justice when African Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, more likely to be charged, more likely to be convicted, and more likely to be sentenced.No more.
Let‚Äôs be clear: I won't take a dime of PAC money in this campaign. I won't take a single check from a federal lobbyist, or billionaires who want to run a Super PAC on my behalf.  And I challenge every other candidate who asks for your vote in this primary to do the same.
Our fight is to change the rules so that our government works for everyone. That means: ‚úîÔ∏èA  housing‚úîÔ∏è childcare‚úîÔ∏èStudent loan relief‚úîÔ∏èOverturning Citizens United
 if you agree: We need real tax reform in this country.My  would make the richest tippy-top 0.1% of Americans start doing their part for the country that helped make them rich.
Time to change the rules to put more economic power in the hands of the American people ‚Äì workers and small businesses. We need to put power back in the hands of workers, and take on Wall Street so that the big banks can never again threaten the security of our economy. 
We need to  in Washington. Let‚Äôs ‚úÖClose the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington‚úÖEnd lobbying as we know it‚úÖBan foreign governments from hiring lobbyists in Washington‚úÖFix the Swiss cheese definition of ‚Äúlobbyist"
America‚Äôs middle class has been deliberately hollowed out. The richest, most powerful people in America lobbied Washington and paid off politicians to tilt the system. And year by year, bit by bit, more of the wealth and opportunity went to the people at the very top.
I grew up in Oklahoma, on the ragged edge of the middle class. When my daddy had a heart attack, my family nearly tumbled over the financial cliff. But we didn‚Äôt. My mother‚Äôs minimum-wage job answering phones at Sears saved our house, and saved our family.
This is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way.And that is why I‚Äôm in Lawrence, MA today: to declare that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America.
"This country needs a leader who will restore the solidarity that Donald Trump stole. Who won‚Äôt cower from the big, tough battles, from the ugly injustice and oppression that still finds its way to American soil." ‚ÄìRep.  
"Before there was an editorial every day lamenting economic inequity, Elizabeth Warren knew that stock prices don‚Äôt tell a full account of our country‚Äôs economic story. Medical bankruptcies and foreclosures and paychecks are part of that story, too." ‚ÄìRep.  
"I am so thrilled to help introduce the next President of the United States ‚Äì Elizabeth Warren!" ‚ÄìRep. 
Here we go. Tune in!  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in Congress for a while now, and no one knows how to fight for what is right better than Elizabeth Warren. We will always have her back, because she will always have our back when she is in the White House." ‚ÄìSenator  
"Elizabeth Warren knows that dreams are worth fighting for. And that is exactly what I‚Äôve seen her do in the US Senate. For six years, she has been fighting in the trenches for what is right for the people of MA and the entire country." ‚ÄìSenator  
‚ÄúWe could count on a President Warren to wake up each and every day and put the needs of the American people at the forefront of our policy debates and enact real, enduring, and significant change.‚Äù ‚ÄìRep.  
‚ÄúIt is clear to me that we need to fundamentally reorient our economy around helping hardworking families, like the one I grew up in, get ahead. To do this we need a champion in the White House ‚Äì a champion like Elizabeth Warren.‚Äù ‚ÄìRep.  
"We‚Äôve seen Elizabeth Warren bring bold ideas that ignite the grassroots before. We‚Äôve seen her win and then turn the platform into a foundation for changing the system together." ‚ÄìBoston City Councilor  
‚ÄúWe want bold ideas to fix the deep problems facing our generation. And we‚Äôre ready to fight for it. When you look for bold leadership for America, you don‚Äôt need to look further than Massachusetts for our Senator.‚Äù ‚ÄìBoston City Councilor

‚ÄúElizabeth will fight to tip the scales back into the working families favor. She sees immigrants for what we are: the backbone of America.‚Äù ‚ÄìLawrence Mayor 
"Here‚Äôs the truth: to make that dream a reality, we need a friend ; partner in the White House. And that‚Äôs Elizabeth Warren." ‚ÄìLawrence Mayor 
‚ÄúWe are so excited to be here this morning to fight for someone who has and will continue to fight for all of us: Senator Elizabeth Warren.‚Äù ‚ÄìLawrence Mayor
