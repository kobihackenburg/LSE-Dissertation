Here's how we can empower American workers:‚úÖ A $15 minimum wage‚úÖ Strengthen collective bargaining‚úÖ Equal pay‚úÖ Repeal the Trump tax cutsAn economy that leaves no one behind is good for everyone. 
We know this:The stronger the coalition, the greater the victory.The more inclusive the coalition, the greater the victory.If you want to bring a fight, you bring people together. 
I‚Äôve often said that as your president, I'll ask more from you than any president has ever asked from you in your life‚Äîbut before we can get there, I need to ask more of you now to get us to the White House. Please get involved with our campaign: 
The level of income inequality in this country is staggering‚Äîbut we have the power to do something about it. My plan restructures our tax system by closing loopholes that allow the wealthiest households to avoid paying their fair share. Learn more:

The Trump tax cuts provided a big giveaway to the wealthiest families and largest corporations. Instead, we should be putting cash back in the pockets of working families. 
Ban private prisons.Legalize marijuana.End the War on Drugs.We have a lot of work to do to reform a criminal justice system that's so deeply broken‚Äîbut we can start there.
If you‚Äôre interested in volunteering with our campaign‚Äîeverything from calling voters from home to knocking doors in Iowa‚Äîplease join our team! We need all hands on deck as we head into the critical early-state caucuses starting in less than a month: 
The highlight of my trip to Iowa this week: Receiving framed portraits of my great grandparents from my cousins. Deeply moved by and grateful for this gift‚Äîone that I‚Äôll bring with me to the White House.  
There‚Äôs so much pain in this country ; we can end it. We need to fix health care, close the wealth gap, invest in education ; so much more‚Äîbut to do it, we need to revive our sense of common purpose ; empathy for each other. We are interdependent ; need to see each other again. 
 tough, but fair
Raise your hand if you know why people are trolling Elizabeth's dance moves and not my dad jokes 
We can't wait any longer to take bold action on climate change. Now is the time to begin the transition to a 100% carbon-neutral economy, accelerate the end of fossil fuels, and make sweeping investments toward environmental justice. 
Just stepped out of a 75-minute briefing regarding President Trump‚Äôs military actions in Iraq‚Äîwe were provided no evidence of an imminent threat. I remain deeply skeptical that he had justification for this attack.
In our elections, I believe the person with the most votes should be declared the winner. Period. Our current system of electing a president is not democratic. Let's abolish the electoral college once and for all.
Praying for the safety of our troops and personnel in Iraq right now. 
A disturbing trend in this country is the way we criminalize poverty. It's wrong that we hold people in jail pre-trial simply because they can't afford to get out. We need to end the practice of cash bail.
In this country, access to a high-quality education too often depends on the zip code a child lives in and the size of their family‚Äôs bank account. I'm running for president to change that. Every child in America deserves a great public education. 
My thoughts are with the people of Puerto Rico as they face yet another disaster. We must be ready to help our fellow Americans who have endured so much in recent years. 
Proud to stand in solidarity with our Jewish brothers ; sisters to honor AJC's  day. In the face of rising anti-Semitism here and around the world, it‚Äôs on all of us to support the Jewish community ; fight hate in all its forms. 
We must end the expansion of presidential war powers that is undermining our constitutional checks and balances. 
If it wasn't for mass voter suppression, would be the governor of Georgia right now. Protecting the right to vote is one of the most important challenges of our time. We need a modern-day Voting Rights Act.

In America, our spirit is being tested by those who want to tear us apart. We have a choice to make: break into factions or rise in common purpose. Join our campaign, and we will rise together:  
Our public school teachers deserve so much more than just our praise‚Äîthey are some of our country's most influential patriots. Thank you for everything you do. 
I‚Äôm running for president because we only have one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and the only way we beat him is the way we‚Äôve beaten bullies in the past: uniting in common cause, and through collective action. 
Secretary Pompeo, this is as serious as it gets. American lives are in danger‚Äîthat‚Äôs not "a little noise."

This report is disturbing. As a nation, we must move to a 100% carbon-neutral economy as quickly as possible‚Äîand I‚Äôve outlined how we can get this done:

Yes, the challenge before us this year is to beat Trump, but it‚Äôs more than that‚Äîto unite our country. Grateful for my friend ; the Granite Staters who joined us in Nashua today to show us that unity will always be our strength. 
We have a president who has no strategic plan when it comes to Iran and has only made that region less stable and less safe. More thoughts: 
Nearly one year ago, we made our campaign's very first trip to Iowa. Since then, I've stood in countless rooms just like this one, hearing people share what matters most to their communities.32 more days until the Caucuses.32 more days to leave it all on the field. 
Many Americans will need long-term care at some point in their lives‚Äîand many will be caregivers themselves. The need for care is only growing. We must take steps to expand access to quality, affordable long-term care, and I have a plan to do that: 
We need to get big money out of our politics. It's why I refuse to accept a dime in donations from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. We must overturn Citizens United, which has become one of the most disastrous Supreme Court decisions of our time.
I‚Äôm going to miss seeing my friend on the trail. Thank you, Juli√°n, for bringing your ideas and leadership to this race‚Äîyour voice and campaign were invaluable in sticking up for underrepresented communities and pushing the field forward. 
We must expand access to quality, affordable long-term care in this country. It's disturbing how tens of thousands of Iowans currently in LTC facilities ; their caregivers are being hurt by this broken system. Here's how we fix it:

No one in America should die because they can't afford the medication they need to live. As president, I‚Äôll take on the big drug companies that profit off of people's pain. My proposal would hold drug companies accountable and lower drug prices so they are affordable for all.

Here are the things we can do if we raise $800,000 before the end of the year:‚úÖ Keep our TV ads on the air in Iowa‚úÖ Fund more ads in the other early states‚úÖ Hire more staff and scale up in additional statesDonate now to help us hit our big goal: 
We need to get to a place in this country where abortion, contraception, and reproductive freedom are not looked at as conditional care, but a health right for all. 
I'm not a billionaire, so my campaign can't afford to blanket the airwaves with campaign ads‚Äîbut I'm so grateful for our grassroots donors who have stepped up to help us raise enough to start running TV ads in Iowa. Help us keep spreading our message: 
We can't have ‚Äúlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness‚Äù if we don‚Äôt have health care for everyone. If every woman doesn‚Äôt have the freedom to control her own body. If so many work full-time jobs but still live below the poverty line. We must live up to our nation's ideals.
With the rising cost of living in our country, we must do more to help working Americans pay their bills and take care of their loved ones. My Rise Credit would give up to $4,000 per year to a single-income home and $8,000 per year to a married couple. 
The last early state poll was conducted before the November debate. This race has changed a lot since then and there should be more early state polls if that's required to get in the debates. We're investing in grassroots campaigning because that's the best way to reach people. 
Our strategy has always been to invest in our ground game early on and then get hot at the end. With the Iowa caucuses fast approaching, that means it's time to get hot. Chip in now before our end-of-year deadline so we have the resources we need.¬†
I‚Äôve spent my career bringing people together to take on the biggest challenges in our country‚Äîchallenges that too often leave people and entire communities behind‚Äîand I‚Äôll continue doing that as our party‚Äôs nominee. 
We need a Democratic nominee who will help Americans recognize our common pain, ignite our spirit of common purpose ; mobilize a coalition big enough to defeat Donald Trump‚Äîand I believe I can do it. Please watch ; share our campaign‚Äôs newest TV ad, which tells that story.

Social mobility is one of the things that makes America great, a land of dreamers. Every kid should have a fair shot at that opportunity.
We need to take steps to fix our long-term care system so that families don‚Äôt go broke taking care of their loved ones. I have a plan to address this: 
Public education is the best investment in our children's future. My plan would:üçéGive public school teachers a well-deserved raise.üìñDramatically increase funding for low-income schools.‚úèÔ∏èEnsure every child can attend a quality preschool. 
Abortion rights shouldn‚Äôt matter to men because women are our mothers, sisters, daughters, friends. They should matter to men‚Äîto everyone‚Äîbecause women are people.
If we can't take care of our veterans when they come home, then we shouldn't be sending them off to war in the first place. I will fight against privatizing the VA and work to ensure world-class health care for every American who served our country in the armed forces.
 My heart is hurting for the victims of the Alpine Motel Apartments fire. Please keep the families of all those impacted‚Ä¶
The fact that no Black woman has ever been elected governor shows that our democracy still has a long way to go to elect the right leaders who truly represent the people they govern. We need to protect and expand voting rights for ALL Americans. 
Americans are finding that they have more month at the end of their money than money at the end of their month. My Rise Credit would benefit nearly half of all Americans by putting cash into their pockets to help with the rising cost of living.

We need to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Anything less is an injustice.
No one should have to impoverish themselves or quit their job in order to get the care they need or secure care for a loved one. I have a plan to fix our long-term care system: 
It's shameful how our criminal justice system treats the most vulnerable in our society, poor people and people of color. We have so much more work to do to reform this tragically broken system.

We don't always have to agree, but we must be there for each other. We must empower each other. We must find common ground and build bridges across our differences to pursue the common good. 
We must drive investment and economic opportunity in rural communities that have been left out and left behind by the Trump Administration. Every region of America‚Äînot just a few cities along our coasts‚Äîshould share in our country's prosperity.

Before you speak to me about your religion, first show it to me in how you treat other people. Thank you to the faith leaders and others in South Carolina who took the time to meet with me this morning at the 7th Episcopal District AME Fall Convocation who live up to this truth. 
All eligible DACA recipients should renew their DACA as soon as possible. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear a critical case challenging President Trump's termination of DACA‚Äîso, please don‚Äôt wait.  
3 years ago today, Trump won the presidency by just 77,000 votes. In 360 days when we head to the polls, we can‚Äôt forget that‚Äîif we turn out to vote, we will make Trump a one term president.
 Yes and more than 3. There‚Äôs a lot more in there too! Thanks to ‚Äî someone I obviously look up to a lot ‚Äî for havin‚Ä¶

In one week, we‚Äôre hosting an awesome  happy hour at in NYC. I love going to these‚Äîit‚Äôs going to be a lot of fun and a great way to learn more about our campaign. Please join us ; invite your friends! RSVP here: 
I'm horrified by this violence and heartbroken for Mahud Villalaz‚Äîan American citizen who was attacked with acid for being Latino.Hate crimes are on the rise in this country‚Äîand Trump's racist and bigoted rhetoric is responsible. The words and actions of our leaders matter. 
We can live in a country where Americans growing up in rural areas don‚Äôt have to move to find good work. Where small businesses can compete ; grow without being trampled by big corporations. Where every community is empowered ; thriving.That's our fight: 
Finally, my administration will invest in entrepreneurship ; small businesses‚Äîempowering Americans to start enterprises that would drive more innovation, jobs ; growth.
We'll end unchecked corporate concentration that is holding back new and small businesses and the economies of entire communities. We‚Äôll spur competition by strengthening enforcement ; promoting competition to create more opportunity for all.
My plan would also reverse decades of wealth extraction ; exploitation in Black ; Brown communities‚Äîwe‚Äôd do this by creating a Community Justice Fund focused on restoring wealth in historically marginalized communities.
As president, I will launch the City 2030 Project‚Äîa first-of-its-kind national competition that would invest in at least 50 small- and medium-sized cities as vibrant regional economic hubs, bringing jobs ; opportunity to local residents and surrounding communities.
I‚Äôll fight to ensure that Black ; Brown communities, rural areas ; small cities are able to take part in our nation‚Äôs economic growth.
My plan begins with a simple principle: No one and no community in America should be left on the sidelines of our economy. Because wealth ; economic growth shouldn‚Äôt be limited to a few big cities on the coasts.
As president, I will bring this same determination and vision to communities around the country that now face similar problems‚Äîdecades of lost wealth, disinvestment ; an uneven playing field that hurts local businesses.
As Newark's mayor during the Great Recession, I saw my city in crisis ; businesses closing. But we acted, and Newark entered its largest period of economic growth in 50+ years, building new affordable housing, and the first hotel, new office towers, ; new supermarkets in decades.
Today I‚Äôm announcing an economic agenda I will fight for as president, which ensures every community‚Äîfrom cities to rural areas and everywhere in between‚Äîis a place where real economic opportunity can be found. 
Thanks so much for having me on last night, 
We just saw in tonight's elections‚Äîfrom Virginia to Kentucky‚ÄîAmericans are rejecting Trump's divisive brand of politics. We need moral leadership that seeks to unite this country and work for a better future for all Americans.

In 2016, we lost Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes, and African American voter turnout in Wisconsin dropped almost 20% from 2012. We have one shot to make Trump a one-term president‚Äîwe need a candidate who can energize our base and I know I‚Äôm the best person to do it. 
 This week: and stop by! 
As president, I won‚Äôt wait for Congress to act on climate change‚ÄîI‚Äôll quickly:‚úÖ Reinstate ; strengthen CAFE standards‚úÖ Bar new onshore ; offshore fossil fuel leases‚úÖ Rejoin Paris Agreement‚úÖ Revoke Keystone ; Dakota Access Pipeline permits 
More cruelty and bigotry from the Trump Administration. When I am president, it ends. 
In one year, Americans will vote in the most consequential election of our lifetime. We must make Trump a one-term president‚Äîbut we know defeating Trump is the floor, not the ceiling. We need moral leadership back in the White House ; Congress to fight for justice ; equality.
On this day in 1992, Carol Moseley Braun was elected as our country‚Äôs first Black woman senator. Grateful for her incredible service to Illinois and our country, and helping pave the way for our nation's future leaders. 
At last night‚Äôs  I shared the story of my mentor, Frank, a man who taught me the importance of really seeing and hearing people.In case you missed it, watch here to see how when we come together and unite together, we rise together. 
Just stepped off the stage at  you share my values and vision for our country, please chip in to help us continue building a winning campaign: 
Iowa, I see you. I love you. Together, we will rise! 
I‚Äôm running for president to unify our whole party. We need all Democrats across this country to stand together, to work together, to rise together. 
They were words of empowerment ; encouragement ; engagement: you are not alone in this. I am here for you, and together we will figure this out. There are people who say we can‚Äôt win this election by making it about our values, but I reject that‚Äîit's the only way we‚Äôve ever won.
The last time I saw Frank was in hospice. He could barely speak, but he got out the words, ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù I told him I loved him. And before I left, he said to me, ‚ÄúI love you, too.‚Äù Those were the last two things he said to me‚ÄîI see you, I love you. 
As Frank got older, he lost his sight. But every time I would announce myself to him, he would greet me the same way, ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù 
Frank Hutchins was one of my mentors. He was a tenants' rights advocate in Newark. He taught me just how important it is to make people feel seen and heard and understood. 
About to walk on stage at the  Celebration in Iowa to share my vision for our country‚Äîone where we find common ground and unite around a common purpose to achieve big things for all Americans. Watch live: 
Together, we will rise!  
I applaud Oklahoma for this historic vote that will allow hundreds of people who are in jail for low-level drug offenses to return home to their families. The War on Drugs has been a war on people, ruining lives ; not making us safer.

Better idea: Reverse the Trump Tax Cuts and treat capital gains like regular income. That‚Äôll actually raise revenue. Cherry on top is that it doesn‚Äôt target kids who should be paid for their hard work and contributions to a multi-billion dollar industry.

This news out of Missouri is deeply disturbing. The decision to have an abortion should be between a woman and her health care provider, free from government interference. This abuse of power by Missouri Republicans is dystopian. 
This is a good start. 
Fixing our broken criminal justice system has been a life calling to me. As president, I will tear down our morally corrosive and shameful system of mass incarceration. 
Our children are our nation's most precious resource‚Äîthey deserve the very best public schools and local services. Big corporations should pay their fair share of property taxes to support them. California‚Äîplease go to  to support this important initiative.

It's time we end our failed War on Drugs, which has really been a war on people. As president, I will fight to tear down this system, and on Day One begin extending clemency to thousands of individuals serving excessive sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.
Any conversation about legalizing marijuana must also include expunging records and restoring justice to individuals and communities that have been devastated by the failed drug war.
On October 31st, we'll be closing the books on our fundraising for the month. Our campaign has been scaling up these past few weeks‚Äîand we can‚Äôt slow down now. Can you chip in $5 to help us hit our end-of-the-month goal so we can keep up the momentum?

Among high-income nations, the US is the most dangerous country for women when it comes to gun violence. We must close the Boyfriend Loophole‚Äîone of the many reforms I'm fighting for and will get done as president. Enough. 
We need to change the college sports industry from one that exploits the hard work of college athletes to one that empowers them in athletics and in life‚Äîand that includes helping them graduate. 
This is bigger than any one of us. This is bigger than what we say here today. This is about redeeming and repairing, and finally building a justice system that treats all people equally under the law.
We‚Äôre not going to fix this system with lofty promises made during a campaign or a carefully thought out tab on a campaign website‚Äîthis work is hard. Every single person who gets on this stage today needs to be able to explain why they can be trusted to do this work.
There are more Black men under correctional supervision than were enslaved in 1850. We still treat addiction and mental illness by locking people up instead of giving them access to health care.That‚Äôs why this election is so important‚Äîthat‚Äôs what we should be talking about.
Donald Trump was given a platform unchecked for close to an hour. The Bipartisan Justice Center allowed him to create some illusion of support from this community when, in fact, he excluded it.

 "In my community, folks do not have time to sacrifice progress on the altar of purity." ‚ÄîCory at
 Let‚Äôs not make any mistake: It is precisely that diverse coalition of Democrats who will ultimately decide which Democrat will win this primary and go up against Donald Trump next year, and it is precisely that coalition we will need to beat Trump next year.
 ‚ÄúI hear a lot of Democrats talking about winning the Midwest. And yes, I believe we as a party have to reach out to those voters who took a chance on Trump in 2016. But we also win back the Midwest by turning out Black voters ... who didn‚Äôt vote at all.‚Äù‚ÄîCory at

 In a party and a country that is only becoming more diverse, the ability to build multi-racial, multi-ethnic coalitions is not a nice-to-have‚Äîit‚Äôs a job requirement.
 We need to keep the long-view in mind: not just winning a primary, but beating Trump.
 We are the party of the rights of the people‚Äîof equal rights, of civil rights, of workers' rights, of women's rights. We are the people of abortion access, the right to quality healthcare. We are the party of inclusion, about elevating all‚Äîno matter your background.

This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office. It's a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other.  
Attacks on reproductive health care are an assault on one of our most fundamental ideals, that humans should be able to control their own bodies. This is a national crisis‚Äîwe must codify Roe.  
We have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way big tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy. The practices that were abused in 2016 still haven‚Äôt been addressed. 
Ending gun violence is not about leadership‚Äîthe American people are already there. 77 percent of Americans agree that we need gun licensing. For millions, this is a daily nightmare, where we‚Äôre surrendering our freedom to fear. This is the bare minimum.  
This president is turning American moral leadership into a dumpster fire. 
Donald Trump, time and time again, is showing moral weakness‚ÄîInstead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he‚Äôs giving them a foothold again.He refuses to call out Russia for its efforts to interfere in democracy.We need a president who will restore American integrity abroad.
In over 20 years of presidential debates, there hasn‚Äôt been a single question about how to address child poverty in America.We‚Äôve got to address the moral obscenities we‚Äôre facing and define ourselves not just by what we‚Äôre against but what we're for: 
We‚Äôve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and how we talk about each other in this debate matters. Tearing each other down didn‚Äôt work in 2016, and it won‚Äôt work in 2020. 
‚ÄúI stand with unions because right now, unions in America are under attack.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at  are seeing a stratification of wealth and income in this country. We must fight so that all union members have strong bargaining rights, good working conditions and a living wage.

The real question isn‚Äôt who is or isn‚Äôt a racist‚Äîthe question is who is or isn't doing something about it. As president, I will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes. 
I‚Äôve heard story after story about how farmers are struggling to survive because of corporate concentration in the ag sector. We need policies that support family farmers ; ranchers‚Äîthat‚Äôs what I‚Äôve fought for in the Senate ; will fight for as president. 
We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than in every single war we've been involved in, starting from the Revolutionary War, combined. As president, I will lead a movement for major reform of our gun safety laws. We can‚Äôt let this bloodshed continue. 
Saddened to hear of the passing of civil rights activist ; leader, Juanita Abernathy, who led the movement‚Äîfrom marching on Washington, boycotting in Montgomery, walking in Selma. Her spirit will live on through her tremendous contributions. My thoughts are with her loved ones.

If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.That's my best lesson‚Äîtrust people.That's what we need now‚Äîto unite in common cause and common purpose. Then, there‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt do as a nation.

Our criminal justice system treats you better if you‚Äôre rich ; guilty than poor ; innocent. Everyone on this stage should say they‚Äôre going to give clemency to the 17,000 people in jail unjustly‚Äîwe need to reform this system ; do it now. Every day we wait is too long. 
We know Donald Trump is a racist, but you don't get a badge of courage for calling him that. We need to focus on ending the systemic ways racism infects our society and laws every day.

This unconstitutional bill in South Carolina is just the latest example of the GOP trying to prevent women from accessing a critical health care service. We must continue to fight back. Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional right, and must always be protected.

My bill is based on a simple idea: if you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and possess a gun.We have the data: gun licensing will save lives. Congressional inaction is proving deadly‚Äîwe must act now to keep Americans safe.
Gun violence takes 100 lives every day in this country, but we know what we can do right now to save thousands of lives‚Äîgun licensing, universal background checks, assault weapons bans ; more. We just need leaders with the moral courage ; determination to get it done.

When I went to DC they said we couldn't reform our broken justice system. But we passed the First Step Act ; began to turn the tide of mass incarceration. The fight for criminal justice reform is far from over‚ÄîI'm looking forward to this conversation about the next steps forward. 
This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office‚Äîthis election is a referendum on who we are, and who we must be to each other. It is a referendum on the spirit of our country‚Äîand America, we will rise. 
Our challenges‚Äîfrom corporate corruption to campaign finance to criminal justice ; more‚Äîare interrelated. We can‚Äôt focus on each in a vacuum. So when we discuss health care, let‚Äôs not just talk about doctors ; nurses, let‚Äôs also talk about healthy food systems ; our environment.

It‚Äôs absurd that we live in a nation where someone who was convicted of stalking their girlfriend can still go out ; buy a gun.Where you could be on a terrorist no-fly list ; still be able to go to a gun show ; buy a trunk-load full of weapons.We need to change our gun laws.

This move by the Trump Administration would roll back what tenuous protections currently exist for migrant children. Let's get a few things straight: kids don't belong in prison and family detention isn't an alternative to separation. 
 ‚ÄòNobody seems to care about Black bodies and Black kids dying‚Äô ‚Äî spoke with formerly incarcerated people about‚Ä¶
It's essential that our next president has a strong, Democratic Senate backing them up. Good to see you continuing the fight,  
Black women make only 61 cents to every $1 paid to white men‚Äîa wage gap that reflects how Black women‚Äôs work is too often undervalued ; underpaid. We must change this and close the gender wage gap.  
Climate change must be the lens through which we view everything‚Äîit‚Äôs the existential crisis of our lifetime and the only way we're going to deal with this threat is if the United States leads. 
Blown away, LA! Thank you for an incredible evening. 
Thank you for advancing the conversation about the urgent threat of climate change‚Äîour country is better for it. I know you will continue to be a powerful voice and move the needle on this issue. We'll be right there with you.
12-year-old Asher asked me one of the more thought-provoking questions I've received on the trail. Thank you, Asher, for your advocacy! 
We're flying one winner (and their guest!) to the third  in Houston!‚úàÔ∏è Flights on usüè† Lodging on usü§≥ Selfies includedChip in and you‚Äôll be automatically entered for a chance to win: 
We don't have to wait to see the effects of climate change‚Äîwe're living them. Brazil‚Äôs Amazon rainforest has been burning for the last 3 weeks, and it's hardly given a second thought. We need to be paying better attention. 
 Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon is backing Democrat for president, giving a boost to the New Jersey U.S. s‚Ä¶
We need a movement election and we need a movement leader‚Äîsomeone who can excite and energize Americans to get engaged in our democracy. That‚Äôs how we're running this race‚Äîand that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to win. 
My thoughts about the president trying to buy Greenland: It's a betrayal of our values to strip Planned Parenthood of Title X funding, and the NRA shouldn't be dictating national gun policy. 
Traveling through states that Trump won last election I‚Äôm more confident than ever that this election will be different‚Äîwe will bring our country together to dream bigger and take on bolder challenges. 
Gun manufacturers should be held accountable for their role in our nation‚Äôs gun violence epidemic. We need to end legal immunity and help survivors of gun violence seek justice.  
The epidemic of gun violence in this country has led to a toxin of fear that‚Äôs starting to take over‚Äîand it's because of the inaction of leaders like Trump who ultimately are responsible. What's it going to take for us to do the common-sense things that we know will save lives? 
Thank you for your leadership, Aaron‚ÄîI couldn't agree more. We need to confront the rise of hate crimes and white supremacist violence in this country. That's why I announced a plan to confront this growing threat:  
We're days away from our big Weekend of Action! Hope you‚Äôll join for some exciting volunteer activities. Please RSVP here:  
This attack on reproductive health by the Trump Administration will have a devastating effect‚Äîparticularly on people with low incomes, communities of color ; rural areas. Congress must reverse this harmful gag rule ; protect these critical services.  
Necessary but far from the justice Garner's family deserved. That this result took 5 years is a travesty. We urgently need to fix our broken criminal justice system and build communities where people aren‚Äôt afraid of those who are supposed to protect them. 
So grateful to have your support, David, and inspired by your incredible work in Wisconsin. Looking forward to winning your state together in 2020. 
As president I won‚Äôt wait to take on the epidemic of gun violence in our country. On Day One, I will:‚úÖ Keep guns out of the wrong hands with gun licensing‚úÖ Hold gun manufacturers accountable‚úÖ Bring the fight to the NRA 
I will use the full force of the presidency to combat hate crimes and root out white supremacist threats wherever they are. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to do it:  
We still have so far to go to make the promise of our nation real, and achieve equal access to the ballot box for all Americans‚Äîlet‚Äôs keep up the fight.
But let's not be mistaken. The fight for that fundamental right to vote is far from over for too many Americans‚Äîparticularly for people of color and others who face voter suppression and other steep barriers to vote.
Today marks 99 years since the 19th Amendment was ratified and women were granted the right to vote‚Äîthe hard-won result of generations of Americans who fought for their fundamental right to have their voices heard.
We as a faith community need to come together and turn our faith into action‚Äîbecause faith without works is dead, and we need to bring this nation back to life. 
We need to close the wealth gap‚Äîthe inequality we‚Äôre seeing today hurts everyone except the rich ; well-connected ; prevents a level playing field. My baby bonds bill goes a long way toward bridging this divide ; virtually closes the racial wealth gap. 
I‚Äôve seen the death and carnage from gun violence up close‚Äîit‚Äôs something that we see every day in America, especially in neighborhoods like mine. It must end, and as president, I will bring a fight to the NRA like it's never seen, with a personal passion to change our laws. 
My haircut may have started out as a preemptive strike on an inevitable conclusion, but it's clearly the only way to go‚Äîtoo many of our fellow Americans still need to join the club. Great seeing you, brother! 
For too long we've let the gun debate be framed by the NRA ; corporate gun lobby. We need to regain the narrative‚Äîit‚Äôs an assault on our basic American liberties that we can‚Äôt go to a shopping mall, synagogue, or concert without fear of violence. Enough. 
Why do you think Russians and Republicans are doing everything they can to subvert African American votes? It‚Äôs because they often realize our power more than we do‚Äîand the most common way we give up our power is not realizing we have it in the first place. If we vote, we'll win. 
The power of the people is always greater than the people in power. Standing with these students and the people of Hong Kong during their peaceful protest for freedom. 
It‚Äôs been 400 years since the first slaves were first brought here in chains. We've been living the consequences of our nation's original sin ever since. Please join me in reading this deeply powerful  series. 
Today on what would've been Nipsey Hussle‚Äôs 34th birthday, we honor his life ; legacy of art ; community empowerment. His death was a tragic reminder that far too many Black men‚Äôs lives are cut short by gun violence. So today we celebrate his life ; recommit to this urgent fight.
Right-wing extremists have been behind the majority of terrorist attacks in this country since 9/11‚Äîand most of them were white supremacists.These acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum. We need to act to prevent more violence. Read my plan:  
From one former mayor to another‚Äîgrateful for your run and commitment to bring more positivity into our politics. We'll miss you out on the trail! 
Trump‚Äôs constant attacks on Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib are no secret to Israeli leadership. Reversing this decision would demonstrate they understand the dangerous nature of Trump‚Äôs racist rhetoric both here at home and around the world. 
Yes, we need to change our gun laws‚Äîand I have the most far-reaching plan of any other candidate to do that‚Äîbut we also need to confront the ugly reality of rising hate crimes and white supremacist violence in our country.Here‚Äôs my plan:  
Listen to the man‚Äîplease. 
Some important information for Newark residents: 
Iowans have long deserved better than Steve King and his hateful, insulting words. He should resign.We can show him it's time to go by donating to the guy who will beat him‚Äîmy inspiring friend  
Newark‚Äôs water emergency demands our federal government‚Äôs immediate attention. Everyone deserves clean, safe water‚Äîit's shameful that our national crisis of lead-contaminated water disproportionately hits poor black and brown communities like my own.
So I gotta say, the Iowa State Fair this weekend was‚Ä¶ fairly amazing! 
So excited for my friend and this new important effort to ensure our elections are free ; fair, especially in states where elections are often decided by the smallest of margins. Please join me in watching her live speech and signing up at  
If we're not doing everything we can to stop dangerous people from getting their hands on guns, we're not doing enough. Inaction is complicity. My plan to  
This administration‚Äôs cruel new policy called  is another racist policy that targets the less fortunate ; is intended to prevent certain immigrants from becoming citizens ; voters. It‚Äôs wrong ; goes against our values. I will reverse it as president. 
How did we get to a place where our fellow citizens are being slaughtered in houses of worship, in nightclubs, at concerts‚Äîchildren shot hiding under their desks. As president, I will pass gun safety legislation ; bring a fight to the NRA like they‚Äôve never seen. Enough. 
I stand with and airline workers demanding an end to poverty wages and unaffordable health insurance. One job should be enough to survive in this country. 
Loved the energy in the room, NYC! 
2 years ago, our nation watched in horror at the acts of violence ; racism in Charlottesville. Last week, 22 people were murdered in another act of white supremacist violence targeting Latinx people in El Paso. We all must speak out against this growing threat of white supremacy.
You can‚Äôt lead the people if you don‚Äôt love the people. Thank you, Milwaukee, for a truly special evening‚ÄîI love you all! 
It‚Äôs long past time we pass meaningful common sense gun safety that makes our children and our families safe. 
How we  federal gun licensing program‚úÖ universal background checks‚úÖ ban assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks‚úÖ close loopholes that allow domestic abusers ; people on terrorist watchlists to buy gunsMy full plan: 
Tonight marks the start of Eid al-Adha, when Muslims across the United States and around the world honor charity, sacrifice, and community. Wishing all those celebrating a blessed Eid! 
Our nation‚Äôs patchwork of state gun laws is failing which is why bills passed by New Hampshire Democrats represented significant progress‚Äînot just for New Hampshire but for the entire region. The Governor‚Äôs vetoes of these common-sense solutions are wrong. 
 This Sunday on  with at 9a ET: Tune in! 
I was blessed to be in IA today for my Aunt Alma's homegoing. Alma was my family's matriarch, and she lived a rich ; long life before passing away at the age of 100. I'll miss my her very much, but am comforted by the fact that while death can end a life, it can never end a love. 
Or just pay women and men equally. 
 Here‚Äôs the video clip of the actual event. It is ok not to be ok. And yes, I was brave enough to shave my head!  h‚Ä¶
 Sunday on and more 
Gotta admit...that is one of the best looking haircuts I've ever seen. Proud of you, brother‚Äîyour bravery inspires. 
The ICE raid in Mississippi left frightened children stranded at school while their parents were taken away‚Äîwe're horrified and heartbroken but we can do something right now. Please turn your outrage into action ; support these families: 
Until Black people are no longer disproportionately killed by police, we should lift the voices of those like the protestors who stand up for justice‚Äîand speak out ourselves for a more fair criminal justice system that holds police accountable. To be silent is to be complicit.
I am also thinking about the everyday citizens who stood against this police violence and racism and were tear gassed for their patriotic acts. Ferguson called to the conscience of our nation and inspired a movement that rightly continues.
5 years ago, Michael Brown was killed by a police officer. His body lay on the street for hours before he was treated with humanity. I have been thinking all day about Mike and his family, and my prayers are with them.
As a former mayor who understands the unique challenges and trauma that gun violence brings to cities, I support these mayors‚Äîno one knows better than them what their communities need, and we should listen. 
Thank you Walmart employees for demanding action. Walmart should use its power to stop selling guns in its stores until politicians and gun manufacturers get their act together and raise the standard for gun ownership in this country. 
The UN report makes it clear: farmers and ranchers can help lead the way in lowering emissions and combating climate change.My new climate change bill would make this happen‚Äîwe need leaders who will act with urgency.  
Thank you ; for using your platform to lift issues like criminal justice reform, women's rights, health care ; more. We know how important it is to support our communities not just with words but with actions‚Äîproud to work with you to make that happen. 
Moved by the powerful voices and leaders who‚Äôve signed on to this op-ed, and proud to stand with them in condemning the hate and division we are seeing in this country. 
The climate crisis demands bold action‚Äîmy new bill will:‚úÖReduce or offset 1/3 of emissions from the ag sector‚úÖPlant 15+ billion trees‚úÖInvest in renewable energy for farmers‚úÖRestore 2+ million acres of coastal wetlands‚úÖCreate hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs 
The moral vandalism of this administration has no end‚Äîhow is traumatizing these kids, abandoning them, making anyone any safer? 
America has shown greatness, not because of the absence of violent bigotry and white supremacy, but because of our efforts to overcome it. We must now dedicate ourselves, as our ancestors did, to being freedom fighters‚Äîfor liberty is one of our most sacred civic values. 
Thank you, Philly, for braving a torrential downpour to meet with me tonight! 
 Great talking with you‚Äîstrong communities start with strong local leadership. Looking forward to seeing you soon!
Don't look away‚Äîthe Trump Administration is continuing to terrorize immigrants and separate families. This is a moment of moral crisis in our country‚Äîwe must do better. 
We must change our laws, but we must also confront our past. 
‚ÄúThere is only one way to get there‚Äîand that‚Äôs together.¬†Only one way to win‚Äîwith the power, the healing, and the salvation we find in love.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
‚ÄúWe must now dedicate ourselves, as our ancestors did, to being freedom fighters‚Äîfor liberty is one of our most sacred civic values.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt lead the people if you don‚Äôt love the people‚Äîall the people.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs with faith in God, in one another, and in who we can be that we come here together today.¬†Not because of hate, but because of love.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory
‚ÄúWhen evil showed itself in this church basement four years ago ‚Ä¶ this church showed us how not to allow hate, when it comes into our lives, to take root in our souls.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
There is another story we can tell about our country.Not one that ignores our mistakes or accommodates our failures.¬†Not one that glorifies singular heroes or the so-called ‚Äúgreat men‚Äù of our history.¬†A story about who we can be ‚Ä¶ together.
‚ÄúWe have the power to act. And we can act to legislate safety even if we cannot legislate love.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
‚ÄúBecause if the answer to the question ‚Äòdo racism and white supremacy exist?‚Äô is yes,¬†then the real question isn't who is or isn't a racist, but who is and isn't doing something about it.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory
‚ÄúOur work is not complete by calling out the shortcomings of our leaders ‚Ä¶ Each person, each generation has a decision to make: do you want to contribute to our collective advancement or‚Äîthrough inaction or worse‚Äîto our collective retrenchment.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory
‚ÄúThe act of anti-Latino, anti-immigrant hatred we witnessed this past weekend did not start with the hand that pulled the trigger ‚Ä¶ it was planted in fertile soil, because the contradictions that have shadowed this country since its founding remain a part of who we are.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory
"White supremacy allows political leaders to promise to 'build the wall'‚Äîwhile not building hospitals, schools, or infrastructure.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
‚ÄúAs much as white supremacy manifests itself in dangerous and deadly acts of terror, it is perpetuated by what is too often a willful ignorance or dangerous tolerance of its presence in our society.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory
"Silence in the face of these injustices is a choice. To be passive is to be complicit. To ignore hate is to empower it.¬†It is to fall back on that easy false virtue of tolerance.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
‚ÄúWhite supremacy has always been a problem in our American story‚Äîif not always at the surface, then lurking not so far beneath it.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
‚ÄúTo love our country in this moment means we must step outside our comfort zones and confront that which is within ourselves.‚Äù ‚ÄîCory at Mother Emanuel
About to speak at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC about gun violence and the rising tide of hatred and white nationalism in our country. Watch live: 
We can‚Äôt wait to take action on gun violence‚Äîit's on all of us right now to demand we do something differently. 
If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to own and operate a gun.I‚Äôll get this done as president:

Today especially, I'm reminded just how important it is we elect people with the highest moral character to represent us‚Äîpeople like Iowa‚Äôs 4th District deserves so much more than what Steve King has given, and they couldn‚Äôt ask for better than JD. 
To be silent is to be complicit. I look forward to speaking on Wednesday. 
The president is weak. And wrong.White supremacy is not a mental illness, and guns are a tool that white supremacists use to fulfill their hate.
Gun violence cannot be normalized, regardless of where it happens.El Paso. Dayton. Chicago. We‚Äôre in a crisis. To my colleagues who say that now isn‚Äôt the time for politics‚ÄîAmerican lives are at stake. We need to act.
This is a national crisis. Mitch McConnell needs to bring the Senate back from recess right now and hold votes on legislation to protect Americans from gun violence. Enough. We need to end this carnage now.
One of the lessons in my faith is that you reap what you sow. When Donald Trump uses words like ‚Äúinfestation,‚Äù ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù and ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù‚ÄîWhen he refuses to condemn Neo-Nazis and white supremacists‚ÄîTrump is giving license to this kind of violence. He‚Äôs responsible. 
Enough. We need to end this national nightmare. Praying for everyone affected by this unspeakable tragedy, and for our country to find the moral courage to take action to end this carnage. 
 ‚ÄúThis is not about one man in one office ‚Äî this is about all of us, together, and the love we show to our fellow country‚Ä¶

Maldonado is right. Pantaleo needs to go‚Äînow. 
Why are you like this? 
Too many Democrats stayed home in 2016 or were affected by Republican voter suppression or Russian interference. To win in 2020, we need to turn out Black voters, especially Black women, who are the heart of the Democratic Party.

Republicans want to pit some immigrants against others. But we need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says, ‚ÄúEveryone has worth and dignity, and this should be a country that honors everyone.‚Äù  
The person enjoying this debate the most is Donald Trump. As we pick each other apart, Republicans are trying to gut Obamacare. 
On Day One of his presidency, Cory will take immediate action to reform our broken immigration system.   
Health care is a right, not a privilege.  
The person enjoying this debate the most is Donald Trump. As we pick each other apart, Republicans are trying to gut Obamacare. 
To the folks who were standing up to Mayor de Blasio a few minutes ago‚Äîgood for you. That's how change is made.  
We know who Donald Trump is. But this election isn‚Äôt about him‚Äîit‚Äôs about who we are. We have serious problems in this country‚Äîbut we are a people who desperately want to heal and move forward, to unite in common purpose. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôll beat him. 2/2

In many states, there are laws preventing an abusive spouse from purchasing a gun, but those same laws do not apply to current or ex-dating partners‚Äîthis makes no sense. My plan to end gun violence would close the ‚ÄúBoyfriend Loophole‚Äù once and for all:  
The right to vote is sacred, and we should make it easier for everyone, not harder. Our democracy is strongest when more people join in it. As president, I will fight to protect and expand every American‚Äôs right to take part in our democracy.

Projecting much? 
It‚Äôs no secret we‚Äôre an underdog in this race‚Äîbut to have 130,000 people (and counting!) embrace our campaign‚Äôs message and step up by making a contribution is truly something special. Thank you to everyone who chipped in‚Äîlet‚Äôs keep it going! Donate here:

The War on Drugs is a war on people‚Äîone that disproportionately hurts people of color ; the poor. On Day One as president, I‚Äôll use my pardon power to set in motion a historic clemency process for those serving excessive sentences from our failed drug war. 
The Trump administration is targeting the most vulnerable in our society: The poor, the elderly, and children. Under its proposed policy, 3 million Americans in need could lose the ability to put food on the table. This is outrageous. 
This is painful.This is a moral, defining moment in America. Other generations had to answer: When the Know Nothings, McCarthy, Wallace and so many others sought to demean, degrade, demagogue and divide, What did you do?We must now answer. Silence is toxic complicity. 
Real superheroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things. George Allen, a home care worker in NV, is the very definition of this but we aren't doing right by him. He deserves a living wage and it's why I'm fighting for home care workers like George. 
These men got the best haircuts of their lives (maybe I‚Äôm biased!) AND earned $1,000 each for the charities of their choice for shaving their heads tonight in West Des Moines, Iowa.

Today I spoke at the about electability.The next Democratic party nominee must inspire ; earn the trust of our community. You can't say you‚Äôre going to be a champion for our communities when you become President if you haven‚Äôt been a champion already. 
The power of the people has always been greater than the people in power. This is an incredible victory for our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. 
One week from today I will be on the debate stage again and could not be more excited. I hope you‚Äôll be watching‚Äîand consider hosting a debate watch party in your community to get your neighbors involved. Here‚Äôs how: 
In next week‚Äôs second debate I hope to show Democrats across the country why our ideas need to be a part of the debate in September. To hear more about how I'm preparing, join me on our grassroots call today 5:45pm ET: 
 Thank you for having me!
 So good to see you!

Today's unrestrained fearmongering from Donald Trump harkens back to the dark days of George Wallace‚Äîexcept this time it's coming directly from the Oval Office. 
 It was a pleasure meeting you!! Can‚Äôt wait to come and visit!!!   
After the constant moral vandalism we‚Äôve seen from this administration, we need a leader who's going to call us to be the best of who we are. We will not beat Donald Trump by trying to be more like him, but by showing that we are not like him. 
Had so much fun at Comic-Con this weekend and got the chance to talk about my love for Star Trek, which had its first convention at the Newark Public Library in my city of Newark, NJ! 
Debate lineups are set. This is a big moment for our team. Please join our grassroots call tomorrow night at 5:45 pm ET during my debate prep session, and I‚Äôll fill you in on how I‚Äôm getting ready. 
It‚Äôs not enough to tell us what you‚Äôre going to do for our communities, show us what you‚Äôve done for the last 40 years. You created this system. We‚Äôll dismantle it.

76 billion opioids, 100,000 Americans killed. In just 7 years. Big Pharma's grip on our political system will only continue to make things worse‚Äîwe need to hold these companies accountable. 
Asylum seekers awaiting their court dates are being forced to stay in Mexico. Some have become victims of kidnappings, extortion and rape. I was recently invited down to the border to help apply pressure to get a group of women through our broken asylum process. 
Excited to join the debate stage on Wednesday, July 31! If you plan on watching, be sure to order our debate watch kits by tomorrow to have them arrive on time:  
On my first day as president I‚Äôll take executive action to go after gun manufacturers ; dealers, close dangerous loopholes, and invest in communities impacted by the epidemic of gun violence. We need an aggressive approach to win this fight. 
We can't be silent in the face of Trump's racist attacks. I'll defend anyone‚ÄîRepublican or Democrat‚Äîwho is attacked because of their religion, their ethnicity, or the color of their skin. I don't give a damn about the politics: racism is racism. To say nothing is to be complicit.

Yes, this election is a referendum on Donald Trump and his spewing of racism and bigotry‚Äîbut it's also a referendum on who we are, who we are to each other. 
I appreciated our discussion on how we fix our nation‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure‚Äîsomething that matters to thousands of working Americans. I‚Äôm dedicated to this issue and putting a plan in motion that fixes our currently broken system.
Thank you ; for inviting me to talk about key issues that matter to working people. We know unions are the gold standard to professionally train, educate ; recruit skilled tradespersons‚Äîthese programs must be protected against the looming threat of IRAPs. 
My hope is that the Second Look Act will create a much bigger pathway for people to be released in order to reunite families ; save taxpayer dollars. We must tear down this unjust system of mass incarceration that for too long has destroyed too many lives without making us safer. 
Just found out our debate lineup‚Äîexcited to be on stage July 31!We‚Äôre so close to crossing the 130,000 donor threshold to qualify for the fall debates. Can you chip in $1 to help guarantee our message is part of it? 
Leaders don‚Äôt follow consensus‚Äîthey mold it. 
It‚Äôs been reported that Attorney General Barr overruled DOJ attorneys who recommended charges for the officer who killed Eric Garner. Barr needs to explain why he did this‚Äîwhy he decided that no charges should be brought in a case where a violent homicide was captured on video. 
Big win for workers today‚Äîevery American should have the right to a job that pays a living wage. The Senate should continue the fight for economic justice and hold a vote on this critical bill as soon as possible. 
This is beyond cruel. I can‚Äôt begin to imagine the trauma this child and her parents went through in that moment. The moral bankruptcy of this administration's policies is leading to actions that do not reflect our values‚Äîwe can't lose sight of who we are as a country. 
The words Donald Trump chose to use were purposefully racist. He invoked a centuries-old weapon‚Äîa message not just to the four congresswomen but to all people of color: Your identity does not belong to you, your history does not belong to you, your body does not belong to you. 
My parents watched George Wallace on TV in black and white‚Äîtonight millions of Americans saw him in living color.

 Humbled and grateful to have you in my corner, Peter. Thank you.
Gun violence is the second-highest cause of death among young people, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be this way. We can save lives by implementing commonsense measures like my proposal for gun licensing‚Äîbecause if you need a license to drive a car, you should need one to own a gun. 
 Thank you for the kind words‚Äîalways enjoy speaking with the Emerge Network and appreciate the incredible work you all do.
The tough-on-crime movements of our past helped create a cruel and broken criminal justice system. The Second Look Act would take key steps to fix it, ensuring that people who do not deserve to be in prison will finally walk free. 
Great chatting with you, Ricardo! Looking forward to continuing the conversation and building together. 
Today marks 5 years since Eric Garner‚Äôs tragic death. May he rest in peace; may he one day see justice; and may we find the courage to fix the failures of our broken justice system‚Äîone that failed Eric again yesterday when it was reported his killer would not be held accountable.
John Paul Stevens served with integrity and honor on the Supreme Court for over 3 decades. He was a dedicated public servant who put the law and the Constitution ahead of politics. Saddened to hear of his passing. My deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. 
Nevada has been a special place to me for most of my life‚Äîit‚Äôs where my grandparents called home and where my mom currently lives. It‚Äôs a beautiful state that reflects the diversity and strength of our country‚ÄîI look forward to visiting again very soon! 
In one of the richest nations in the world, no person should ever go broke or have to quit their job in order to afford long-term care or take care of a loved one. 
This decision is wrong, unjust and painful reminder of just how broken our criminal justice system is. Eric Garner should be alive today. I pray his loved ones can find peace. 
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt rest on my laurels when I became one of the first Black women to work in the software company IBM‚Ä¶I took their missive as a challenge to change the culture and...lower the barriers for those who would come after me.‚Äù ~My mom, Carolyn Booker

We know that gun licensing has been effective in states like Massachusetts‚Äîbut almost 70% of all guns recovered in MA came from out of state. We need a national gun licensing program‚Äîa state-by-state patchwork approach isn‚Äôt enough. 
Exeter, NH: Thank you for your questions, your thoughts, and your ideas. What a night! 
Today in Nashua, NH, 8-year-old Scout asked me how we can better protect children like her from gun violence. This fight is personal for me‚ÄîI won‚Äôt stop until our schools, churches, movie theaters, and festivals are safe again. Scout, thank you for your question. 
Scout, who is homeschooled in part because her parents are worried about school shootings, asked me a question: How will I protect kids like her from gun violence? No other candidate is more determined to solve this problem‚Äîand I have a plan to back it up:  
Sandra Bland should still be with us‚Äîa routine traffic stop should never end this way. She was failed by our criminal justice system at every step ; we‚Äôre still waiting for justice ; accountability. We must keep her memory alive by making sure her tragic story is never forgotten.

Just wrapped up a conversation about the epidemic of gun violence in our communities. For too long, corporate gun interests have been allowed to frame this debate‚Äîit‚Äôs unacceptable, and why we need a comprehensive plan to end this crisis in America:

This is horrifying‚Äîand one of the many reasons why we need federal gun safety policies like comprehensive background checks and gun licensing. If you need a license to drive a car then you should need a license to own and operate a firearm. 
This is wrong on so many levels‚Äîcorporations should not be able to profit off of locking people up in cages, especially vulnerable people seeking asylum. We need to end private prisons‚Äîand we need immigration policies that put human dignity and safety first.

An urgent priority of ours must be to expand the right to participate in our democracy. So earlier this year I called for a new Voting Rights Act to put an end to systematic attempts to limit access to the ballot and strip citizens of their right to vote.

While in the detention center, she became sick. Despite the fact that the doctor wanted her to go to the hospital, border patrol refused. She was put in isolation and thought she would die.
Another of the women has bruises all over her back from sleeping on the hard floor of the detention center. She wasn‚Äôt able to shower for over 20 days and has rashes on her skin from the lack of sanitation.
She was so hungry while in detention that she said they would eat the peel of the orange.

Our immigration system should reflect our values, and right now, it does not. As president, Cory Booker will make sure that our immigration system treats immigrants with dignity because when people cross borders, they bring their human rights with them. Are you with him?

Cory Booker has a plan to virtually eliminate immigration detention, protect Dreamers, and end for-profit detention centers. Read more from POLITICO today ‚Äî
Beginning on Day One of my presidency, I‚Äôll use my executive authority to reform our badly broken immigration system‚Äîwithout Congress. Here‚Äôs how: 
We must end our nation‚Äôs reliance on immigration incarceration, including ending the use of for-profit detention facilities. And that‚Äôs what my plan calls for:  
We should dramatically expand the level of federal investment to support Black entrepreneurship and small business development. My op-ed outlines some of my ideas to do just that: 
My immigration policies will reflect our values. We should have the facilities and resources to honor immigrants' human dignity.

Brooklyn Lindsey was the 11th known Black trans woman murdered this year. These individual acts of hatred are not just singular instances of unspeakable violence ‚Äî they reveal our collective failure. And to make change, we must act. Lives depend on it. 
Kids are being torn from their parents at our border and held in cages‚ÄîI won‚Äôt wait for Congress to solve this crisis. On Day One of my presidency, we will take immediate steps to end this administration‚Äôs moral vandalism. Here‚Äôs my plan to do it: 
Today, we celebrate the signing of the Civil Rights Act. But the first photo wouldn't have happened without the second. Change doesn't come because a group of guys in suits makes it, it happens because a group of people united is willing to fight for it.  
This report is nothing short of horrific. My heart is breaking for these families‚Äîwe need to take action to end this cruelty immediately.

This isn‚Äôt about a hoodie. It‚Äôs about a culture that sees a problem with a kid wearing a hoodie in the first place. Our nominee needs to have the language to talk about race in a far more constructive way.

The Supreme Court just announced it will take up the DACA case next term. Let‚Äôs be clear: Dreamers are Americans, and Trump‚Äôs decision to terminate DACA was illegal. 
The America I'm fighting for is one where Black trans women aren't murdered weekly. Where LGBTQ children can go to school without fear. It's not enough to say we want equality, we need to protect our LGBTQ communities from violence ; stomp out the hatred they face daily. 
There are racial issues we‚Äôve got to deal with in our country ; the next nominee is going to have to be able to talk about this in an open, honest way without falling into a defensive crouch‚Äîwe need a president who will help our country heal ; deal with these difficult issues. 
We set a goal earlier tonight to hit $15k in donations to my campaign‚Äîwe just passed that.We also had our second largest fundraising day since we launched this campaign. Thank YOU.

Adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census was a racist attempt to silence immigrant communities. For now, that‚Äôs not happening. I'm pleased with today's ruling, but we need to continue to fight these not-so-subtle moves when we see them.

Donald Trump wants us to fight on his turf and his terms. But this election isn‚Äôt about him‚Äîit‚Äôs about us and showing the best of who we are.  
We have a nation that has more African Americans under criminal supervision now than all the slaves in 1850. Criminal justice reform wasn‚Äôt something we could wait on a Senate majority for.  
We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially trans African Americans and the especially high rates of murder right now. It‚Äôs not enough just to be on the Equality Act, we need to have a president who will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans every day. 
Getting things done in the Senate takes conviction and a commitment to building coalitions, but policies like the First Step Act are proof that we can do it. 
Addressing the gun violence epidemic demands bold solutions.    
Kids shouldn‚Äôt have to go to school to learn reading, writing and arithmetic‚Äîand how to deal with an active shooter.The corporate gun lobby has framed this debate. We need bold actions and a bold agenda. This isn‚Äôt about policy‚Äîit‚Äôs personal.  
We have a better way to solve the problems in our immigration system‚Äîwe don‚Äôt need to criminalize those seeking asylum. 
On Day One, I will make sure we end the ICE and CBP policies that are violating human rights. Every person deserves the right to seek asylum in our country. 
Access to affordable health care is so much more than that. It‚Äôs an education issue, an economic issue. We have to do things immediately that provide better care. That means fighting for Medicare for All ; acting with urgency to protect health care for all people.

It‚Äôs not enough to simply decriminalize marijuana‚Äîwe must repair the damage done to those communities that have been most harmed by the failed War on Drugs. That means bringing the thousands who are serving unjust sentences home. 
This election is about women.This election is about minorities.This election is about low-income people.This election is about ALL of us‚Äîand that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to fight and win. 
No soap to wash their bodies. No beds to sleep on. And there's little food. We're not talking about the past, this is happening in the present. We'll be judged on this moment in our country, but my God, let's not wait another minute to end this now.

Since my early days as a tenant organizer, I've pushed for more renters' rights. This is a win, but we have to do more. That means increasing the supply of affordable units, passing my renters tax credit, and providing a national right to counsel for folks facing eviction.

This is great news, we can't talk about decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana without talking about expunging records. 
Men, let's stop using our relationships with women as a reason to care about reproductive freedom. This is a fight for us all.
The War on Drugs is a war on people, but not all people. It has disproportionately affected Black communities, low-income people, veterans, people living with mental illness. As president, I will fight to reform the criminal justice system like I've been doing in the Senate. 
I'll be blunt. No matter who wins, even if it isn't me, people unjustly incarcerated must be liberated‚Äîand I need everyone in this field to agree with me. 
 I agree. It‚Äôs not enough to simply decriminalize marijuana‚Äîwe must repair the damage done to those communities. My Marijuana Justice Act aims to do just that.
We need to get people who are serving excessive sentences home‚Äîsentences for involvement in something 2 out of the last 3 presidents have admitted doing. The War on Drugs was a failure‚Äîit's time we right that wrong.  
 Absolutely. Clemency is just the first step. We're working to make sure that there are job opportunities, that records get expunged, and that we invest in communities that have been ravaged by the War on Drugs.
Oh! I can assure you that Brussels sprouts are comfort food 
This administration cannot claim to care about Americans and then deny such a basic right to half the population. This attack on health care will not go unnoticed‚Äîwe won't stop fighting until we have reproductive freedom for all.

We've watched enough of this trauma in viral videos to understand that it's not unusual. There's no room for a system where humans are treated this way ; we need to get serious about racial bias training ; real police oversight to stop this brutality. 
 thank you for sharing your story. Not only are these fees an economic burden, they prevent families from connecting with loved ones‚Äîconnection that could determine whether someone rehabilitates or returns to jail. This is a step in the right direction. 
The goal isn't just to stop the attack on Roe v. Wade. The goal is to advance women's rights and show the country what we already know to be true...Abortion is health care. Contraception is health care. Reproductive freedom is health care ...
It‚Äôs time to make a meaningful investment in Black entrepreneurship and economic empowerment. We can‚Äôt have large sections of our population denied equal access and think it‚Äôs not a cancer that affects the rest of the country as well. We need justice for all, now.
And, we will make sure working Americans have more money in their pocket by fixing the tax code, making housing more affordable, addressing the crushing student debt crisis and ensuring that higher education is not out of reach. 
We will boost entrepreneurship by expanding training programs and invest $1.5 billion into the State Small Business Credit Initiative. We will reform our criminal justice system so that people affected by the failed War on Drugs can apply for loans and have access to capital.
As president, I will work to close that gap. My Baby Bonds proposal will create an interest-bearing savings account for every child born in the US. By age 18, the most impoverished kids would have access to nearly $50,000 to start a new business or put a down payment on a home. 
White families hold nearly 10 times the wealth of Black families. Considering $30,000 is about the average startup capital to launch a business (almost double the net worth of a median Black family), it‚Äôs no surprise we have economic inequality.
Black-owned businesses are so important to our communities‚Äîthey create jobs and help families build wealth‚Äîbut barriers to accessing capital and other racial inequities leave many unable to fully participate in our nation‚Äôs economic growth.
On  this year, I‚Äôm thinking about my dad ; how he was able to move our family from poverty to the middle class within the span of a single generation. This all thanks to the North Carolina family that took him in ; their small business‚Äîa Black-owned funeral home.

Today, the median white family has nearly 10 times the net worth of Black families. It's time to reverse damaging policy that leaves people behind ; put measures in place to ensure that kids in our country don't have to rely on the goodness of community or chance to build wealth.
The same for purchasing property. With a Baby Bonds account, nearly half of all young adults could put a down payment on a home by age 30. 
This nest egg could change lives and generations. Even with the high cost of college, Baby Bonds would cover tuition for most young adults. 
My Baby Bonds plan is simple: Give every child a savings account of $1,000 at birth. Every year, depending on family income, the child would be eligible for up to $2,000 + interest until they turn 18. That means the lowest-income children could have a nest egg of nearly $50,000.
That's commendable, but it shouldn't have to be that way. Upward mobility is too often determined by generational wealth and zip codes‚Äîand the racial wealth gap keeps widening. With my Baby Bonds proposal, we have the opportunity to give every family a fighting chance.
My dad used to say he was Po'. Not poor‚Äîhe couldn't afford the other two letters. So he made it to college not because of his parents' ability to pay for it, but through the collection plate at church and the generosity of his community.

Flint's poisoned water is a tragedy, but it's not an anomaly‚Äîit's happening all over America. And that's why we need to act to address environmental injustices now.

What a stark difference that the same people who claim to care about all lives are doing nothing to protect migrant children. I am saddened at the news coming from our border‚Äîvaluing all life means extending humanity to people seeking a better one. 
This is a question I've been getting a lot in recent weeks. As president, I will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land. Almost 50 years after Roe was decided, this shouldn't even be a debate. 
Anti-choice members of the Missouri Senate just passed another abortion ban in the dead of night. Let me repeat‚Äîthis is a coordinated effort to repeal Roe v. Wade. It's wrong, it's unconstitutional and we need to codify Roe so it doesn't work. 
Men, we have to get up off the sidelines and fight this attack on women's reproductive rights the same way women have been doing. 
 Presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker told BuzzFeed News that if he becomes president, he wants Congress to make abortion‚Ä¶
 I‚Äôm deeply moved and motivated by your words and your loss...WE will change this together. I hope others will share their story to help prevent more people from sharing your pain.
And today, when the attacks on women's rights feel particularly acute, we must put our money where our mouths are to support women. Please join me and consider donating to and other organizations doing critical work: 
We must pass federal laws to protect women‚Äôs rights. We need to codify Roe v. Wade into law and fully fund Planned Parenthood. We must repeal the Hyde Amendment.
Men, it's on us to speak out too. It's on us to take action. Not because women are our mothers, wives, daughters. Because women are people. And all people deserve to control their own bodies.
The Alabama abortion ban is part of a coordinated, all-out effort to erode women‚Äôs reproductive rights and freedom nationwide. But let me be clear: Women shouldn't have to face this fight alone. 
We can talk about what we want to do to fix the problems facing our country, but are we actually listening? Grateful for moments like this that remind me of our collective power. The presidency isn't an autocracy‚Äîit's an office that belongs to the people. Listen to the people. 
Annie, it was so nice to see you in Concord. From fighting the opioid epidemic to supporting protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Granite Staters are benefiting from your leadership. Thank you! 
 Today Alabama passed the most extreme ban on abortion we‚Äôve seen since Roe v. Wade.
The Alabama Senate just stripped women of health care rights by voting to make abortion procedures a felony. I will fight in solidarity with women to make sure rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade will not be threatened by those who have no business making laws about their bodies. 
I know these measures work because we‚Äôve watched the suicide rate decrease in places that have them. We can do this. As your president, I won‚Äôt be afraid to act to reduce firearm suicide and save more lives.

A fire was intentionally set to the Diyanet Mosque in New Haven during Ramadan. Crimes like this are meant to terrify ; intimidate. But it won't work. Islamophobia is reprehensible, and we will defend our Muslim brothers ; sisters in the face of hate. 
We have to do all we can to prevent firearm suicide. That means licensing for guns, requiring safe storage of firearms, expansion of suicide prevention training for health professionals and more. 
Get well, President Carter! This news certainly put me in a fowl mood, but I know you‚Äôll be on the mend soon. 
From our hiring practices to our engagement on policy and on the ground, inclusion of AAPI communities is important to our campaign. We're excited to continue to listen, learn, and build together. 
Every graduation season, I think about how so many will be held back by crushing student loan debt. I want you to know that I see you. And as president, I will do everything in my power to protect borrowers ; create debt-free college for future students to eliminate that burden. 
Providing access to prenatal care and doulas and extending postpartum care doesn't just cut maternal and infant mortality‚Äîit cuts the cost of health care overall. It's really that simple. 
Wow, what an innovative and creative way to inspire folks. Thank you for remembering those we lost and reminding people why we have to fight to end gun violence. You are what this country needs more of. Congratulations on your graduation! 
Assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks have been responsible for some of the deadliest mass shootings in our country. Let‚Äôs be clear‚Äîthey are made for no other purpose than to kill people quickly and efficiently. And we need to ban them for good. 
Abortion is health care. Maternal care is health care. And women should make their own health care decisions. 
I am incredibly lucky to spend  with my mom this year. When she joined me on the campaign trail this weekend, it reminded me of the selflessness ; commitment mothers in all capacities have for those they care for. Today, we want to let you know you are appreciated.

We can't say we care about gun safety reform ; then ignore cities where gun violence is shattering communities daily. Baltimore experienced a mass shooting yesterday ; it deserves our attention. Gun violence is a national epidemic‚Äîour outrage can't be determined by zip codes.

Agent Orange in the Passaic River. Lead in Flint's water.Manganese dust in Chicago.This is what happens when polluters go unchecked. As president, I'll strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency's power and hold those poisoning our communities accountable. 
The people of New Orleans deserve an infrastructure that won‚Äôt fail at a moment‚Äôs notice. My friend is doing an incredible job leading here. 
Thank you to everyone in the who stayed up all night fighting for working families and their right to a secure retirement. Grateful for your leadership! 
My 50th birthday is in two days ; I‚Äôm inviting you to celebrate with me by committing to 50 minutes of community service with your friends this Saturday. All you have to do is sign up here to host an event (or find one near you). Hope you can join us:

Fact: Wages for the lowest-income workers in this country have barely risen in four decades but corporate profits are at an 80-plus year high. Something is wrong with that picture. 
 We should all commend commitment to renewable energy options‚Äîleadership like this is what will make us a stronger country (and a healthier planet). Congratulations!
If you live in a community like mine, climate change isn‚Äôt just some future threat‚Äîit‚Äôs an urgent problem right now.  
This is a poll tax. 
We all owe a debt to women of color for their leadership. Today at I was honored to hear their questions. As your president, I will make sure that inclusion isn't just a box-checking exercise‚Äîit will mean having your voice heard at all times in this country. 
I can't stress how important and huge this win is, not just for Tampa, but for our country as we build a society reflective of all its peoples. Tampa, you did it. Congratulations again,

Having face-to-face conversations is often the best way to learn about the most important issues affecting communities...Grateful to for bringing me along this morning to knock on doors and see firsthand the incredible work they do for communities of color. 
 So awesome. Thank you Rick for having me join this morning!
 Just another day in the life:  Knocking doors with US Senator and Presidential Candidate Cory Booker!   
My heart breaks for Nigel and his family. We have to build a world where LGBTQ kids feel loved and affirmed in their identities. We honor Nigel by fighting for such a world every day. 
Milwaukee, thank you for having me today to discuss gun violence in our communities. I refuse to offer "thoughts ; prayers" alone‚Äîas my mom would say, faith without works is dead. We need action on gun safety measures like universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.

I'm on a mission in this campaign to make people's lives better. And really, that's the number one priority. 
This is not up for debate: Fair wages and benefits should be extended to all working Americans in this country. Inspired by Stop ; Shop employees, who demanded their voices be heard and their work valued. 
Views of our home from space never get old. Happy  
Thank you for having me It is truly inspiring to see what's possible for our country when leadership finds solutions that benefit both our environment and our economy. Plants like this one are the future. 
On  we can't forget communities that experience the biggest consequences of air pollution, water contamination, and more. The Environmental Justice Caucus will ensure that protecting our planet also means protecting our most vulnerable.
 I am honored to have you join team It was great seeing you and your family last week. I look forward to being back in Iowa soon. Thank you for your hard work in the Iowa House! 
Students are the ones who will have to deal with the decisions lawmakers make for decades to come‚Äîprotecting their right to vote is paramount. Thank you, for leading the fight in New Hampshire to protect student voters. I'm proud to support this fight. 
Five years after one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in our history, Flint still doesn't have clean water. And we're still fighting for clean water in places like Newark, Pittsburgh, ; Detroit. Who are we if we can't guarantee this basic right to Americans? 
Taking time to reflect on the enduring power of grace this Easter morning. Happy Easter to everyone celebrating! 
The Apostle Paul wrote, "Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep." On a day meant for celebration, so many families in Sri Lanka are devastated, and my heart breaks along with theirs. There's absolutely no justification for this.

 Great breaking bread with my friend Welcome back to Vegas! 
I hope the force is with us. Thanks for having me, Ben! Happy to help you and carry on this tradition. Send me a picture of the model next year when it's complete! 
Blessed to meet with such an inspiring group of women today. The generous hospitality they showed to me and my team while sharing personal, harrowing stories of our immigration system is a lesson for us all about common decency, humanity and family. 
Columbine was 20 years ago, and yet we still haven‚Äôt taken meaningful action to stop gun violence. Enough is enough‚Äîwe can't wait for progress. People are getting shot every day. It was time then, and it's time now.
The New Colossus says, ‚ÄúGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free." Nowhere does it say kidnap families seeking a better life. These vigilantes are pointing to the administration as their license to do this. 
The Marijuana Justice Act wouldn‚Äôt just legalize marijuana‚Äîit would expunge the records of millions of people who have been hurt by the War on Drugs.
As we work to legalize marijuana nationwide, we‚Äôve got to also ensure equity in the marijuana industry. Communities that have been historically targeted by the failed War on Drugs can't be left out of opportunities to participate in the legal marijuana economy.
Thanks so much for having me! We‚Äôve got to make sure workers are included in company buyback profits‚Äînot just shareholders. 
The Passover story‚Äîone of redemption and freedom‚Äîis among the most powerful we have. Chag Pesach Sameach to everyone celebrating!

In the wealthiest country in the world, we've got to do more to ensure hard-working Americans can provide for themselves and their families. This plan will lift 15 million Americans out of poverty and help nearly half of all Americans pay for the rising cost of living.
A cost-of-living refund matters to a low-income student who under the current code is excluded from benefits. The Rise Credit will help‚Äî30 percent of college students in this country struggle just to buy food.
That matters to people caring for kids or elderly or sick family members, whose annual out-of-pocket costs to support their loved ones can reach the thousands. Combined with their own cost of living, the expenses can be crippling.
The Rise Credit would expand eligibility of the Earned Income Tax Credit to include those typically left out‚Äîstudents, caregivers, ; most people without kids‚Äîgiving households a cost-of-living refund of up to $8,000.
The cost of living is rising and families and individuals are struggling under current tax codes. The solution is simple‚Äîgive them a refund. That's what the Rise Credit will do. 
We have a leader in the White House who chooses who to protect ; support based on racism ; bigotry. That's not leadership at all. That's playground politics. We need a president who will represent all of our country's people. And we won't accept anything less. 
 Next time on  we visit Newark to ball with presidential candidate there, Thursday 11/10c‚Ä¶

The Trump administration posted an unsearchable pdf of the Mueller report so it would be harder for you to read.We made it easier. Here‚Äôs a searchable version: 
The American people deserve the truth.Not spin from a Trump appointee.Release Mueller's full report now.
Think about it this way: Trump's transgender military ban is crushing careers, taking food off of families' tables, and now it's barring this student from receiving an education. Oh. And it's bigoted. 
It's about time.
Thank you, for joining our campaign! 
 
So great to be back in the city that my parents called home for over twenty years. Thank you for welcoming me back, Atlanta! And special thanks to the student leaders and activists who hosted me for a necessary discussion on voting rights and reproductive justice. 
Voting rights are still under assault. We‚Äôve watched as:‚ÄîVoters were purged from rolls‚ÄîVoter ID laws targeted people of color‚ÄîElections were stolenWe need policy to preserve our right to vote. And it‚Äôs a shame we‚Äôre still fighting the same struggle of past generations. 
College costs have increased 8 times faster than wages since the 1980s. Rents are rapidly increasing. The cost of living overall is rising‚Äîthe fastest rate in 10 years. People quite literally can't afford to live in America ; we can't wait for a solution.  
It should make us all pause that we have a tax system that doesn't benefit the majority of hard-working people in this country. The Rise Credit is a common sense approach‚Äîlowering annual tax bills and expanding eligibility for tax credits will leave families with more money. 
I'll see you soon, Georgia. If you haven't already, RSVP here to attend the Justice For All Atlanta event:  
The current administration is trying to push their prejudice as policy. They've thrown children into cages, incited Islamophobia, ; banned some of our bravest Americans from fighting for this country. There's nothing courageous about this leadership. It's cowardly. 
Sometimes you just need a karaoke break.
We face big challenges as a nation‚Äîwe need to make health care more affordable for all, fix our crumbling infrastructure ; confront the threat of climate change. Grateful for the opportunity to meet with folks in Carroll, Iowa today to talk about how we‚Äôre going to do it. 
Give a warm welcome to our Iowa team and follow along for updates on the ground

Day 2 of the Justice For All Tour! Kicked off the morning answering some incredible questions from Sergeant Bluff High School students about everything from women‚Äôs rights to the student debt crisis. Students are engaged and ready to vote. Let's listen to them! 
Our tax system is gutting Americans. People are trying to make ends meet ; then spending hundreds of dollars on for-profit filing services that aren‚Äôt easy to access. This is more than a dollars ; cents issue, it's about equity ; quality of life.   
Jackie Robinson really did change the game when he broke color barrier 72 years ago today. He's an example of how generations of Americans refused to wait for justice‚Äîthey made it happen. Thank you for showing us that spirit of tenacity. Progress must be demanded. 
Grateful for such a warm welcome in Sioux City as we kicked off the first stop on our Justice for All tour‚Äîthank you to everyone who joined us this evening! 
The cost of living is high ; people are living paycheck-to-paycheck. So it makes no sense that those who make the most often end up paying the least in taxes. The Rise Credit benefits more than half of all Americans, ensuring we don't leave families behind. 
Strengthening the economy depends on our ability to strengthen American families. This is how we make that happen:
Iowa, I'm on my way! Thrilled to kick off my Justice For All Tour here and excited to meet with you to discuss how we can create a country where justice isn't an unattainable dream, but the standard for all Americans and their families.
We Won't Wait. 
I hope you'll join our movement:  
 Sen. Cory Booker formally joins presidential race with an echo of Martin Luther King Jr.: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt wait.‚Äù 
 Senator Cory Booker, drawing on themes from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs ‚ÄúLetter From a Birmingham Jail,‚Äù pitched his‚Ä¶
"Justice too long delayed is justice denied." ‚ÄîDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Trump‚Äôs recent attacks on are unacceptable‚Äîthis is the same language that gives extremists license to carry out violence against our Muslim brothers and sisters. 
Generations of Americans have shown us what was possible when they refused to wait for progress. Now it‚Äôs our turn. And we have work to do. 
We can‚Äôt wait for change. None of us can. If you agree, chip in to our campaign  
My heart is full. Thank you, Newark. 
Thanks for coming!

 Well done, my friend, An absolutely incredible campaign kickoff!   
Together, we will run at the tough challenges.Together, we will do the things that other people say are impossible.Together, we will fulfill our pledge to be a nation of liberty and justice for all.Together, we will win.And together, we will rise.  
America we know our history‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is perpetual testimony to impatient, demanding, unrelenting people who in every generation stand up for justice. 
We can‚Äôt afford a politics of division that sacrifices progress for purity. Our first priority must be to make people‚Äôs lives better. Now. 
Veterans deserve everything they have fought so bravely for‚Äî‚Äähealth care, education and good-paying jobs. 
We can‚Äôt have social justice or economic justice if we don‚Äôt have environmental justice.  
We won‚Äôt wait:- for criminal justice reform- for the legalization of marijuana at a federal level- for more thoughts and prayers for the communities that have been shattered by gun violence.We won‚Äôt wait.
We can‚Äôt wait:‚Äîwhen this administration is throwing children into cages‚Äîwhen brave transgender Americans are prevented from serving the country they love‚Äîwhen people who work two or three jobs still can‚Äôt pay the billsWe can‚Äôt wait.
The only way to overcome tough challenges is by extending grace, finding common ground, and working together. 
We are impatient for justice‚Äîand that impatience comes from the most demanding of values. It comes from love. 
Cory‚Äôs about to share his vision of how we can unite to build a more fair, just country. Tune in now! 
I‚Äôm honored to play a small part in this city‚Äôs history. It‚Äôs my daily reminder that the lines that divide us are nowhere near as strong as the ties that bind us. And that's why I'm betting on strong, courageous love in our fight to obtain justice for all: 
We refused to wait‚Äîwe did it together. When I say love will win in 2020, I‚Äôm speaking from experience. I've seen it in action in a city with serious challenges and a lot of naysayers. So I know it works.
Newark entered its largest period of economic growth since the 1960s. We built grocery stores in food deserts and businesses downtown. We made ambitious changes to city schools and created parks.
And with this in mind, I was able to become a part of the community of activists already urgently working to change their circumstances and transform our city. And together, we achieved a lot.
‚ÄúThe world you see outside of you is a reflection of what you have inside of you,‚Äù she would say. If you only see darkness, that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre going to see cities, like Newark, that have faced economic insecurity, gun violence, corruption, failing education...
Ms. Jones had reason to fall into the seduction of despair‚Äîher son was fatally shot in our lobby‚Äîbut she didn't. She taught me that Newark didn‚Äôt need saving from our perceived destruction. It was the rest of the nation that needed help to see the goodness of this community.
When I moved here 20+ years ago, this city quickly humbled me. I met a woman named Virginia Jones, the tenant president in the projects where I lived ; learned to see the promise of Newark amidst the very real pain.
Today we're hosting our Hometown Kickoff in Newark. This means a lot to me‚Äîit's a testament to how far we've come as a city and a model for how far we can go as a country. 
Thank them for their enthusiasm‚Ä¶and the support!

Tomorrow is the day. I'm officially kicking off the Justice for All tour in Newark, New Jersey and I want you to join me. Thanks for having me on this morning to talk about my city and my vision for America  
Ohio is the 3rd state this year that moved to ban abortions at six weeks. These bills are unconstitutional, but states are playing a long game: A possible Roe v. Wade repeal could trigger them into effect. We won't accept this attack on women's rights.

You're right to bring up Medicare for All, and I've been clear about the need for accessible health care in our nation. But this is a fact: Black women are four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. That needs to be addressed. 
The FCC rolled back net neutrality rules last year, allowing providers to throttle internet speeds to benefit corporations at the expense of the rest of us. Americans overwhelmingly support net neutrality. Glad to see the House pass this important bill. 
The anniversary of the Fair Housing Act is a reminder that equal housing access is a basic right. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve fought so hard in my career to protect tenants‚Äô rights. Today, the work continues. The American Dream means nothing if we don‚Äôt all have a chance to achieve it. 
You know that moment you read about a historical event and wonder, wow, that must've been cool to experience?That moment is now. Congratulations Katie!

There's a lot of talk about the legalization of marijuana. It‚Äôs about time. But there‚Äôs not nearly enough talk about restorative justice to lift minority communities gutted by the war on drugs. 
Looking forward to watching, Everyone else, make sure to tune in! 
We need to invest in the resource that is the genius of our children. That means prenatal care that doesn‚Äôt start in the emergency room, universal Pre-K, and making sure they don‚Äôt inherit trillions in debt. 
We must deal with rising wealth inequality, and invest in ideas that can help give every child born in this country a fair shot at achieving the American Dream. 
Don't do this. 
Educators at every level of our education system deserve better. I support the Rutgers AAUP-AFT in this fight for equality ; dignity. Rutgers faculty are on the front lines every day for their students‚Äîwe should all be united in the movement to support them.
This is personal: I‚Äôve witnessed the horrors of gun violence in my city firsthand. I know the names and faces. I'm sick of attending funerals. We have to act now. 
I‚Äôve been unapologetic in my belief that this can‚Äôt just be about acknowledging the past. It needs to be about actually confronting racist policy that persists right now in the present. Because if we don‚Äôt, we cannot guarantee that our future will be any different than our past. 
Thank you Jon, we're so excited to have your support! If you're in New Hampshire and also want to join the team, text NH to 40203. 
 Join Cory Booker next Saturday in Newark for a kick-off event and in Jersey City for a post-party event!
We need to close the wealth gap and give every child born in the US a fair shot at the American Dream‚Äîmy baby bonds proposal is a clear path forward to making that happen. 
I am proud to introduce legislation that will finally address many of our country's policies‚Äîrooted in a history of slavery and white supremacy‚Äîthat continue to erode Black communities, perpetuate racism and implicit bias, and widen the racial wealth gap.
We're in this together.  
We can‚Äôt let this lull us into a false sense of complacency‚Äîwe still have kids locked up in cages, and the cruelty won‚Äôt end as long as Trump is in the White House. My Judiciary Committee colleagues and I will continue the fight. 
The best way to win this election is not to fight it on Donald Trump's terms. Not to show the worst of who we are. We can't beat hate with hate. Londonderry, NH, thank you for giving me the time to discuss real solutions to lift up our country. 
There are still more than 20 million people living without access to affordable health care who could go bankrupt because of unexpected medical bills. In the wealthiest country in the world, every person should have access to quality and affordable health care.

Two things:- Seeking asylum is a legal right- Language like this has historically been used to dehumanize, enslave, commit genocide, and carry out acts of violence around the world and across history. We won't stand for it. 
Real economic justice can‚Äôt be color-blind; the policies that got us here weren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not enough to atone for the past if we‚Äôre not confronting the bias of the present. 
In a country as wealthy as the United States of America, it‚Äôs a shame many families don‚Äôt have an opportunity to achieve upward mobility. We can no longer accept racial and economic disparity as a normal function of our society.  
We‚Äôve talked about racial and economic disparities in this country long enough. It‚Äôs time for real action. Watch live: 
You don't have to live in Newark to attend the kickoff for our campaign's national Justice for All Tour!

On this day 51 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Today, we must radically embrace his legacy the same way he radically pushed this country to embrace justice. We must dream again.

It looks like the NRA heard us loud and clear. But its positions are tired, and the movement to take it down will not be discouraged. 
I know it feels like it‚Äôs time to worry in this country. But worrying didn‚Äôt get us civil rights, women‚Äôs rights, or workers' rights. Organizing, fighting together, and standing together did. So, let's get to it. 
In a city that serves as the hometown for many Black American politicians who have made history, there is another political first. Congrats on becoming Chicago's first Black woman mayor and good luck as you embark on this historic journey. 
LGBTQ people are 4.5%+ of the US population but only 0.1% of all officeholders identify as LGBTQ. For National  Day let‚Äôs work on fixing this severe under-representation ; encourage our LGBTQ friends, family ; community leaders to run for office:

My favorite part of any town hall is meeting the folks who stick around to say hi! 
There are 3 million+ Americans in the "place" called Puerto Rico. The truth? They are fellow citizens and they deserve to be acknowledged and protected as such. The only "mess" in this national emergency is the refusal to act honestly and accordingly. 
Women earn 79¬¢ for every $1 that men earn‚Äîand the gap's even wider for black and Latina women. This undermines the potential of working women and it's an economic crisis for our country. It's time for equal pay for women's work. 
Wealth inequality is at its highest point in decades, hurting kids‚Äô ability to get a fair shot. By funding a savings account for every child born in America, we could help solve that problem.Read more about our Baby Bonds plan:

Our broken criminal justice system is a cancer on the soul of our nation that preys upon our most marginalized populations.

And it‚Äôs not enough to just legalize marijuana, we should help those with records for use and possession convictions, and allow people currently in prison for marijuana-related crimes to petition for resentencing, which is why my legislation includes expungement provisions.
Black people are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white peers even though they use marijuana at similar rates. If we truly want to be a fair and just nation we need to correct for this disparate treatment of enforcement practices.
The Marijuana Justice Act doesn‚Äôt just end the federal prohibition on marijuana‚Äîit also incentivizes states to change their marijuana laws if those laws are being enforced in a way that disproportionately impacts people of color and the poor.
The failed War on Drugs has really been a war on people‚Äîdisproportionately criminalizing poor people, people of color ; people with mental illness. I‚Äôm reintroducing the  Act to begin reversing our failed federal drug policies. Join us: 
Today we saw a big victory in the House but we must keep pushing for commonsense gun safety legislation like universal background checks.

It's unacceptable that 1 in 5 Americans can‚Äôt afford their medication due to skyrocketing costs. We need a comprehensive approach to lowering drug prices that includes leveraging Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices and enforcing consequences for unjust price gouging.

‚ÄúA living wage is an antidepressant. It is a sleep aid. A diet. A stress reliever. It is a contraceptive, preventing teenage pregnancy. It prevents premature death. It shields children from neglect.‚Äù  is why we must  
Thank you for your support, From one former mayor to another, I'm so grateful to have you on our team. 
Relieved to hear Jorge Ramos and his team are safe. Detaining journalists for doing their jobs is undemocratic and unacceptable. 
Cool enough, debatable; talented enough, doubtful. 
The  is about economic justice and ensuring every working American has a job that pays a living wage. Proud that New Jersey is helping lead this effort becoming the 4th state to raise our minimum wage to $15 an hour earlier this month. 
Our health care system is clearly broken‚ÄîAmericans should not have to make the drastic choice between seeking medical care or considering whether that care will cost too much or result in personal bankruptcy. This is one of the many reasons why we should adopt Medicare for all.
I agree, Dan - the only way we‚Äôre going to stop this blatant voter suppression is by working together to fight it.Friends, chip in now to help Dan in his special election and make sure all voters‚Äô voices are heard:

I‚Äôve always believed that words have power. This type of callous language is typical of the need commonsense gun safety legislation. 
It‚Äôs not enough to just legalize marijuana at the federal level‚Äîwe should also expunge records of those who have served their time, and reinvest in communities hardest hit by the failed War on Drugs‚Äîwhich has really been a war on people.
We spend trillions of dollars to put the best fighting force on the field abroad, but when those men and women come home‚Äîoften their bodies broken and with invisible scars‚Äîwe suddenly don't have the resources or will to give them what they deserve. That‚Äôs wrong and must change. 
Today we remember and celebrate the renowned civil rights activist, author, co-founder of the and one of the most important voices of the 20th century, W.E.B. Du Bois, who was born on this day in 1868.  
The US is the only industrialized nation to not guarantee paid family leave. Only a handful of states including New Jersey have paid family leave laws‚Äîgrateful to for continuing our state‚Äôs leadership on this issue.

Inspired by all of the Granite Staters who took time out of their holiday weekend to pack into homes and standing-room only crowds to ask substantive questions about issues that affect us all -- from the opioid crisis to affordable health care and more. 
Paid family leave is an investment in the strength of our families. I‚Äôm proud to see New Jersey leading on this issue, and will continue to fight for federal legislation guaranteeing paid family leave for all American families. 
The water crisis in Flint is not an anomaly‚Äîthere are hundreds of jurisdictions across our country where our kids have higher elevated blood lead levels. We need to make major infrastructure investments in our communities to ensure clean air and water. 
We must close the wealth gap that‚Äôs undermining equal opportunity in our country. My baby bonds bill will help level the playing field by creating a savings account for every US child‚Äîto invest in themselves through things like paying for higher education. 
During the greatest moments of our country‚Äôs history, people came together to solve what seemed like impossible problems. I‚Äôm building a campaign to take on our toughest challenges and build a more fair and just nation for everyone‚ÄîI hope you‚Äôll join me. 
My mother took care of my father when he was ill with Parkinson‚Äôs onset dementia. We have to do a better job of tackling the problems associated with neurological diseases‚Äîbetter research, better health care, better support for caregivers.

My heart is with the loved ones of the victims of the horrific shooting in Aurora, Illinois that has left 5 people dead and more injured. But we know our thoughts and prayers are not enough. Congress must take action to prevent gun violence. 
Across this country people are surrendering to despair and cynicism about our ability to solve our problems. I‚Äôm running for president because I know when we unite around a common purpose we can change that. 
In South Carolina last weekend I was reminded that even in our darkest moments of despair, we can never give up hope. We can never give up faith. 
For over a century, Congress has failed 200 times to pass legislation recognizing lynching for what it is‚Äîa bias-motivated act of terror. Our bill, just unanimously passed in the Senate, would finally make lynching a federal crime. The House must now act. 
New Hampshire! Looking forward to spending a long weekend in your beautiful state‚Äîmy first trip to the Granite State as a presidential candidate. Hope to see you there. 
In an atmosphere of cynicism often found in Washington, we‚Äôve found ways to find common ground and get things done that make our country more fair and just‚Äîincluding signing into law our bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that‚Äôs already changing lives across this country. 
Trump‚Äôs inability to follow through on a campaign promise is not a national emergency. Let‚Äôs not forget those still struggling to rebuild their lives after this administration failed to respond effectively to real emergencies in places like Puerto Rico. 
The Senate just unanimously passed our bill to make lynching a federal crime. This bill acknowledges the wrongs in our history and honors the memories of those brutally killed. Making this law is the right thing to do‚ÄîI hope the House will move quickly to pass.
One year ago, the  community lost 17 lives in a heinous act of gun violence.  1,200 kids in America have been killed by guns. It‚Äôs long past time we unite in common purpose and pass common sense gun safety legislation to prevent more tragedy.
We have a system of mass incarceration that feeds upon the poor, the mentally ill, the addicted, and disproportionately on communities of color. Mr. Barr has shown an unwillingness to call out this broken system. For this reason and more I cannot support his nomination. 
No corporations. No federal lobbyists. We're going to win this campaign -- together. Chip in today:

Today, nearly 1 in 3 American families have zero to negative wealth, and the wealth gap is growing. My bill would create a savings account for every American child to invest in themselves through things like buying a home or paying for higher education.

I was honored to have my mom with me yesterday from the very moment I announced my run for president. This is a campaign that will live up to my mom‚Äôs words and make her proud. I hope you‚Äôll join us on this journey:  
People at a federal prison in Brooklyn are enduring unbearable, freezing conditions after going without heat and power for days ‚Äî this is outrageous and inhumane. We need answers. 
These images arouse centuries of anger, anguish, and racist violence and they‚Äôve eroded all confidence in Gov. Northam‚Äôs ability to lead. We should expect more from our elected officials. He should resign.
Today on the anniversary of the Greensboro sit-in we remember the struggle and sacrifice of the Greensboro Four‚Äîwhat happens when a group of people come together to sit in, and to stand up, for each other and our country. We still have work to do.  
Lo que nos une es mucho m√°s de lo que nos divide. Cuando nos unimos y trabajamos juntos - progresamos juntos.
My Aunt Alma is the incredible matriarch of our Iowa family - she means business! 
Huge smile! Kirsten, I am glad we are both in. As I told folks today on The View:  You are my sister. There may be some sibling rivalry but we will always be family. 
Deeply grateful for you and this tweet my brother. Your integrity, strong sense of justice, and righteous and relentless activism is light in our nation. 
I‚Äôm not in this race to tear people down. I‚Äôm in it to build people up and bring people together to make progressive change and build a country that's more fair and more just. 
I know that together, we can‚Ä¶ we will, rise.I hope you‚Äôll join me. 
Despite our divisions, the hatred of some, and the economic hardship of many, together we will ensure that our generation and generations to come will achieve things others say can‚Äôt be done.
When I went down to Washington, people told me it was a place where you couldn‚Äôt make change happen, but I‚Äôve been able to pass laws that start to turn the tide against mass incarceration and spark historic investment in vulnerable communities.
When I moved to Newark to protect tenants from slumlords, people told us we couldn't win. Well, we beat them. When I was mayor, we showed the doubters that impossible things could still happen in our city.
I've spent my entire career running toward big challenges others had given up on, bringing people together to do things that we were told were impossible. That's what our country needs right now.
People feel left out. They worry that the lines that divide us right now are stronger than the ties that bind us. I‚Äôm running to change that.In America, we have a common pain, common challenges. But what we're lacking is a sense of common purpose.
The promise of our country, that this is a country that works for everyone, is hanging in the balance. When we should be coming together to take on our biggest challenges, there are forces at work trying to split us apart.
I want to take a couple minutes and share a few thoughts about why I‚Äôm running for president:
Thanks for the pic. I miss my dad. He died days before I was elected to The Senate. He had wise words that kept me grounded. When I graduated Law School: "Boy u got more degrees than the month of July but you ain't hot, life's about the service you give not the degrees you get." 
He told me when I was growing up that I was his "stunt double."Shout out to for not being the only presidential candidate that has a doppelg√§nger. 
So grateful for your kind feedback. Thank you. 
Michael this really moves me. Thank you for joining our team. We will work together to honor your Paw Paw and all of our ancestors who lived so that we could have a better, more just life. 
So grateful for my family in Iowa who gathered to watch me launch my campaign.My grandmother was born and raised in Des Moines and I owe that community and the church she grew up in so much.  
We‚Äôre building this campaign together the right way: I won't take a single dollar from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists.Our campaign will be funded by real people -- like YOU!Chip in now to join our team: 
My dad used to say to me: ‚ÄúBoy, don‚Äôt forget where you came from and the people who sacrificed to get you to where you are.‚Äù 
My soul belongs to God. I fear no man. And I believe that anyone's individual capacity to denigrate will never be as strong as our collective power to elevate. 
Thank you for this commitment. 
That is not the call. The call is to unite with people around our shared values and ideals. Too many of us focus on the hate of the some and not the limitless potential strength of the active many.I am more worried about the silent disengaged many than the hateful active few. 
Huge gratitude for your support. This means so much to me and my family. Onward! 
Last thing I will ever do is insult you. I sincerely wish you and your family the best. May both you and I get better at extending grace even when we disagree and at being tough without being mean. All the best.
