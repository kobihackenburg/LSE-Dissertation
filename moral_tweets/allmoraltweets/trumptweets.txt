Thank you Hilton Head, South Carolina!   
I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  on television lately, and he was terrific hosting
Joe McQuaid  is desperately trying to sell the It's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much.
The dying newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!
"" Good morning, Mr. Trump. You're so AWESOME.  
"" Trump tops Dem candidates on Google before Dem debate

Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting
   You were great on last night. Thanks for the nice words. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
THANK YOU Council Bluffs, Iowa! The silent majority, is silent no more!   
Joe McQuaid  of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical.
The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.
Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid  of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!
I hope does better for Rubio than he did at the  hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans , America!
We need a real President! 
Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! 
So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million , done. Run country my way!
My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

Thank you!   
Thank you to a  supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: 
Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double , triple them, a disaster!
Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!
The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!
"" We need a real President to get things done, and that's why we want you!""  Thank you."
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC
 blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!
R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!
It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!
"" He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him."
"" My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy.
"" Face it, Trey Gowdy failed miserably on Benghazi. He allowed it to drag out and in the end, let Hillary get away with murder."
"" andreajmarkley: Rubio finally gets an endorsement ‚Äì from  loser Gowdy    via dailyne"
I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!
Thank you!  
Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!
"" If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,Obamacare is a failure since so expensive"
A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!
  Story:  
Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!
The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it
The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.
 is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!
 just announced that TRUMP was  story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!
"" Thank u Mr. Trump, I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States  So nice!"
""  You know what's making my Christmas Great, Family/food/friends,YOU! I HAVE MY TRUMP SHI ON W/HOPE IN MY HEA for America
""  Thank you for your tweet today on Christmas. Can't wait to see you as President, Mr. Trump. You are awesome.
"" I'm reading  Best book ever. Thank you!"
"When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say ""we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?"" Never!"
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!
Remember when failed candidate said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.
We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
  Great job on today. Very wise indeed!
 Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps will do better next year-but doubt it!
"" should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story""  True, a total distortion of the facts!"
I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 and very dishonest in not showing the new Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
Why isn't using the much newer Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPOATION RAIDS. It's about time!
Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past in the new Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
In the ridiculous ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
Poor spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!
"" Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail"
A great Christmas movie , perfect   Story:  
"" why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal.
"" why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal.""  Good question!"
"Hillary said ""I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign."" I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity"
Merry Christmas , Happy Holidays!  
"Hillary, when you complain about ""a penchant for sexism,"" who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!"
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
Why does give so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
 treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out Poll. All negative!
The which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on  today did a nasty cartoon attacking kids. Bad
The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!  
The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.
  
Thank you America! Together- we will  
Big news just out - NEW POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10
We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!
  
Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!
"For those on TV defending my use of the word ""schlonged,"" bc  is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest 
"NPR's said ""schlonged"" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: ""That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls."" 
"Once again,  is dishonest. ""Schlonged"" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got ""schlonged"" that meant beaten badly."
Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!
Watching and consider to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!
Women defy media narrative, love Trump at packed Michigan rally.VIDEO:  
""  The Donald should've been named Man of the Year. He dominates the polls, news, talk shows , social media. MAGA!
"" Well I'm at 42% and your at 3% .You know Jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage.  Classic
 opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent.
Why doesn't in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?
Will in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?
 just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!
Weak and low energy whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.

John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete , total dud!
John Kasich fell right into President Obama‚Äôs trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
Doesn‚Äôt help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he‚Äôs almost last.
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy‚Äîhe came in dead last!
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don‚Äôt want to waste my money.
John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign , debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!

New Zogby poll‚Äî highly respected‚Äî but the media won‚Äôt report it because it gives me an even bigger lead!     
"" touts CNN polls instead of their own!! Of course, the NBC one shows him much higher. Trump corrects them!"

Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer! Pres.
I am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far.   Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad!
I have been leading big in all  polls, with two more today, and The NBC poll is more than double next,  at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.
There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!
I will be on at 10:30. will be releasing their new poll numbers. Based on the debate results, I should do well-who knows?

Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great
If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!

Wow,  just wrote the definitive piece on what I said about John McCain 
One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians. I will fix VA quickly.
Why would anybody listen to He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain!
Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, for taking a tough , bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry.
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans.....
I will make this right for our great Vets!
All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything.
....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes!
In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!
New York, we will make America great again! 
Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter:
Thank you!  
Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? 
This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. 
Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? 
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
How come the , show the new Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
Wow, has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN , MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!

"Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a ""hell hole"" and a mess and the failing wrote a critical article. I was so right!"
These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I‚Äôm the only one that was right from the beginning, , now Lyin‚Äô Ted , others are copying me.
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She‚Äôs been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can‚Äôt blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas‚Äî just another dishonest politician.
Thank you, Arizona!   
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!
Thank you, Arizona!   
Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich , Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
"Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who ""choked"" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!"
Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said- NO! 
Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
 got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me.
Senator made horrible statements about ‚Äì and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
Join us in Salt Lake City, Utah- tonight! 
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. 
Highly overrated , crazy is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday. 
Please explain to the dummies at the  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them!
 is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!
" Editorial says ""Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692""-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize"
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
Crazy is now complaining that  did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
Great news that has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating
Crazy supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!
Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!

 I can skate here ONLY b/c fixed this rink after NYC gov‚Äôt spent $13M, but FAILED! Good for Trump! 
I am making a big speech the night of the debate, but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!
Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support!
In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida , I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
Yesterday was amazing‚Äî5 victories.  Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruzhad zero. Things are going very well!
Is this what we want for a President? 
  Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side!

"I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will ""sing"" again."
In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.
 Mathematically it is statistically impossible for Kasich to get to 1237 - he would need 112% of the remaining delegates to b...

Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter,   
Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!

Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- , should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.

Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!
Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!
Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!
Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!
Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!
I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!
"" yup 200 Polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not Trump
"" Cruz talks about Hillary all the time because he knows he can't beat you ! Trump will win Texas !
"" trump won the debate. Disgusting Rubio said ""peed"" - is he still in junior high school.
""  Marco Cruz and Ted Rubio (easy to get the two politicians confused) looked like desperate, panicked DC insiders tonight
"" ""that's because you've never hired anyone to do work before"" favorite line from tonights debate.
"" Tonight you proved to America you are the real deal. You took fire from all sides, stayed composed, returned fire and WON!"
"" he won almost all polls and Mark Halperin gave him an A-"
"" Vote Early in the   will  
""  Also, all the things Rubio,Cruz were using for hits, just petty. Trump, clearly the only one w/all the skills.
Big day in Texas tomorrow! Having a rally in Fort Worth. Tremendous crowd. Will be exciting!  
All the online polls have me winning the debate. I really enjoyed the evening. Not easy, but good. 
  
Thank you!  Polls  
  
Thank you! WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!
Great new poll. Thank you Texas!

  Chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down!
When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem!
"Why would Texans vote for ""liar"" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently"
When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win!
"" Oh great is doing a on like losing the presidency wasn't enough  He's a fool"
Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy
The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out, I will pick up more.  Sad but true

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.
Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.
Thank you for your endorsement   Video:

Jeb used Eminent Domain , took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue , never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!
Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists , special interests - the bosses!

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote.  
I will be interviewed on at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
"And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and ""choice"" - a total lie!"
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
Great job on tonight  begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy!
On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!

We launched a new series of  videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch:  
A great morning with everyone Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now.   
Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. 
Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us  
Thank you for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH , IA radio ad: 
"" great on too""  Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate!"
I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.
Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!
Big announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally!   
Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!
In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!
Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. 
Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about , demeaning? 
Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, , $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite
Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you!  
Greatly dishonest of to file a financial disclosure form , not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
When will give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. 
Great new numbers. Thank you!   
Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
"Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a ""natural born Canadian,"" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?"
Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
"Ted Cruz said he ""didn't know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable"
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.
 is a total clown. Has zero credibility!  
 please explain to the very dumb and failing that I supported John McCain big league in 2008, not Obama!
Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!
  Thank you Geraldo for your nice words on tonight. You are a true champion! Thank - great guy!

Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the  media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.
Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.
WSJ/NBC Poll: Donald Trump Widens His Lead in Republican Presidential Race.

"" Thousands packed into the Pensacola Bay Center to see Donald Trump tonight...   A fantastic evening!"
Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.
"" Standing with as he defends our sailors and military and Americans in the USA 
"" There isn't anything Donald Trump says that I don't agree with. Go Trump!
" ""Trump's appeal to evangelicals is real""   
United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!
Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does put him on?
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures , images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!
Why does , waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?
 unbelievable job on  with That was better than I could do! 
THANK YOU!  
THANK YOU, IOWA! Highly respected poll just released.   
 REUTERS ROLLING:  TRUMP 39%, CRUZ 14.5%, BUSH 10.6%, CARSON 9.6%, RUBIO 6.7%... MORE... 
Thank you! 
My nomination would increase voter turnout.   
Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!
""  THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT AMERICAS FUTURE, VOTE TRUMP
Thank you for your support last night, Iowa!      
Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!
Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!
Just found out that is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.
The  speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!
The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. 
New CBS poll. 
Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you!   
Such a serious problem for Ted , the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 
On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!
THANK YOU!  
The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!
 horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility. Don't blame Mitt! Now Stevens can't get a job!

So professional of news to throw out the failing newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!

Why does w/ allow a hater , racist like to waste good airtime? can do much better than him!
Thank you to our law enforcement officers!   
Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn‚Äôt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can‚Äôt win.
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. 
Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...
Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!
In the just out Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!

Love seeing union , non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their  leaders can‚Äôt compete!
I hope all workers demand that their reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don‚Äôt let them sell you out!
Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
 was one of the worst performing stocks on the S,P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.
The failing newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!
Do you believe that in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received:

By the way, Hillary , the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al-Shabaab terror video. 
The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner , if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!
Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.

Heading to Biloxi, Mississippi. Massive crowds expected. Thank you for your support!  
Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!
Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
" is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!"
