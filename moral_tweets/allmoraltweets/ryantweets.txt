This is mind-boggling to read in light of the Turkey invasion. I attended Catholic School for 13 years and don’t remember a single word or commandment about abandoning innocent people so a despot could annihilate them. 
I’m embarrassed for our country today. We should all pray for the Kurdish people. 
Trump abandoned deals w/ business partners, union workers, small businesses, and even students at Trump University. Now many innocent people will die because of this decision. A rugged group of fighters who stood with the US through think and thin. 
A deal is a deal. The Kurds fought for us — helped us to end the threat of ISIS — and now we cut them loose? No wonder Trump is losing support from all sides. 
Absolutely disgusting. It goes to show that the mega-rich have gobbled up more ; more of the wealth in our country over the last 30 years. We need a  economy that emphasizes an American Dream that works for the Working Class. 
Drip. Drip. Drip.

I’m on fire at the 911!!! Pastor T and her church have inspired me. Grateful for all the support we are getting in South Carolina. 
Who benefits from this economic "boom"? Not the Working Class.When corporations got a tax cut from the Trump admin, did they reinvest in workers? No. They used it on stock buybacks to line their own pockets.We need a  economic policy to benefit working families. 
We've got to embrace new technologies—artificial intelligence ; additive manufacturing—and we've got to dominate them. We've got to get them into our older industries. We've got to ramp up productivity, and then we’ve got to cut the worker in on the deal. 
Yes! Union Strong!! 💪 
Standing union strong on the picket line with my sisters ; brothers in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. There is power in a union -- and these folks are showing just where that power comes from: the people.   
Just because you do crimes in public doesn’t mean they stop being crimes. 
The opportunity to join a union is the best way to raise wages, improve working conditions, and create family-sustaining jobs. That’s why I’m standing with ; Rockingham County Rehabilitation and Nursing Center employees in their fight for a union.  
Poverty wages hurt families, communities, and our whole economy. That’s why I’m supporting and the employees of Rockingham County Rehabilitation and Nursing as they gear up for their union election today.   
What day is it? It's the day Rockingham County Rehabilitation and Nursing Center employees vote on unionization with   
I love CASEL ; The work they do is the future of healing our kids and preparing them to do the diligent work of transforming our country.   
Thank you to former SC Rep. Fletcher Smith for your endorsement video. He's a big name and big leader in South Carolina. We're so proud to have his support and endorsement. Let’s win in SC!  
Here’s hoping for a speedy recovery for my friend, Andrea, the family and I are sending our support and prayers his way. I look forward to seeing him back on the trail soon.

 “The President way over stepped his bounds and I think he needs to be impeached,” - Ohio Congressman and 2020…
Funny how the more people hear about this mobster of a President, the more they think he's a mobster who's not suited to be President.Sunshine really is the best disinfectant. 
I don’t wanna get too deep, but when people like Trump feel threatened they respond by trying to take their pain out on others. I’m afraid we'll be seeing a lot of moves like this in the coming weeks. It's going to be a rough ride. Let’s hang together. 
ICYMI – Full text of the whistleblower’s complaint here: 
I can’t believe my Republican colleagues are going to ignore this. Would they if our President was an Democrat? 
I just read the Whistleblower’s report. It’s as straightforward as can be. The President ; Guiliani were shaking down the President of Ukraine—withholding needed defensive support—until they got dirt on Joe Biden. This is third-rate, banana republic behavior.
Who’s gonna tell him? 
Donald Trump showed us again that his true colors are more like a mob boss than a president. It’s time to impeach. 
And any Republican who wants to salvage some of the last vestiges of what used to be a noble and important political party in America should speak up for impeachment now before there isn’t a Republican Party at all.
This President's behavior is illegal and I once again call on Congress to impeach him—immediately. Any right-minded American should support this.
This President has no regard for any of the high standards that we expect from our Presidents. It disgusts me to think he sits in the same chair as Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.Donald Trump is a classless, amoral gutter dweller.
Vice President Biden is a man who, regardless of your politics, has served this country in a noble way for over forty years. This is more than we can say for President Bone Spurs and the many dumpster fires he has left behind in his political and business careers.
Like many Americans I am appalled at the behavior of President Trump. He is disgraceful in his conduct to try to extort foreign powers to try to dirty up Vice President Biden.

We know how much relied on her for advice ; counsel throughout his life ; political career. Emily’s legacy of activism, leadership, ; education lives within their three children—Mignon, Jennifer ; Angela. She‘ll be missed by South Carolina ; her Congressional family.
My wife Andrea ; I extend our deepest sympathies to the Clyburn family on the passing of Dr. Emily England Clyburn. She was a powerful force not only in the Clyburn household but also throughout South Carolina.
This is why the strike is important—and why investments in the future economy, research, education, skills and our people’s health is vital—so this never happens again to *any* community in the United States. That’s why I’m running for President.

This is some bullshit.Corporations like GM won’t be happy until American workers are treated as poorly as the workers in China. 
Before I leave Toledo, wanted to relay a message from our sisters ; brothers on the picket lines. GM has got so-called “temp” workers, who’ve been on the line for 4-5 years and making only half what the full-time workers make. It’s time to get every worker the same respect.

We need to make things in the United States again. And we need union labor to make those things to the high standards we expect in our country. With a  economy, workers will have a much greater say in how things are run in the workplace.  
cc:   
Before greedy investment bankers crashed our economy into the Great Recession, blue-collar workers could count on a job at a place like the Lordstown GM plant for a living wage to support a family.$15 is not enough—we contracts ; policies that put workers first. 
When a group of workers lose their jobs, it causes massive disruption in the whole community. Kids of these workers have to deal w/ either move to a new state ; school; or the trauma of a parent being laid off. Educators are often left to help pick up the pieces.  
That’s what workers are… They put their time in. You do everything right and then when you get home, you go coach Little League.    cc:
Closing the Lordstown GM plant — even if those members have the opportunity to transfer to other factories — would be a disaster for NE Ohio and for the families of those workers. These folks are more than cogs in a machine, they're members of a *community*.  
 Shout out to organized labor 
I stand in solidarity with the members in their negotiations. The award-winning, American-made vehicles built at GM are due to *their* hard work — work they deserve fair compensation for. 
Spiral — still got it.

Let us commemorate the heroes and their sacrifices — those who gave their lives on this day 18 years ago and those who have suffered and sacrificed since. First responders and public workers are at the heart of what makes this country great, especially as we remember them today.

Self-care is health care.75% of what children learn is from modeling. If we expect kids to pick up Social ; Emotional Leaning skills, we need to model good behavior, how to deal w/ conflict ; how to self regulate as parents, teachers ; mentors. We are all leaders.  
It's critical that we teach our kids to value Social and Emotional Learning. These skills are vital to their growth as people + their ability to learn in the classroom.But it's also important that the adults in their lives maintain their own restorative practices.  
This is phenomenal!!  Keep it going. It’s time to heal our country by healing ourselves.  And that starts by teaching our kids well.  
I’ve called for a climate debate time and time again and I’ve offered to host it in Youngstown. I’ll be participating in a forum with climate as a major piece with tomorrow. Here are the details:  
This is it!!!  Public/Private partnerships building wealth and creating jobs. This is a centerpiece to my agenda. Promote entrepreneurship, close skills gap, get private investment into forgotten communities. Great job 
I’ve been saying for a long time that this economy, supposedly at its best, is still not working for most Americans.  Now a looming recession means things will get worse. It’s time for us to build a new economy. Not bandaids to the broken system.

 Mission Accomplished. 
For Netanyahu to be a lapdog to Donald Trump is completely irresponsible. Rep Ilhan Omar and Rep Rashida Tlaib should be allowed in and the President shouldn't be targeting elected officials. 
The looming recession and downturn has the president coming unhinged.  Hate will not make things right. Let’s reject the Hater In Chief.

The state of anxiety in the United States today, and inaction is not acceptable. The president and Republicans ignore gun violence at their peril. 
Devastating. My prayers are with these officers, their families and the community in Philadelphia. 
This is appalling. Help restore dignity to this seat  
Seventy-five percent of our health care costs in the United States come from chronic diseases that are largely preventable. We must transform our health care system and build out a system that reverses chronic diseases that are costing us three-and-a-half-trillion dollars a year. 
Looks like the Trump Slump is starting in Germany. Supply side economics + erratic trade policies = Trump Slump
We don't talk enough about the increasing levels of stress and anxiety and the impact it has on our communities. We must remove the stigma of mental health and ensure people can access the care they need.

Nothing left to say. We need action. 
The Trump administration has erected yet another hurdle to LEGAL immigration. It's clear they aren't motivated by an adherence to law and order, but by intolerance and xenophobia. 
10 million electric vehicles are going to be made in the next 10 years. I want half of those built by American workers in the United States. My Chief Manufacturing Officer will ensure we have a long-term strategy to dominate the electric vehicle market. 
We've known this administration's cuts, understaffing and disregard for the federal prison system would come back to haunt us. Now Epstein gets off easy and the victims will not get the full justice they deserve. 
In the two years since white nationalists marched in Charlottesville we've seen this form of hate encouraged and emboldened by a president for his own political ends. There can be no place for this in our democracy. We must come together and begin to heal our country.

Gun violence has become a plague, destroying our country and robbing us of our peace. A lack of action is to be complicit.
These mass shootings in America have become the norm. Dayton, El Paso and Gilroy communities are reeling and we are responsible. We can’t continue to offer up the same condolences again and again with no action to protect our communities.

Join our grassroots movement to create real change in America:   
This is how we win the future: NEW and BETTER. A new and better economy that focuses on dominating new technologies. An education system that focuses on the trauma of our kids. And a healthcare system that focuses on prevention. This is how we fix our country.  
There was no conversation about our children or K-12 education. How can we talk about the future without talking about transforming our education system? We need to focus less on test scores ; more on healing our kids' trauma ; their social emotional wellbeing. 
We can't talk about climate change without talking about agriculture. We need to convert our industrial agriculture system over to a sustainable and regenerative agricultural system, that actually sequesters carbon into the soil.

It would provide grants and contracts to local governments to ensure that capital investment is dispersed throughout the country, not concentrated in a handful of states or homogenous groups.
The DCIA would be a division of the Commerce Dept. that would focus on expanding capital investment to communities and groups that have been underrepresented in capital investment dollars.

Thank you for everything you do to fight for workers and their families. 
 Agreed!
Unions for all industry sectors – healthcare, education, manufacturing, federal government, construction, aerospace, transportation, and more — are the foundation of our economy. We have to make doubling union membership in the United States a top priority. 
Completely agree. Each student needs 21st Century College and Career pathways to explore their own interest and follow their passions. We also need more makerspaces where students can creating projects and portfolios, rather than standardized tests to assess performance. 
We have to expand registered apprenticeship programs around the country, by increasing federal funding for these skills-based education programs.
Women make up 7.3% of those who complete an apprenticeship programs, around 16% are Hispanic or Latino ; 10.7% are African American. We know about 48% of job openings will be for middle-skill which are jobs that require education beyond high-school, but not a 4-year degree.
The average salary of an employee who finishes an apprenticeship program is $60K. We need to not only grow apprenticeships, but also increase the diversity of these programs. This means increasing opportunity for everyone – no matter their gender, race, ethnicity, or age.

The only path this president can see to reelection is division and hate.
Heart breaking for the Gilroy community. There’s no end to gun violence in our communities until we take action. 
Yes! is an exemplar of what every community school can be! 🙏🏽👊🏼 
We have to increase industrial investments to make our cities more walkable, build bike lanes and trails, renovate theaters, build municipal pools and playgrounds, create infrastructure to promote urban agriculture, construct river walks, and invest in affordable housing. 
Our farmers are hurting, facing broken promises ; bankruptcy. We MUST reinvigorate rural economies. We have to help farmers transition to regenerative agriculture, and pay them for ecosystem services including carbon sequestration. This will ALSO help combat climate change.
 How Mindfulness can help children 
We HAVE to address creating a fair and equal system of education in this country. Period. It’s a sin that in 2019 we have a system where some schools that are encouraging kids to exceed their own expectations, and some don’t even have the resources to fix leaks in the ceiling.
“I’m too emotional, said a 67-year-old woman who has worked for the company for four decades. She was among a group of women who prayed on the factory floor Friday morning. Others crowded around the last transmission to roll off the line — bound for a 2019 Chevrolet Impala.” 
As President, I will establish an office at the White House, headed by a U.S. Chief Manufacturing Officer, to develop and drive a national manufacturing strategy, set goals for production, increase advanced manufacturing, and troubleshoot manufacturing-related issues. 
We have to help workers left-behind by the changing economy from automation and globalization. My new industrial plan would make workers the priority and ensure more employment security.

 Chief Manufacturing Officer in Office of the President. Thank you for speaking about steps you will take to solve a problem…
Join me in making this industrial plan a reality.
I will establish the Distressed Community Investment Agency (DCIA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce. Through the DCIA, we will strengthen venture capital investment in distressed communities.
Our country must lead the world when it comes to the research ; development of new technologies. Currently, four states receive 80% of venture capital dollars, but there are innovators ; entrepreneurs throughout the country who are being overlooked.
As workers around the country respond to the changing economy from automation ; globalization, our federal government must step in to ease the transition and create a job assistance program for every American. I will make workers the priority and ensure more employment security.
This bank would be modeled after the banks we have seen throughout the world to leverage public and private dollars to finance infrastructure and transportation projects.
I will prioritize an infrastructure package that makes long-term investments in transportation projects in every community in this country. One of my first steps in pushing a long-term infrastructure package will be to create and fund a National Infrastructure Development Bank.
For far too long our country has lagged when it comes to fixing our country’s crumbling infrastructure, and investing in transportation projects for the 21st Century.
I will create a task force that prioritizes not only growing apprenticeships, but also increasing the diversity of these programs. This means creating opportunity for long-lasting careers for everyone in the workforce – no matter their gender, race, ethnicity, or age.
We also cannot ignore the major discrepancies when it comes to the number of women and people of color enrolled in apprenticeships programs throughout the country.
I will commit to expanding registered apprenticeship programs around the country. These programs, with unions leading the charge, are some of the best ways to ensure that men and women are prepared for the workforce and have the skills necessary to succeed.
Studies show that men and women who complete an apprenticeship program earn more than those who don’t. The average salary of an employee who finishes an apprenticeship program is $60,000.
As President, I will make doubling union membership in the United States my top priority.
And unions have helped pave the way for safer working conditions, higher wages, and better benefits. Unions for all industry sectors – healthcare, education, manufacturing, federal government, construction, aerospace, transportation, and more — are the foundation of our economy.
Less than 11% of wage and salaried workers in the United States are members of labor unions, down from 20.1% in 1983. We know workers want to participate and have a voice in workplace negotiations.
The Chief Manufacturing Officer would advocate on behalf of our manufacturing workforce to ensure we do not hurt these workers through the unintended consequences of some policies.
As President, I would establish an office at the White House, headed by a U.S. Chief Manufacturing Officer, to develop and drive a national manufacturing strategy, set goals for production, increase advanced manufacturing, and troubleshoot manufacturing-related issues.
As we look into how we rebuild our manufacturing sector, we need to look to advanced technologies and the maker movement to help increase and create jobs in the manufacturing sector.
The United States lost 5.5 million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2017, and once domestic manufacturing disappears, so will engineering and other high-paying economic sectors.
The six point industrial plan will: ✅Strengthen the manufacturing sector✅Double union membership in the US✅Expand registered apprenticeship programs✅Rebuild our forgotten cities ✅Help left-behind workers ✅Decentralize economic opportunity
Our economic policy cannot put corporations before the hardworking men and women of our country. Today, I'm releasing my industrial plan to re-empower workers and revive the American middle-class.

Our children aren’t a left or right issue. We have to all come together for the wellbeing of our children ; ensure they are not just surviving but thriving. Most recently, I’ve really enjoyed reading A Nation At Hope  
The research on ACEs tells us that our children who have experienced trauma can recover from  with support. We MUST invest in our schools, after-school programs, therapies and counselors to ensure our children thrive.  
The question has always been, how do we get test scores up. We need to shift the question to, how do we take care of our kids.    
 Such an important part of helping to ensure our children's mental and physical health. 
 skills are *just* as important as academic skills. 👏Just in case they didn't hear you  
Social-Emotional ; academic learning is about teaching our children how to set goals, make responsible decisions, and maintain positive relationships. We need to ensure our teachers ; educators are supported with the tools they need to implement in their classrooms.  
 Absolutely agree! Nothing is more important than caring for our children both inside and outside of school. 
We need to ensure every school in the country is on a path to becoming a public community school, with tailored supports that match local resources and assets to student and community needs. Including trauma-informed care and social-emotional learning.  
 Thank you for everything YOU do to help ensure our children are thriving.

We need to build an economy that works for everyone. Where workers are cut in on the deal and actually benefit from the economic gains they help create.
We have to cut through the political rhetoric and present solutions to the challenges people are facing everyday. Can I make the rent? Can I afford the insulin? Do I need to take on a second job?
Trump is well positioned to WIN. No matter what these latest polls say right now we need to get real about this. He is speaking to peoples fears, reigniting racial divisions and continuing to divide us. We HAVE to beat him. 
Truth.

We need an aggressive policy around regenerative agriculture. We have to support our farmers, increase drought and flood resilience plus mitigate climate change. How? By sequestering carbon!

This is a great step in the right direction. Over the past several decades as productivity has skyrocketed, wages have flatlined, leaving behind millions of hard-working American families. In the wealthiest nation in the world, nobody should work and be poor. 
“Here in America we breathe life into dreams. We create the future, and the world follows us into tomorrow... If we ever closed the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost.” — Ronald Reagan 
You are absolutely right, Mallory. We can't allow our kids to think this behavior is normal or will be tolerated. I fully support impeachment proceedings but it needs to go through committee hearings to fully make the case. 
There is no bottom to the level of vile and hate this president is willing to go. Enough. We can no longer allow him to set the tone for the country.

 To heal student 'trauma,' Tim Ryan wants a mental health counselor in every school  
 so sorry I couldn’t be with you at  today. 
I stand with you There are real people behind the numbers of jobs lost at Lordstown and we have to put our workers first.

When I think about the Democratic Party, when I think about the United States of America, when I think about the values that undergird our very system, it comes down to the fact that this country is about helping ordinary people do something extraordinary. 
It was hard to watch the floor debate today. Trump is abusive and divisive. He is spreading fear and pitting us against each other all while Republicans enable him. Our country is unraveling.
Thank you for the birthday wishes, Keep up the great work for Pete and I’ll see you on the trail! 
 Thank you!
Stagnant wages and outsourced jobs continue to add stress and put an incredible burden on everyday working families.
If there is no accountability and no consequences, this vicious cycle of needless violence will never end and there will be no justice. This decision is irresponsible and heartbreaking. 
We have to heal the country and refocus our conversation on economic issues that are impacting the working poor. People who are doing everything right and can’t ahead. 
Birthday wishes from my guy. No better way to start my day.

Thank you for asking the question and pressing for a climate debate! Would be glad to host in Youngstown.
Failure to address a changing climate will cause significant economic damage. We have to take bold steps to invest in a green economy, in green jobs and green technologies so we can protect the planet and put American workers back to work. 
We can’t heal as a country if we don’t recognize that the president’s rhetoric is vile and divisive. We need to call it out when we see it. All of us.

 Congressman Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Democratic candidate for President, ; author of A Mindful Nation: How a Simple Practice…
This isn’t about governing by threatening and racist tweets but by focusing on what’s best for every American. Our struggles and fears are interconnected. Whether you're from Youngstown, Ohio, New York City, Oakland, CA or Greenville, SC our worries and fears are the same.
Our country must heal and remember the hopes and dreams of everyday working class people. They want to keep a roof over their family's heads and food on the table, to visit the doctor when they get sick, and to retire with dignity.
We don’t talk enough about how our kids are processing what's happening in the world but they are watching. They're worried about our climate, their ability to go to school and not get shot, their mental health. They're growing up with the same fear and stress we're all feeling.
While many of our kids grew up in a time of hope, they now fear for their friends who might be deported, fear that the most important leader in our country is a bully. One who uses all the words and attacks that they are forbidden to use in our homes and schools.
This trauma is real. We’re living with it day to day and our kids are carrying it with them. The night of the election in 2016 our lives were changed, the attacks on immigrants and women’s bodies became more real than ever before but our children were also changed.
We need a leader who can take on Trump and keep us safe. The constant state of stress and anxiety about our ability to make the rent or how to stretch a dollar on top of the instability of our country is too much.
The fear of our immigrant friends and neighbors being ripped from their homes, the fear that the president may tip us into an unwanted war, the fear that you may be pulled over for a traffic stop and get shot and the world won’t skip a beat.
This news cycle that never stops and keeps us on edge is meant to divide us and incite fear. People are scared. They want to be protected and saved from this constant nightmare we are living.
These racists attacks on my colleagues shouldn’t come as a surprise. Trump has shown us who he is. A racist who’s goal is to incite fear and hate to divide us at every turn.We must stand united. 
Regardless of your immigration status, you have guaranteed rights under the Constitution.Know your rights. 
"They want people to be afraid to go to the grocery story. They want people to self deport. They want immigrants to essentially be afraid to engage in the basic activities of life in this country." 
 2020 Candidate Tim Ryan is a hot yoga convert—and says it could be an answer to failed health care for vets. 
While many working families can't get peace and quiet from credit card companies calling nonstop, this guy was getting sweetheart deals to keep him out of federal prison by the former labor secretary. That's everything broken in America in a nutshell.

The economy isn’t “booming” for folks working two or three jobs. I’m for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, but my agenda will also help create jobs that pay real, living wages at $30, $40, $50 an hour -- not just the minimum. 
It’s time for new and better for all of us. 
 It’s time for big change. It’s not left or right. It’s new and better for all of us. The world has blown through the left or right divide of the past 40 years. It’s time forge a new politics.

It is unacceptable that only rich neighborhoods get the good stuff – afterschool programs, mental health counselors, highly-trained teachers, healthy lunches, social-emotional learning programs, pathways for family engagement, new books, technology, and curriculums.

Education is a federal right.

It's pathetic that a country this powerful and wealthy can't come together to fix the structural problems -- from job losses to tax cuts for the rich -- that continue to hurt hard-working Americans.

 'If our kids are so traumatized that they are getting a gun and going into our schools, we're doing something wrong' —
One of the big problems we've had is we've stopped manufacturing things in the US. We need to start building things again: electric vehicles, solar panels ; wind turbines. We can address climate change, get manufacturing jobs back ; drive investment into forgotten communities. 
The Supreme Court’s misguided decision on gerrymandering is an insult to our democracy. The American people deserve fair maps and fair elections.

There's no excuse for the cruelty and trauma these children are experiencing. This will be a stain on our country.
Women shouldn't have to share their most painful and vulnerable stories. But one of the most powerful things we can do is continue to tell stories and cut through the politics. 
This is NOT who we are as a country. This is NOT how we should treat families who are suffering and seeking asylum. We treat war criminals and terrorists better.

 2020 Presidential candidate Tim Ryan talks economics from the SC Dem Convention yesterday.  
We HAVE to end the squeeze on the middle class. We HAVE to eliminate the concentration of wealth. And we HAVE to cut the worker in on the DEAL.
They're working longer and harder for less money and fewer benefits. Cost of living increasing, students paying more and more for tuition, health care and prescription drugs are unaffordable, and rents are skyrocketing.
DOW is up ; the unemployment rate is down! The economy is BOOMING. For who? There are folks who used to make $30/$40 an hour, now working 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet. Nearly 50% of our kids in public schools are low income. The economy isn't BOOMING for the American worker.

The President is erratic, forgetful, ; reckless. We had a peace deal with Iran until  decided to blow it up. Now we, of course, are seeing escalating tensions. It’s unbelievable that we’re supposed to be relieved he didn’t get us into World War III last night.
If we are going to defeat Trump in 2020, Democrats need to connect with working class people across the country. We need someone who knows what real Americans are going through.  
This is disgraceful.  We are the United States of America. The most powerful country in the world and this is how we treat children.  Shame on you President Trump. And shame on all the sycophants who would rather kiss your ass than help these kids.  Disgusting.

One of the things I love about this campaign is sitting down with working Americans to talk about the issues that impact them. Tonight, I had town halls in both Oskaloosa and Washington, IA. We have to make our economy benefit all Americans, not just the wealthy.

The Hyde Amendment is a discriminatory provision that works against those most vulnerable in our country. Safe and legal abortion care is a Constitutional right -- full stop. It must be repealed. 
This is what it’s all about.   😢 
Women should not be alone in this fight. We need to stand with them.  
 just met with GM CEO Mary Barra - he joins me on to discuss
Excited to talk with and on coming up in the next hour!
When women have reproductive freedom, their families and their communities are better off. Reproductive freedom benefits us all.   
The Hyde Amendment is a tax on millions of Americans seeking abortion. It’s wrong and should be repealed. Access to abortion care shouldn’t be limited by your zip code, income, or health care provider. It is a RIGHT

Our food system is broken, and it’s impacting everyone—particularly our children.  help me bring this convo to the debate stage:  We can't afford to NOT be talking about the health of our kids. 
Our health care system is a disease care system. We wait until we get sick and throw a bunch of money at it. We need to have REAL conversations about our health, our food and our agriculture in the United States.

Hey  I’m in LA end of this week. Let’s do a real meditation session with some students. Whattya say?  
Social and emotional learning is imperative to addressing kids' trauma. If you don't take care of the kids trauma, you're not going to be able to teach them. That's why social and emotional learning is a big part of the educational plan.

We are NOT going to cower to the pharmaceutical lobby or the health insurance industry, the agriculture monopolists or the prison industrial complex. Their days are numbered. The scam is up, and I'm asking all Americans to join me today.  
We have learned the hard way that division makes us weak and allows the rich and powerful to prey upon us. We are not going to shrink from the challenges of globalization and automation.
My plan will establish a chief manufacturing officer at the cabinet level to lead this sweeping reform and finally give American workers the ability to thrive -- not just survive.
In the coming weeks, I will unveil a national industrial policy that will bring our manufacturing sector into the 21st century.
I’m going to fight for ALL the Americans left behind by Trump's elitist economic agenda that puts the well-being of millionaires, billionaires and corporations above that of hardworking people.

Jamie and I have been in a political foxhole many times when we were in the majority in 2007-11. He is exactly who we need in the Senate taking on the issues that are important to all the forgotten people in America. 
Let the American people watch. We have to give them the opportunity to hear the truth for themselves. 
Congress has to get to the bottom of this and unpack it with full transparency. The President, no President, is above the law.  And it’s Congress’ job to make sure we are true to our founding principle that the President is not a King and must answer to the American people.
It is clear Mueller thinks the President obstructed justice, but felt the law prohibited him from charging the President. So, evidently the President is above the law. If a citizen from Ohio did the same thing, he would be in prison.

People like Rick Marsh have had their lives flipped upside down. This is just one of many stories from Lordstown. But we also know this is a reality across the country for millions of forgotten Americans. This economy is not working for working class people.

These comments are heartbreaking. We must address the chronic and traumatic stress of our veterans and service members. 
Every day working Americans are suffering. 75% of people are living paycheck to paycheck. Just getting by and just surviving and they are sick of it. People want to thrive again. 
No one should live in fear in the United States. No one should feel insecure or shamed in the United States. We are a country of immigrants and we will continue to be a country of immigrants long after we send Trump back to Mar-a-Lago.

If we are going to come together as a country, we have to lay a better foundation for understanding that.  We have to move away from the negative and combative rhetoric that we’ve had these three years and move to one that is more understanding and inclusive.
But we KNOW that working class rural America AND urban America encompasses difference races and ethnicities. It always has and it always will.
Let’s be clear. When Trump talks about the “working class” he’s aiming to divide. Pitting white workers against black workers and black workers against people of color. He’s intentional about that.

 Rep. Tim Ryan: When are these legislators going to give a shit about the baby once it's born!?

We have ignored mental health for far too long in this country. We need comprehensive health services that do more to deal with mental illness and I will fight for it everyday until it happens.

We know many Americans are experiencing devastating stress and anxiety that comes from living paycheck to paycheck or being worried about the cost of getting sick. We have to build the America we deserves so that all Americans can thrive — not just survive. 
China is cleaning our clock.  We need to invest into the US and out compete them. Tariffs only get you headlines. Let’s build a new economy where we lead industries in new technologies and build the strongest middle class ever.

This is not the America we want or deserve. The government needs to help make these systems work again. People matter.  
More women in the US—particularly black women—die of pregnancy- and childbirth- related causes than in any other high-income country. Let's fight against maternal mortality to ensure we never have to imagine a world  
We have to cut the worker in on the deal. They shouldn’t have to work 2 or 3 jobs and worry about whether or not their kids are going to have healthcare or if they’re going to make the bills this month. We need an economy that works for ALL Americans. Not just the 1%.

Ryan for president: The ‘Uncandidate’ - Delaware Gazette.        Thank you for this!  I will walk into the Oval every morning thinking about the challenges of the workers who are struggling to move up.  And pushing the gov and businesses to do better.  
I grew up pro-life. I've shifted my thinking over the years thanks to the bravery of women like and the voices of thousands of others that showed that government has no place in these in incredibly personal decisions.  
 Thank you We have amazing candidates in the primary. Appreciate you taking the time to share feedback on our YT interview. — Team Ryan
So when I’m gone for long stretches on the road I sometimes try to surprise my guy with a little toy. So here it is. And it makes me want to jump on a plane and go right home. It may work for him, but this makes me miss the fam even more. Thanks for the video Boo.

Heartbreaking. 
Trump administration has ripped kids from their parents’ arms, put babies in cages, and ignored American laws that allow refugees to legally request protection in our country. A year later, not all families have been reunited. We can't stop fighting

  Best administration money can buy. Thank God we don’t have a diabetes epidemic or anything. I mean it’s only almost half of adults in our country that have diabetes or pre-diabetes.  Nothing to see here. 
I've shared 10 years of taxes to share my commitment to transparency and honesty with the American people. I know we are stronger when we restore the unity and trust our country deserves. 
Good question.  Research, infrastructure, incentives in the tax code to help us organize and dominate the growing industries like electric vehicles and Solar. China/German have industrial policy.  We need one here. Gov needs to create the environment for business to thrive. 
Over Half a Million U.S. Troops Deployed Since 2001 Have PTSD with 80% of them receiving inadequate care. We MUST do better to support our veterans.

Our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive — the risk to be alive and express what we really are. — Miguel Ruiz 
My Andrea has been a teacher for 16yrs. And watching her has taught me that teaching is not a job, it's a way of life.  It's setting a good example, it's having those tough conversations that lead to growth, it's caring enough to ask how you're doing. 
The United States needs an industrial policy that invests in emerging markets, creates jobs in America, and grows our economy. If we want to win the future and rebuild the American Dream, we need focused leadership.
TY  The Real Wage chart captures everything you need to know.  We are not feeling the “miracle” economy in industrial America.  We need an industrial policy in the US. 
This makes me sick to my stomach.  So one of our family members should be denied healthcare?   Because of a their Doctor’s religious beliefs?  12 yrs of Catholic school and I was NEVER  taught to ignore someone in need,  it was the exact opposite.   
Thank you   If we don’t get health care costs under control we will have no money left for new green economy jobs, research, infrastructure or education. This is where it starts.  Thank you for your leadership. Let’s forge a new politics.

We've got to talk about the future. The US needs an industrial policy that invests in electric vehicles, solar, wind, artificial intelligence ; additive manufacturing. We need to dominate these industries of the future, because we're falling behind right now. 
 awesome. Yes. Please spread link around. We passed the threshold to get on stage with polling.  Still working the low dollar angle. Spread the word!

Sorry to hear about your brother  I will keep fighting. We have to get this country back focused on rebuilding the middle class. 
I was honored to be with you  We are going to change this country. 
So....”we’re killing it on the economy”. This is so arrogant. Do you people have any idea what average people are going through?  GM workers?  Falcon Transport? Teachers who haven’t had a raise? Zero middle class agenda. Get back to work. 
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my 2020 vision with you all. When we support our unions, educators and students, there’s nothing America can’t do.

People ask me “why are you running for President?”  The people in this article are why. Working people can’t get ahead. We need a new way forward.  A New Politics so we can build an economy that helps people who work hard and play by the rules.  
Thank you  My administration will identify the root cause of our problems. And then use the convening power of the Presidency to unite us around an agenda to fix it.  And then I will use the power of the Presidency to drive, push the agenda.  We can do this together. 
I’m proud of Dave Green. We need an industrial policy in the US that drives innovation and quality, middle class jobs into these communities that have been devasted over the last 40 years.  I will use every drop of Presidential power to rebuild the American middle class.

I’m running for president to end the decades of broken promises and failed leadership that have devastated our communities. It’s time for us to innovate -- so that we can elevate all Americans and build an economy that works for everyone.

These tragedies must stop. We know what we must do and there is no time for inaction. Our kids certainly deserve better.  
I like Miller Lite in a can. You fellas? 
We need to stand up and fight for the future of working families. I’m running for president -- to cut workers in on the deal, rebalance the scales and rebuild our economy to work for all Americans.

Mr President, I find it disrespectful to workers across the country to brag about how good the economy is. We are bleeding out jobs. Just lost GM. Lost another 800 this weekend. You say nothing. You best pray I don't win the Democratic nomination. I WILL hold you accountable. -TR

We know an increasingly stressed America is leading to a decline in life expectancy. For the first time in more than a century.  ; spotlight why this is happening. Definitely worth watching. 
We are more divided now than ever. We must tackle the real issues plaguing our country and  come together to win the future.  We have to find common ground so we can reach higher ground.

When 40% of Americans cannot afford to pay for a $400 emergency, it underscores a very real and much larger issue in our country—hardworking families are being left behind. We need higher wages, stronger benefits, and a secure retirement.

Americans are overwhelmed with the stress and anxiety from living paycheck to paycheck, not being able to afford to put food on the table or forgoing outrageously expensive life-saving medication. We deserve better, and I know we can do better.
Jaime is one of the great new leaders in America.  I’m proud to fully support him in this endeavor. This will happen. 
This is a huge victory. Our workers deserve to be treated better—higher wagers, affordable health care, and a secure retirement. Incredibly proud of the 31,000  workers and for standing strong. 
Another poll just dropped, and once again, our campaign's showing momentum. We're now 2/3 of the way to the debate stage in June. It's on! I'm ready to share a vision where we not only survive, we thrive. Help us get there: 
 Thank you for standing up for Americans' right to vote! 
I’m in! Climate change demands unprecedented action that requires our full and complete attention. This is an economic issue, a social justice issue, and a national security issue. 
There is no planet B. We have a responsibility to take care of of the one we have now. And that means taking the necessary steps to combat climate change today—we cannot wait any longer for action. 
America cannot be asleep at the wheel, while China is planning for the future. I can't say this enough—we need to enact an industrial policy that invests in emerging technology and markets. These cars should be built in the United States.

I'm running to fix the economic anxiety Americans all over the country are facing. They're working hard, playing by the rules and still can't get ahead. The American people deserve the economic security not just to survive, but to thrive. 
Thank you and The forgotten areas will be comeback areas using public/private partnerships.   
Looking forward to joining on today to talk about the campaign. Tune in to at 5 pm ET!
Wishing you and your family a happy and blessed Easter!
My man!   We don’t want to be lying in our graves wondering if we  had spent our living days well. Let’s do this. 
40% to 50% of American families today can't withstand a $400 or $500 emergency. We've got to get out of this idea that we just want the American people to survive. Our campaign is about middle class families thriving, about communities thriving ; about America thriving. 
It’s pretty clear that the President obstructed on several occasions. This is serious. The first step needs to be to let continue to open up the investigation. Let the judiciary committee move this forward. I trust Jerry Nadler.

I’m committed to being a powerful force for every American who feels overlooked and abandoned -- who struggles to pay the rent, put food on the table, and build a better future for their kids. Americans are stressed, overworked, and anxious about the future. We can do better.
We need a president who believes in science, not science fiction. The United States is supposed to be leading the way to combat climate change. But instead, this Administration is ignoring the experts, military leaders, and the American people. That will change in 2020.
We need an industrial policy in the U.S. where the president is actually driving the next generation of jobs. We are so divided right now that we are starting to lose the long-term economic battle. 
The devastating stress and anxiety that comes with living paycheck to paycheck is making us sick ; has divided our communities across the nation. We have to fix it. Contribute $1 (or more) to my campaign today:

There is a recession in rural America. Not just in Ohio, but all over the nation farmers are struggling to make ends meet. We need an agricultural agenda that not only supports our nation's farmers, but helps them compete and grow in the 21st century. 
When 40% of Americans can't afford to pay for a $400 emergency, it illustrates a broken economic system where families are struggling just to get by. If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to get ahead in life. But that's not happening here in the U.S.
By 2030, there's going to be 30 million electric vehicles. I want those to be made in the United States. I want the batteries ; charging stations made in the United States. But China dominates 40% of this market—we need to change that and have a plan to invest in the future. 
Proud to say this courageous young man is from my district in Tallmadge, Ohio. We do Grit in NE Ohio. Proud to represent. 
We have to change that, and together, we will.  
I won’t waste your time telling you everything that’s wrong with our country—you already know that the old system is broken and the American dream has fallen too far out of reach for most.
The devastating stress and anxiety that comes with not being able to afford to put food on the table or take your child to the doctor has fractured and divided our communities.
Here in Ohio, unchecked corporate greed and broken promises from the White House have plunged our manufacturing industry into deep crisis, crippling our housing market and forcing working families to leave the state.
We spend way too much time ; energy focused on how to take care of our citizens once they are sick ; not enough time talking about how to prevent them from getting sick in the first place. I’m running for president to fix our broken health care system. 
Check this out.  We need our sleep. Some basic steps can greatly improve our health.  And note how workers who work swing shifts, night shifts have higher health risks. Another reason we need to make work pay.  
Our students are bogged down by debt, teachers underpaid, and schools under-resourced. We need to treat education as an investment, not a budgetary line item. I'm fighting to make sure our students and teachers have the education system they deserve.
Divided we can’t get anything done. But together, we can confront the challenges facing our country and win the future. Donate $1 to my campaign now.  
We need to be focused on the future—That means investing in electric vehicles, additive manufacturing and solar. But right now, China is beating us and owning these markets. We not only have to get the public ; private sectors involved, but we have to move in the same direction.
This should alarm everybody. Our country must do better in providing mental health resources and treatment to our veterans—that includes aggressive outreach and investing in integrative and complementary health care. We need to have their backs. 
Notre Dame is a symbol of France, faith and shared humanity. As a Catholic, I'm absolutely devastated by this. Sending my prayers to the first responders on the scene and the people of France during this time. 
We must deal with our kids trauma so they can thrive.  These practices help get them out of fight or flight, reduce anxiety, increase focus. More please — TR 
Real leaders roll up their sleeves and get to work on uniting this country.

As I travel throughout the country, I've met amazing Americans who are innovating and creating REAL solutions—from manufacturing, to health care, to schools and education. We need to come together so we can bring these ideas forward and rebuild America: 
The President of the United States has failed to pick up his daily briefing and recognize that we have a problem in Central America. He’s always on “executive time” or on the golf course. And we don’t even have an ambassador in Honduras or Venezuela. This is failed leadership. 
On and off the court, paves the way for opportunity and success. His is no different. Congratulations to I Promise students for reaching your educational goals. When we invest in our students, there's nothing they can't do. 
Counting down to    
Looking forward to talking to this morning. Tune in at 9:00 ET! 
So many of our kids are dealing with extreme trauma. We have to give them the tools to process what they have experienced. And most importantly we must listen to young people. 
Failed leadership and broken promises from the White House have made things much worse for everyone — from farmers in Iowa to autoworkers here in the Rust Belt. We deserve a leader with the courage, bravery and optimism this country was founded on. 
 Thank you Appreciate your support!
I’m running for president because we need a new generation of ideas and a leader with the courage, strength and experience to put partisan politics aside. I believe I’m that leader. Help me bring my message to the debate stage in June ⬇️ 
There isn't a community in the United States that hasn't been affected by the opioid epidemic. This public health crisis deserves our full attention and requires strategic action. We need to be focused on providing treatment and services that help and educate the American people.
Drug prices are out of control. We need to rein in Big Pharma's price gouging tactics and allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. No American should have to forgo their life-saving medication. 
Love this! Mason, your creativity and entrepreneurship is exactly what the Mahoning Valley needs. Keep it up! 
It's irresponsible for invoking 9/11 for political gain. It’s un-American to its core because his whole goal is to divide us. We deserve better than this from the most powerful office in the world. We are going to get better.
We need to start respecting each other. A divided America is a weak America. When the president attacks a sitting member of Congress by stoking the flames of racism ; Islamophobia, it's  dangerous because it encourages hatred and violence.
Gov. knows full well that this blatant attack on women's health care rights is unconstitutional. This fight is far from over. 
Yesterday, I spoke to and New Hampshire voters about how we can get everyone on board to combat climate change. We need to all move in the same direction in order to protect our environment, grow our economy, and create jobs. 
Trump’s  goes into effect today. It’s backward, discriminatory, and downright hateful. If you can do the job, you should be able to serve. Period. 
The stress and anxiety in America is through the roof. When you have families living hand-to-mouth, that prevents opportunity and their ability to thrive. Let’s fix our broken systems so that every family can once again reach the American Dream.
 Ryan explains his strategy to defeat President Trump to NH voters  
When nearly 80% in the United States live paycheck to paycheck, that’s an all-American tragedy. They're feeling the squeeze on their bank account as bills pile up and wages remain stagnant. It’s time to stand up and flip this trajectory.
We need to come together with grit and determination to fight for a better future—that's what our country is lacking. And that’s why one week ago today, I launched my campaign for president of the United States. ➡️
It’s time for us to start building the America we deserve. An America that invests in public education, affordable health care and an economy that works for all of us. This is what I’m fighting for—I’m asking you to join me:  
We need to create an industrial policy in the United States—one that fuses innovation, renewable fuels, and manufacturing. We've got the drive and the grit to rapidly grow our economy, we just need the strategic leadership to get there. 
Happy Birthday to my amazing wife and best friend, Andrea. I love you. 
Thank you for inviting and allowing me to share my 2020 vision with you all. Together, we can help people in New Hampshire and across the country reach the American Dream. It’s all hands on deck for 2020.

I want to be a powerful force for the working people in this country who feel forgotten in our economy. Contribute $1 (or more) to my campaign today: 
Working Americans deserve a president who’s working just as hard as they are, but Trump's refusal to provide the strategy or focus just isn’t cutting it. I’ll lead with the grit that’s driven us forward for centuries—and that we need to win. 
A doctor's office is for a woman, her family, and her physician—not the government. Full stop. This is one of the most restrictive reproductive rights bills in the country and is a threat to the health ; safety of Ohio women ; their families.  
When 40% of Americans cannot afford to pay for a $400 emergency, we know hardworking families are being left behind. We need higher wages, stronger benefits, and to protect the dignity of a secure retirement.
The American people deserve a real leader who believes in climate change, period. Every minute the White House and its allies spend ignoring this critical issue, they jeopardize our environment, economy, and national security.
Our kids have more stress and anxiety than ever before, but it doesn't have to be that way. We can and must do more to support their social ; emotional learning early on. Pitch in if you want to push these ideas forward to help our children. 
Teachers, administrators ; students at Callanan Middle School get it: Social and Emotional Learning cultivates better students ; healthier adults. It’s time to invest in our kids today with the tools they need to manage stress, mitigate the impact of trauma, ; thrive.
The U.S. needs to make reinvesting back into our schools a priority. We’ve got to stop looking at education as a budgetary line item and start looking at it as an investment. 
The spirit of this campaign is about our shared values and commitment to rebuilding the American Dream. But I can't do this without you. Join me as we fight for a better and stronger tomorrow— ➡️  
Yet another example of this administration turning its back on everyday Americans. We need a president and an administration who will advocate for students, not predatory for-profit colleges. 
That's my pledge to you. 
We can make sure our kids are equipped with the Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) opportunities they need to thrive. Thanks, for welcoming my wife Andrea and me for these important life lessons!

We can protect health care by unifying as progressives and independents against President Trump’s push to kick millions of Americans off of their insurance. Let’s move the ball down the field together for working people in this country. 
I can’t say this enough, while China is preparing for the next 50-100 years, President Trump is more concerned about a 24-hour news cycle. If we want to win the future, we have to invest in new technologies. The U.S. can’t afford to fall behind.

As long as we refocus on the economic problems that are facing most people in the United States, that can be a unifying thing. We start listening to each other. We start respecting each other. That's going to be most important in unifying the country.

We have seen over the last 30 or 40 years, communities like the one I come from, get absolutely devastated with no plan in the United States as to how to bring it back. And it's not just in Ohio, it's all over the nation.
The American Dream has slipped through the fingers of many Americans. Globalization, automation and outsourcing have displaced millions of workers who have in turn lost their health care coverage and their retirement.
