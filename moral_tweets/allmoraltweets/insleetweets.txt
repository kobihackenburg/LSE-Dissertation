 It can't be said enough, the only way we tackle the climate crisis is by leaving no one behind. latest plan does‚Ä¶
Here‚Äôs the truth: Defeating climate change is going to take every single one of us. And that includes farmers and rural communities. 
 Just when you thought climate policies couldn't get more comprehensive...they throw another few dozen page‚Ä¶
US farmers have long fed and led the world in agricultural production and innovation. It‚Äôs about time we start looking out for these communities again. 
‚ÄúAt the end of the day, this and [Inslee's] other plans taken together offer a sharp, clear vision of what the U.S. could look like if it got serious about combatting climate change and protecting citizens.‚Äù  
What‚Äôs happening in the  ‚Äî the planet‚Äôs lungs ‚Äî affects all of us. Once, American leadership might have helped stop this tragedy. But Trump doesn‚Äôt care. And his ego-driven foreign-policy-by-tweet has utterly debased our credibility on the international stage.
‚ÄúGovernor Inslee‚Äôs plan... creates new ways for government to partner with producers that promises better incomes for farmers and ranchers and better outcomes for the environment." - Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack

 Jay Inslee completes climate change policy proposals with plans aimed at agriculture  
 is exactly right. Union workers built America. It‚Äôs time to stand up to corporations and put workers back at the heart of our economy.  
You have laid the groundwork for this achievement. You brought attention to an issue that had been pushed to the back burner for too long. This is a victory for the climate movement ‚Äî and I thank you for your work.

Trump‚Äôs approach to the climate crisis is worse than benign neglect. His hallucination about Greenland, where 11 billion tons of ice melted in one day last week, shows he wants to profit from other‚Äôs misery at the hands of the climate crisis.

My Growing Rural Prosperity Plan is based on 4 strategies: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Investing in agricultural innovations to defeat climate change2Ô∏è‚É£ Keeping farmers farming¬†3Ô∏è‚É£ Investing in rural prosperity and advancing equity4Ô∏è‚É£ Improving forest health and protecting America‚Äôs public lands
My latest  plan is about taking on the climate crisis in agriculture ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also about protecting farmworker rights, expanding rural broadband, protecting our public lands, and improving the lives of rural communities. 
Today, I‚Äôm proud to release my latest  plan, Growing Rural Prosperity. Because in addition to Trump‚Äôs chaos trade agenda and agribusiness consolidation, rural America faces the deep and unprecedented existential threat of climate change.

22/ There are so many people who have helped us get where we are today. I couldn‚Äôt thank everyone by name, but know that I appreciate every single person who has made our  possible. Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and organize. Let's go get ‚Äòem.
21/ And yesterday, on August 19, we hit the 130,000 donor threshold. It‚Äôs clearer than ever: Climate activists can no longer be ignored. I‚Äôm honored and humbled by the incredible surge of support we‚Äôve seen over the last few weeks. Thank you. 
20/ On August 6, we released an aggressive plan to address both white nationalism and gun violence in America. A huge thank you to and for helping us make sure we got this critical plan exactly right.
19/ That week, I went back to the 48217 community as well as Flint, Michigan to release my Community Climate Justice Plan. This plan is based on conversations with and what we learned from Theresa and the other 48217 community leaders. 
18/ Right before the second debate, the Muslim community was kind enough to welcome me to the Islamic Center of Detroit. Muslim people make our country stronger, and I‚Äôm thankful to leaders in Detroit taking the time to talk with me.  
17/ Supporting teachers is personal to me, and I wanted our education plan to improve the lives of students and teachers alike. To do this, I got to work closely with educators and advocates like and and the WA Education Association.
16/ Before the first debate, I met with community members in Little Haiti to talk about how climate change is fueling gentrification and pushing people out of their neighborhoods.Thank you to everyone there who took the time to tell me their stories. 
15/ It was inspiring to meet Theresa, the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, and all the community activists working to build a better future for Detroit and the 48217 community. 
 14/ In early June, I visited Detroit and the 48217 community ‚Äî the most polluted zip code in Michigan, thanks to the dirty tar sands oil processed nearby. There, I met inspiring leaders like Theresa Landrum. 
13/ We collaborated with many groups to get this plan right. A big thank you to and all the groups who helped us make it happen!
12/  Throughout May, we released some incredible policy proposals, but I especially enjoyed working with immigrant and worker rights groups as we created a plan to overhaul our immigration system and make sure it‚Äôs humane, efficient, and just. 
11/ In May, I visited Davenport, IA. Like Hamburg, the town was devastated by record-breaking floods. But the destruction we saw was matched only by the determination of its residents to recover.   
 Thank you for taking our generation‚Äôs future seriously üåçYou‚Äôve shown the public that the  is no‚Ä¶
In movies, climate change is near-universally used as a plot device for sacrifice or doom. But storytellers in Hollywood should remember that stories about climate change can change public consciousness about clean energy and sow hope. 
10/ I am so inspired by him and the climate justice leaders we‚Äôve met across the US. Thank you.
9/ Later in April, I had the honor of meeting Harold Mitchell in South Carolina. Harold is standing up to big polluters and fighting for the wellbeing of people in his community. 
8/ The people there showed great courage and resilience. I‚Äôm more convinced than ever they deserve a president with the courage to act on climate. 
 7/ In April, we traveled to Hamburg, Iowa where record-breaking floods had left many people without heat and drinkable water for weeks. 
 6/ I want to give a special thank you to who I had the honor of striking with outside the in May. At just 14 years old, she is a powerful force for good and an unstoppable leader in the climate movement. 
5/ Throughout this campaign, I have been inspired by the tireless work of young people fighting for a better future ‚Äî including and more.
4/ On March 15, I went on  in New York City with young people from around the country. 
3/ Early in March, we visited Agoura Hills, CA where I met Marsha Maus. Marsha‚Äôs home was completely destroyed by the Woolsey Fire, which was made worse by climate change. Thank you to Marsha and the people of Agoura Hills for sharing your stories with me. 
2/ I want to take some time to talk about how far we‚Äôve come since we launched on March 1 ‚Äî and to introduce you to some of the incredible people we‚Äôve met and who have helped get us to where we are today.  
1/ At 7‚Äå:03 am ET on Mar‚Äåch 1, Amy from New York became our first donor. Last night, Linda from Kentucky chipped in, too. Between Amy and Linda, 129,998 people (and now more) have invested in this campaign. I‚Äôm honored. Thank you.

 10/ I could go on and on. But we have to stop asking, ‚ÄúIs Donald Trump racist?‚Äù He has never missed an opportunity to divide us for his own political gain. He is a racist, period.And we must vote him out in 2020, period.
9/ Trump has a long history of talking about ‚Äúinfestation‚Äù in relation to people of color, as pointed out by  
8/ Just last month, Trump said four congresswomen of color should ‚Äúgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.‚Äù
7/ In January 2018, Trump said America did not want immigrants from ‚Äús‚Äîhole countries‚Äù like Haiti and African nations. 
6/ In August 2017, a man drove his car into a group of counter-protestors at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, VA, killing Heather Heyer and injuring dozens more. Trump said there were ‚Äúvery fine people, on both sides.‚Äù
5/ Within a week of taking office, Trump instated a Muslim ban ‚Äî an executive order to block ‚Äúforeign terrorist entry.‚Äù The ban is blatantly discriminatory and wrong. 
4/ In the same speech he announced he was running for president, Trump said about Mexican people: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists.‚Äù 
 3/ For years, Trump led the racist birther movement, lying about President Obama‚Äôs citizenship in an attempt to ingratiate himself with the far-right. 
2/ has built his entire political career on racism. And we know racist words lead to racist violence.

It‚Äôs time for Donald Trump to take ownership for his encouragement of hate and violence in America.From hateful chants at his rallies, to racist tweets, to praise for white nationalists, this president has done more to divide the United States than any leader in modern history.

When Donald Trump threatened to place refugees in states like mine that oppose his ugly immigration policies, I said that is not a threat to me. 
We must restore the American dream for asylum seekers and refugees, who are looking for safety, security, and possibility, just like generations of new Americans before them.
Immigrants and refugees built America and helped define our national identity.  History has never been kind to those who reject refugees in their moment of need. President Trump's hateful rhetoric and xenophobic policies bring back memories of our darkest times.
I never thought I'd see an American president consider a proposal to end refugee admissions. This plan is fundamentally un-American, and it would undoubtedly lead to more deaths and trauma for refugees.

7/ And my Evergreen Economy Plan shows how we will create 8 million good, family-wage and union jobs building a more just, innovative and inclusive clean energy economy.  
6/ My Freedom from Fossil Fuels Plan clearly articulates how America can and must reject projects like the Line 5 pipeline and tunnel, and transition our nation off of fossil fuels.  
5/ Already the clean energy sector employs three times more American workers than those that work in fossil fuels ‚Äì and four time as many in the Midwest. 
4/ It is imperative that we invest in building an American clean energy future, and defeat climate change with good-paying jobs that grow clean energy industries. But to do this, we must reject the dirty fossil fuel projects of the past. 
3/ This dangerous pipeline must be decommissioned, the proposed oil tunnel must not be built, and clean alternatives must be explored immediately.

Thanks to the progressive grassroots, climate activists, and Democrats across the country, we are one step closer to giving climate change the attention it requires in this race.

 Hi everyone! I‚Äôm Trudi Inslee. Tonight is the big night! I‚Äôm taking over for Jay here on Twitter because, as you might guess‚Ä¶
Jay has done so in our state and will do it for the rest of our country. - TI
As we defeat climate change, we can create millions of good, union jobs. We can provide affordable education with well-paid teachers, provide access to health care for all, protect immigrants, and enact gun safety legislation. - TI

Defeating climate change has to be the top priority of the next administration. Pretty darn simple. If we don‚Äôt, nothing else matters. We have a moral responsibility to leave a safe and healthy environment for future generations. This cannot wait. - TI
From 1998 until 2012, Jay served in Congress again. And since 2013, he‚Äôs been governor of Washington. Together, we decided he should run for president because we want to do everything we can to solve the climate crisis. - TI
Ever since Jay lost his seat, I‚Äôve been passionate about sensible gun safety legislation. I also believe every child deserves a safe place to call home and a great education so I‚Äôve focused on ending youth homelessness and providing more early learning opportunities.- TI 
In ‚Äò92, Jay was elected to the US House of Representatives. He knew he might lose his seat if he voted for a ban on assault weapons in ‚Äò94. It was the right vote, he did lose his seat, but he‚Äôs never regretted it for a minute. - TI 
Here are a few photos of the family campaigning for Jay‚Äôs reelection in 1990. The boys and I have always been really proud of their dad. - TI 

When my mom first met Jay, she told him, ‚ÄúYou should go into politics.‚Äù We just laughed at the time. Turns out, she was right. Jay first ran for the Washington House of Representatives in 1988. - TI 
Here‚Äôs Jay sledding with our grandson. It‚Äôs little moments like this. - TI 
We‚Äôre also delighted to have two grand-pups and two grand-cats! - TI 
Our best memories are of doing ordinary things with our boys Jack, Connor, and Joe. They‚Äôre grown and married, so now we have 3 daughters (their spouses), 3 grandchildren, and 1 more arriving in December. - TI 
Here‚Äôs Jay with his dad at our son Jack and daughter-in-law Megan‚Äôs wedding in 2001. Frank had a great sense of humor. We miss him. - TI 
Caring about the environment is in Jay‚Äôs DNA. His favorite childhood memories are of exploring the tide pools with his dad, Frank, who taught biology. And now he loves to explore the beach with our grandkids - TI 
Jay is also the one who introduced me to hiking. I remember thinking, ‚ÄúWhy am I wearing a pack and heading uphill?‚Äù Here we are with his mom, Adele and brother, Todd near Mt. Rainier in the ‚Äò70‚Äôs - TI 
Even though photo doesn‚Äôt show it, our wedding day by Green Lake was a perfect August blue sky day in Seattle. I was the sixth in family to wear my grandmother‚Äôs dress. Jay wore a new polyester suit. We had cake and punch in the church basement. - TI

A lot of people are wondering how I‚Äôm preparing for the debate tomorrow. I‚Äôm in Miami, listening to people on the frontlines of the climate crisis.  
 NOW: Gov. on MSNBC
We will end the gravy train of fossil fuel subsidies and invest that money into building a clean energy economy. We must stop giving away our taxpayer dollars to corporations that pollute our air and water and fuel the climate crisis.   
 That‚Äôs it from me. I hope you‚Äôll tune in to see Jay at the debate tomorrow at 6 PM PT/9 PM ET. I know how excited he is to get to share his vision with America. - 
 I‚Äôm proud to work for this campaign and for Jay. And tomorrow, when he‚Äôs on the debate stage, the rest of the country is going to see exactly what I see every day: Why he should be our next president. - AK 
 If you want to see more plans like the ones we‚Äôve already put together, donate now. Because we‚Äôre just getting started. - AK  
 This campaign has come so far since we launched in March. We‚Äôve released four robust plans that map out exactly how the United States can defeat climate change. Who else can say that? No one. - AK

 On the night of the town hall, my daughter Hannah said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the president my mom works for! Jay Inslee.‚Äù - AK
 Like I said, I‚Äôve worked with Jay for a long time. Running a presidential campaign with two small kids seemed challenging (to say the least) but the Gov said ‚ÄúBring the kids. We‚Äôll make it all work.‚Äù - AK 
 Beryl was the first person to fly solo, nonstop across the Atlantic from east to west. Jay drew it three times because he didn‚Äôt like how the first ones turned out. He gave it to me with a note about powerful women leading the way. - AK
 Something a lot of people don‚Äôt know about Jay is that he‚Äôs a really great artist (he calls himself a ‚Äúdoodler‚Äù). He made me this drawing a few weeks ago. It‚Äôs of Beryl Markham. - AK  
 And you see that. Like when he voted against the Iraq War and for the '94 Assault Weapons Ban (which cost him his congressional seat). The decisions he makes aren't easy ‚Äî because as governor, any decision you‚Äôre making is likely a tough one. - AK 
 Jay is thoughtful about making decisions as a leader. He‚Äôs very cognizant of the impact his decisions have on people‚Äôs lives. He‚Äôs always focused on making the right decision, not the popular one. - AK
 If you want a candidate who will make defeating climate change the number one priority, consider chipping in and helping power this campaign. - AK 
 Have to share: Here‚Äôs when Jay and Trudi met my youngest daughter, Tabitha, for the first time. - AK 
 When the Gov talks about wanting to be able to tell his grandkids he did everything he could to defeat climate change, he really means it. And that‚Äôs how all of us feel ‚Äî it‚Äôs what drives this campaign forward. - 
 And just look at everything he‚Äôs accomplished in the last 6 years! The nation‚Äôs best 100% clean energy bill, the first state public health care option, free college for families in need‚Ä¶ The list goes on and on. -
I never envisioned myself working for a candidate. But it was so clear to me early on that Jay was different. So, years later, I worked on Jay‚Äôs first campaign for governor, and then I managed his reelection campaign in 2016. -

It‚Äôs time to take on big polluters. Watch live as I release my Freedom from Fossil Fuels plan. 
Just like big tobacco, fossil fuel companies have lied to Americans for decades. And we‚Äôre the ones paying the price. That‚Äôs unacceptable ‚Äî and I have a plan to put an end to it. Watch my livestream here at 11 AM ET as I announce my Freedom from Fossil Fuels plan. 
To defeat climate change, we need a president that isn‚Äôt afraid to take on big polluters and hold them accountable. And that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm going to do. Tune in live today at 11 am ET for a special announcement.
 Nonsense. Never enough pictures of clouds. They‚Äôre incredible. Get it,
I‚Äôm not afraid to take on big polluters. This moment and this mission to defeat climate change demands that we do. 
I refuse to leave our kids and grandkids with a world ruined by climate change. We have a moral responsibility to defeat this crisis.
Coal workers are dedicated, hard-working people. They deserve our honesty and our support. In Washington, we‚Äôre taking care of coal workers ‚Äî we must do that across the United States. 
The fastest-growing job in America is solar panel installer. The second fastest-growing? Wind turbine technician. There‚Äôs no denying that clean energy is the future of jobs. 
Denying the urgency of the climate crisis is denial too
Dangerous and irresponsible. We need an administration that will take the climate crisis seriously. 
I want to build an economy American workers can depend on and one that will defeat climate change. 
 I‚Äôm going to hand it back over to the Gov now. Thanks for reading along, and I hope to see you on the trail! - Alex  
 I‚Äôm proud to work for this campaign and to meet so many inspiring people on the trail. I really believe in this mission, and if you want to see more from us, I hope you‚Äôll donate before the debates. - AF 
 Here are and posing with Honest Abe before milkshakes. - AF 
 The Gov also has to try the local milkshake spot, wherever we go. Someone told him about this place that had milkshakes named after presidents, and that‚Äôs that. He says we‚Äôre rerouting to the milkshake spot. - AF
 The Gov will be late to meetings because of it! It makes my life harder sometimes, but it‚Äôs also really cute. - AF
 My time on this takeover is almost up. But I want to tell you one more story from the road. Without fail, every single trip, Jay sends a postcard to his wife, Trudi. - AF
 On the spot in CA, no questions asked, the Gov jumped into the rally and spoke to the students. It was incredible to see a candidate make time to talk to these young leaders ‚Äî at the expense of rubbing shoulders with people at the convention. - AF 
 The Gov has always been inspired by the young people striking and demanding a  We‚Äôve attended strikes from Las Vegas to New York. - AF 
 While we were at the California Democratic Convention a few weeks ago, Maggie  ran into some of the organizers of a youth  rally outside the convention. - AF
 But Jay Inslee is not your regular candidate. And there‚Äôs never been a campaign like this ‚Äî one that puts defeating climate change right at its center. If you believe in that, like I do, chip in now. - AF 
 This trip was meaningful for a lot of reasons, but maybe the biggest of all is that presidential candidates don‚Äôt do trips like this. Many people we met that day told us that a candidate had never taken the time to hear their community‚Äôs story. - AF 
 Jay also met with Valerie Jean, whose neighborhood was without water for days after the city shut it off. Her 86-year-old neighbor went without it for 11 days and never recovered. - AF 
 The Gov met with Theresa Landrum who, alongside her neighbors, is standing up to powerful corporate and fossil fuel interests. These people need a president who isn‚Äôt afraid to stand up, either. - AF 
 One of the neighborhoods we went to is right next to the Marathon Refinery ‚Äî  and thanks to the dirty tar sands oil refined there, this ‚Äúfenceline‚Äù community is considered to be the most polluted zip code in Michigan.- AF
 In Detroit, Jay and the team spent the day with environmental justice leaders and frontline communities, and heard stories about how fossil fuels are affecting their day-to-day lives. - AF 
 Since we kicked off this campaign in March, we‚Äôve met with so many incredible people across the country. One of the trips that stands out to me most was when we went to Detroit.  - AF
Hey all. Alex  here. The Gov is busy getting ready for the debates this week, so I‚Äôm taking over here on Twitter. I want to tell you about some of the inspiring people we‚Äôve met on the road the last few months. 
That‚Äôs the end of my takeover! Thanks for letting me tell you about how we‚Äôre building big, bold plans that drive this country forward.  -
Like the Gov, I want to be able to say we did everything possible to preserve human civilization from this catastrophe. Because it is worth it. - GP 
Jay Inslee is the only candidate who truly gets it. He‚Äôs the only one who understands what we need to do to defeat climate change and preserve our way of life. - GP
We‚Äôre passionate about putting together robust plans like these because we know: The next president must launch a full-scale mobilization of this country to defeat climate change. That‚Äôs what this all adds up to. - GP 
These plans make it clear: Jay Inslee isn‚Äôt just looking at how to do something around the edges. He wants to figure out how to accomplish big progressive wins that move the country forward. - GP
 When we create the policies on our campaign, we think about a couple different things: 1. Who are the people impacted?; 2. How can we build on the success the Gov has had in WA?; and 3. Where can our policies do the most good? - GP
 There‚Äôs no doubt about it: Donors like you have made it possible for us to develop robust, meaningful plans like this. If you want to see more plans from our team, chip in now. - GP 
 It‚Äôs a plan to rebuild American leadership through climate mobilization. That‚Äôs revolutionary. - GP 
 But we weren‚Äôt done yet (and we still aren‚Äôt, by the way). Just a few weeks ago, we released our Global Climate Mobilization Plan ‚Äî the first-ever foreign policy plan that puts climate change right at the center. - GP
 I was really proud of this plan because it got a lot of recognition for its intersectionality. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a plan that reflects the fact that all of us deserve justice and opportunity. - GP
 Hey everyone. I‚Äôm part of the policy team here on  I‚Äôm taking over the Gov‚Äôs Twitter account this‚Ä¶
 Then, at the end of May, we put together our immigration plan, America‚Äôs Promise. In Washington state, we know that immigrants strengthen and enrich our communities. This plan is built on that.  - GP
 I thought this headline summed it up best. Because the Gov wants to defeat climate change, of course, but he‚Äôs also passionate about making sure we look out for America‚Äôs workers. We can create good, family-wage jobs and build a clean energy economy. - GP 
 Next, we released the Evergreen Economy Plan. It's a roadmap to put this country back to work, including the communities and workers who have relied on fossil fuel jobs. It‚Äôs a real, just transition.  - GP 
 Consider it done.
 The Governor‚Äôs vision is the only one that ends a practice that we simply can no longer afford: burning coal. As the Gov likes to say, it‚Äôs a big and bold plan for a big and bold nation. - GP
  and I have worked with the Gov to build the policy plans you‚Äôve seen him release in the last several weeks. Our first was the 100% Clean Energy for America Plan. - GP  
 This is a leader who knows how to get things done. Period. - GP
 It‚Äôs a crowded field ‚Äî believe me, we know. But the Gov is uniquely qualified to be president because he has led a state that is at the front of the pack. That‚Äôs true on climate, yes, but it‚Äôs also true on investments in family, in workers, in health care. - GP
 I guess a good place to start would be to tell you why I joined the Gov‚Äôs team. I know this: Climate change must be the number one priority of the next president. And I know that we must mobilize the entire US economy to meet this challenge and revitalize our country. - GP
 Over the next couple of days, you‚Äôre going to be hearing from a few of us on Team Jay. Tomorrow, you‚Äôll hear from Alex Fujinaka  who‚Äôs going to tell you about some of the inspiring people we‚Äôve met on the road. - GP
Hey everyone. I‚Äôm part of the policy team here on  I‚Äôm taking over the Gov‚Äôs Twitter account this afternoon because I want to tell you about how we‚Äôre translating Washington state‚Äôs success into a vision for a better America for all of us.

We have civil rights in this country. And this is a civil right. Abortion should be a civil right protected by federal statute.  
 Listening to Gov. Jay Inslee at  his message: clear, concise, logical and smart. 
 "When we get rid of the Hyde Amendment, AND WE WILL, these funds will go to a woman's right to freedom." 
  ‚ÄúI fundamentally believe that reproductive health care is health care ‚Äî full stop, period.‚Äù  
There is no middle ground on reproductive freedom. It is a constitutional right. 
Today, I‚Äôm proud to be speaking at  Forum in South Carolina. This is a critical issue for voters ‚Äî and I‚Äôve spent my career defending and expanding reproductive freedom in the United States. 
Last year, I was proud to sign the Reproductive Parity Act in Washington state, ensuring insurance policies cover both contraception and abortion. 
In Washington, we take care of our workers and families. And we have the strongest economy in the nation because of it ‚Äî not in spite of it. It‚Äôs time to go make that happen for the rest of the country. 
I voted against the Hyde Amendment in 1993. That‚Äôs because it was wrong then ‚Äî and it‚Äôs wrong now. All women, regardless of income, have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. 
Let me be clear: Abortion should be a federal civil right. We must codify Roe v. Wade into law.

 Coming up shortly: on from South Carolina.

It‚Äôs a fact: Floridians live on the front lines of the climate crisis. I‚Äôll be in Miami starting Monday morning to hear their stories. 
Everyone deserves access to clean water, regardless of their zip code. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve proposed a Clean Water for All plan to close the $82 billion annual funding gap in water infrastructure and help communities like West Baltimore. 
This shouldn‚Äôt happen in America. This shouldn‚Äôt happen anywhere. 
Thank you for your support Channing! 
Thank you for speaking out, and Climate change absolutely cannot be ignored during this election.
Don't worry. I will. 
My team and I are working around the clock to get ready for the first debate in just a few days. We‚Äôve set a bold goal of hitting 90,000 donors before I hit the stage. Help us make it happen by chipping in today. 
Fossil fuel infrastructure is not only dirty, it can be extremely dangerous. We need to transition away from fossil fuels for the safety of our communities.

To resolve the fundamental issues around immigration, we must address the climate crisis. That‚Äôs why my plan is built on solutions targeted at the intersection of both immigration and climate change. 
Laffer is the last person who deserves a Medal of Freedom. You don‚Äôt grow the economy by giving tax cuts to billionaires. We‚Äôve blown up that GOP myth in WA. We have the fastest-growing economy because we build from the middle-out, not trickle down. 
We don‚Äôt have time for denial ‚Äî and we don‚Äôt have time for despair. Here‚Äôs some good news about the state of renewable energy today. 
My full statement: 
It is a clear failure of the Trump Administration to protect Americans‚Äô public health and welfare under the Clean Air Act law.
This Dirty Air Rule may be the most destructive environmental policy action ever taken by an American president, and it will foist upon the American people tens of billions of dollars more in climate and health costs, over the next decade and beyond.
Donald Trump‚Äôs undying loyalty to coal CEOs is literally killing Americans. Today‚Äôs action provides yet another egregious giveaway to corporate polluters and fossil fuels.
 is a day of celebration ‚Äî but also a poignant reminder that the fight for justice and equality didn‚Äôt end with slavery. More than a century and a half later, we must recommit ourselves to ending systemic racism in all its forms and achieve true equality for everyone.
Great piece by  We need to create climate policies that put social justice at their core, or else we will only continue to harm communities of color, working families, and the poor. 
When I announced my Global Climate Mobilization Plan, I said that confronting the climate crisis must become central to our foreign policy. That goes for friends and foes alike. The Trans Mountain Pipeline should not be built. 
Washington is proud of our LGBTQ+ community. And we‚Äôre proud to fly the rainbow flag at our state capitol. Happy Pride!
Even my immigration plan, America‚Äôs Promise, which outlines specific solutions at the intersection of immigration and climate change. And my team and I aren't done yet. 
My Global Climate Mobilization Plan, which is the first-ever foreign policy plan that puts climate change at its center. 
My Evergreen Economy Plan, which will ignite America‚Äôs clean energy economy and create 8 million good, family-wage jobs. 
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve released my 100% Clean Energy for America Plan, which outlines exactly how the US can make the switch to clean energy across our economy. 
Thank you, Senator. I agree. I want to be able to tell my grandchildren I did everything humanly possible to solve this crisis. 
Trump says, ‚ÄúWe believe in the Constitution and the rule of law.‚Äù Anyone who‚Äôs read the emoluments clause would beg to differ.
What‚Äôs cruel and heartless is the way Trump has lied to coal workers and their families. He is failing these people by not providing them with a just transition as the industry fades.

The next president must make defeating this crisis the top priority of the nation. And I will continue to do everything I humanly can to ensure the climate crisis is at the top of the national agenda. 
We are running out of time. We've kicked the can down the road for too long. The climate crisis merits a full discussion of our plans, not a short exchange of talking points.
Democratic voters say that climate change is their top issue; the Democratic National Committee must listen to the grassroots of the party.
The DNC is silencing the voices of Democratic activists, many of our progressive partner organizations, and nearly half of the Democratic presidential field, who want to debate the existential crisis of our time.
Further, they explained that if we participated in anyone else's climate debate, we will not be invited to future debates. This is deeply disappointing.

Abortion bans are explicitly intended to gut or overturn Roe v. Wade and punish women. Today, I stand with people around the country who are speaking up for reproductive freedom and saying: 
Thank you to each and every person who has helped power this movement. We need fewer than 5,000 more donors to guarantee a spot at the debates. I hope you‚Äôll consider chipping in:

Senator Arthur is exactly right. The bans we‚Äôve seen put in place across the country are a coordinated attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade. We will not go back to the dark ages of reproductive rights. We must fight back. 
The onslaught of bans we‚Äôve seen in recent weeks isn‚Äôt a coincidence. This is a coordinated attempt by Republicans to ban abortion outright everywhere. This is not just an attack on Missouri or Alabama or Georgia women, this is an attack on all women.
We‚Äôre the last generation that can defeat the climate crisis. And I have a plan that matches the urgency of this moment:  
Union workers built America, but their rights have been under attack for 50 years by powerful corporate interests. We must turn that around.

It‚Äôs abundantly clear that the United States has led the world in carbon emissions. Now we must become the leader in fighting climate change -- and elect a leader who will get it done.

Climate change affects everything. It hurts our economy. It threatens our national security. We can‚Äôt afford to wait.

His climate denial and quack conspiracy theories about climate scientists should be disqualifying from being in public life. 
Republican activist Stephen Moore has been wrong about pretty much every economic debate over the last decade, and that should be reason enough he shouldn't serve on the Federal Reserve Board.
We should be investing in these inspiring athletes and the organization that supports them - not slashing funding. In what world is it ok to line the pockets of billionaires but leave someone like Frannie out in the cold?
Last summer, Seattle had the honor of hosting the 2018 USA games. Getting the chance to meet the incredible athletes, like then 8-year-old Frannie Ronan, and watch them compete is a highlight of my time as governor.
You gave huge tax cuts to billionaires like yourself. This is not difficult. 
I believe our nation is ready for leadership to confront the existential threat of climate change head-on. Because we are the first generation to truly feel its sting -- and the last who can do something about it.  
Oil companies receive billions in taxpayer subsidies, then spend millions to stop efforts from defeating climate change. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for big oil lobbying.

Go dawgs! 
Climate change impacts everything. Already $1.6 billion in damage in Iowa alone. For our economy and for our neighbors, we must act.  
The American public deserves to know the contents of the Mueller Report. Donald Trump and his Attorney General cannot be trusted to summarize or excerpt it accurately.
The cost of climate change is our friends, our neighbors, our communities. When the people and places we love come under threat, we must act to protect them.  
Our Climate Mission Tour Rolls on to Portland, OR tomorrow. We will be taking the momentum of last week‚Äôs  with us.
