I've fought for LGBTQ rights my entire career‚Äîeven when I was told it wasn't convenient to do so‚Äîand I have the most comprehensive LGBTQ rights agenda in the 2020 field.LGBTQ Americans deserve a president who fights for them no matter what. 
We're Democrats. If we're not talking about reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, and getting money out of politics on our debate stages, no one will. That's exactly why I need to be on the debate stage.Chip in to help secure my spot by tomorrow's deadline:

I wouldn‚Äôt want to bike through a monsoon with anyone but you, 
We know what happens when we have a president who doesn't value women: Our most fundamental rights get put on the chopping block.It's about time we had a president who knows that women's rights are human rights, and fights for them no matter what. 
Thirty states around the country are trying to ban abortion. Roe v. Wade is at risk. But I made sure to bring up reproductive rights in the debates, even if there were zero questions about them.Help get me‚Äîand this crucial issue‚Äîto the next debate: 
I don't believe in "impossible." And no matter how tough the fights we're facing are‚Äîwhether it's the global climate crisis, the nationwide assault on reproductive rights, or our gun violence epidemic‚Äîwe have to be brave enough to take them on.  
I take on fights others won't, because I've never lost sight of the fact that I'm fighting for you. I advocate for issues that are too often sidelined, because they deserve a voice.Now I need your help to take that fight to the next debate:  
We're one of the wealthiest and most powerful countries in the world. We're also one of the top carbon emissions producers in the world.If we're not leading the charge to turn the climate crisis around, we're not just failing our own country‚Äîwe're failing the entire planet.

Our planet is on fire. Climate change is here. And its effects will hurt all of us.Like Stephen said, we have one last chance to get this right. And I have the best plan in the 2020 field to do it.
What Secretary Ashcroft did to prevent the will of the people of Missouri is unconstitutional, and quite frankly, pathetic. Reproductive rights are human rights. Abortion needs to be accessible, safe, and legal‚Äîperiod.

Cleaning up our elections won't just root out the corruption and greed in Washington, it will also change who has a seat at the table. And in a healthy democracy, it's everyday people‚Äînot just the wealthy‚Äîwho have a say in how their government works. 
If this Kettering, OH health center is forced to close, the nearest provider would be about an hour away.Attacks on reproductive freedom won't end abortion. They'll just put women and doctors in danger. 
At the end of the day, none of the ideas we're talking about in this election will happen if we don't address the root causes of Washington's dysfunction: greed and corruption.

President Trump doesn't have the guts to stand up to the NRA. If we want elected leaders to actually do their jobs, we need to weed out the ones who are beholden to special interests like the gun lobby‚Äîand we need publicly funded elections to do it. 
One of the biggest issues we're facing in this election is how we can make life better for American families. A great place to start is with my Family Bill of Rights, and I'll get it done in my first 100 days in office:

When a little boy in my son's school came out as transgender, we made sure he knew he was loved and supported. This president wants to demonize him.Our trans community deserves a president who will always fight for them. 
We need to take real steps to ensure that every American has access to the mental health care they need, no matter what.  
Our communities know what they need most when it comes to mental health care, but they need federal support to make it happen. That's why my plan utilizes a comprehensive approach to making access available through community-based health centers.

We shouldn't have to live in an America where we're afraid to leave the house because of mass shootings. There are simple, commonsense ways to change the gun violence epidemic in this country, including a nationwide buyback of military-style weapons. 
There‚Äôs no prize for holding a powerful man accountable. But I believe we should value women, and I believe we should do the right thing even when it's hard.Others may regret standing with women, or back down from fighting for them. I never will. 
If we truly believe that health care is a right and not a privilege, then access to quality mental health treatments cannot be up for debate. It's time for mental health to be taken as seriously as physical health. 
Defending women's rights.Getting money out of politics.Passing Medicare for All.Nothing is impossible if we fight for it.

For nearly 50 years, women have had the constitutional right to safe and legal abortion. It's only right to demand that those basic reproductive rights be a standard for this country.Women's bodily autonomy is the law of the land, and I won't back down on that. 
Right now, millions of Americans live in states where extreme legislators are putting politics over their rights‚Äîresulting in a crisis for reproductive health care access.As president, I will guarantee your reproductive rights, no matter where you live.

No other candidate in this race has made reproductive rights as much of a priority as I have‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs being the first to put out a comprehensive policy agenda or highlighting it in the debates.I won't stop fighting. Help keep me in the debates:  
Roe v. Wade is at risk now more than ever. Our next president needs a comprehensive plan to not only protect Roe, but to expand on every American's right to reproductive health care‚Äîincluding abortion.

 When reproductive rights are under attack, Missourians show up ; fight back! 200+ plus advocates are here to talk 
I'm in St. Louis today to speak with abortion providers and patients on the frontlines of the fight for reproductive rights. One thing's for sure: These brave advocates aren't backing down, and neither will I.  
Join us live for our reproductive rights town hall in St. Louis, MO: 
99 years ago, the 19th Amendment was ratified and white women won the vote. The struggle for suffrage continued for decades, and we're still fighting to protect voting rights.History and momentum are on our side: Women are on fire in America. And I know we'll win this fight. 
Republicans' attacks on reproductive health care have left Missouri with a single abortion provider, and they've bragged about it. Criminalizing doctors and endangering women aren't "pro-life" to me.I'm on my way to St. Louis to fight back. Follow here. 
I'm running for president because I take on the fights that no one else will. Protecting every American's right to a safe and legal abortion is no different. 
National paid family leave will:‚úÖstrengthen workforceparticipation‚úÖboost the economy‚úÖhelp parents raise and bond with their children‚úÖimprove employees' wellbeingThere's no good reason not to support this. 
Republicans are passing extreme abortion bans, seeking to punish women and doctors, appointing extremists to the courts, and gutting family planning funding. And there's a misogynist in the Oval Office stoking it all.This is a war on our rights‚Äîand it's time to fight like hell. 
I was the first candidate to commit to only nominating judges and justices who will uphold Roe v. Wade as law of the land, because to me, reproductive rights are nonnegotiable. I'm heading to Missouri tomorrow to share my plans to protect and expand them. 
We're facing a coordinated GOP assault on our reproductive rights. We have to be as relentless in fighting back as these politicians are in waging it. 
While this president serves no one but his own ego and political agenda, our New Hampshire staff and volunteers are committing themselves to a weekend of public service to help their local communities. Love our team. 
When Georgia passed its abortion ban, I went to Atlanta to stand with advocates and leaders and fight back. Since then, the assault has continued in states across the country‚Äîand that's why I'm going to Missouri. We will keep fighting, and we will win.  
The attacks on reproductive rights across the country are an emergency, yet they've hardly been mentioned in the debates. That's a problem.We need a president who knows that reproductive rights are human rights, and who's willing to go to the frontlines of this fight‚Äîand win. 
Let's remember the goal of the abortion bans we‚Äôre seeing across the country: From Georgia to Alabama to Missouri, these extremist politicians ultimately want to overturn Roe v. Wade and ban legal abortion.Here‚Äôs how I will fight back: 
For a problem as massive and urgent as global climate change, we need solutions that are even bigger and bolder, like passing a Green New Deal. That's why I'm making solving the global climate crisis the cornerstone of my presidency.

With one licensed abortion provider left in the state, the people of MO know what a post-Roe reality would look like: They're already living it.I'll be there on Sunday to hold a reproductive rights town hall. This is an emergency, and we need to fix it. 
Financial security is important for new parents. And so is their overall health and the health of their new baby.Paid family leave covers both. And we desperately need it here in the United States.  
The truth is that we have a gun violence epidemic in this country. But it's also true that we have the power to change it.We can't back down. We have to fight for gun safety legislation in this country like our lives depend on it‚Äîbecause they do.Together, we can win this. 
To truly keep our communities safe, we need to address gun safety not only at the federal level, but also at the state level. And that means having governors who care more about protecting the people they represent than the NRA.

It's alarming enough that the president stokes racism and violence and coddles white nationalists.But there's a group of people who won't call him out on it, and who are refusing to give gun safety legislation a vote. They're Senate Republicans. And it's time to vote them out.
Let's be clear about what's happening today: We have people in this country, fueled by hate, hunting other humans on our streets with weapons of war.That's the national emergency we face. And we need to go back to Washington and vote to stop it now.

Sen. McConnell should call the Senate back into session now. We should vote on universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and large magazines, and anti-gun trafficking measures. These three things will help keep our communities safer, and we can‚Äôt afford to wait.
White nationalist terrorism is a national emergency.
Not even 24 hours later and there‚Äôs another mass shooting. Gun violence in America is a public health epidemic‚Äîyet we have done almost nothing to address it.To the victims and their loved ones in Dayton: My heart is with you.This. Must. Stop. 
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again...and nothing in response. This is domestic terrorism going unchecked and it‚Äôs complete madness. My heart is with El Paso and all the victims and their families.
"My presence at a party does not imply my consent. I wish I could have learned that."It takes tremendous bravery to share your story and then use it to make change. It's also one of the most powerful things we can do. Thank you, Ashley. I hear you, and I believe you. 
I've spent my entire career fighting for women and families, lifting up their stories to make change where it's desperately needed. And I'll keep doing it as president. 
Thank you, Governor Cooper. I hope North Carolina goes on to ban conversion therapy altogether in the state. It's a repulsive, inhumane practice‚Äîand when I'm president, we'll ban it nationwide. 
Health insurers are for-profit companies who are looking out for their shareholders and rich CEOs‚Äînot patients. Until we create a public buy-in option that forces them to compete and lower costs, we won't have health care as a right. We need Medicare for All.  
I'm not afraid to stand up for what's right. I'm not afraid to fight for women. I'm not afraid to take on Trump‚Äîand on Wednesday, I proved I'm the best candidate to do it. 
As I said on the debate stage, the officer who killed Eric Garner with an illegal chokehold should be fired.  
I was raised by strong, brave women who did the "impossible." So if you want to get something done, just tell me it's impossible. I'll get it done. 
When we talk about asylum-seekers crossing our southern border, we need to remember who we're talking about: They're often women and families fleeing violence, desperate to protect themselves and their children from further harm. They are not criminals.  
If white people aren't helping dismantle institutional racism alongside people of color, we're not doing enough.  
 you are the definition of brave.

Al Franken faced eight credible allegations of sexual harassment. 34 other Senators called for his resignation, but now I seem to stand alone. I don't mind. We will not beat Trump if we don't have courage and clarity on this. Others may regret standing with women. I never will. 
Health care in America should be a right. But right now, people can't afford it, and Trump and Republicans are still hell-bent on taking it away. That's the issue we need to focus on.  
As a white woman and a U.S. Senator running for president of the United States, it is my responsibility to understand white privilege and to work to dismantle institutional racism in this country. This burden cannot be left to people of color alone.

It‚Äôs a false choice to say we have to pick between winning progressive Democrats, or winning back voters who went to Trump. We need a nominee who can do both.  
We need the truth. It‚Äôs time to begin impeachment hearings. 
Millions of American women work outside of the home, earn paychecks, and depend on childcare to raise their families. That's not "deterioration of the family."

The officer who killed Eric Garner should be fired. Now. 
When we talk about what‚Äôs going on at our border, you have to remember who we‚Äôre talking about: Women and children fleeing violence. What the Trump administration is doing is inhumane and cruel. Seeking asylum should not be a crime.  
People can‚Äôt afford health care in America. The insurance companies are looking out for their shareholders and CEOs‚Äînot patients. Let‚Äôs not lose the forest for the trees: Health care should be a right.If you want me fighting for your family on the next debate stage, chip in $1.
Let's not forget what this issue is really about: Too many families in America can't afford the health care they need, and Republicans are trying to take health care away. We need to make it a right for all, not a privilege.

Nothing about this election is going to be easy. It's going to take a bold policy agenda to move this country forward‚Äîbut even before that, it's going to take a whole lot of fight to beat Trump.Now is not the time to stick to the status quo. It's time to be brave. 
Women are half of this country. Policies that affect our health, lives, and families should be center-stage‚Äîright up there with the other important issues in this election. 
I have a bold vision for our future, ambitious plans to make it happen, and a record of winning fights no one else will even take on.If you want to get something done, just tell me it's impossible. I'll get it done. 
I'm proud of the substantive debate on ideas our party is having, and looking forward to sharing why I'm the best candidate to beat Trump tomorrow evening.Chip in now to make sure I can stay in the debates: 
2+ hours in, and not a single question at tonight's  about reproductive rights, paid leave, child care, or how we ensure women and families can succeed in America.We need a president who will prioritize these issues‚Äînot treat them as an afterthought.
It‚Äôs good that Democrats are having a robust debate about how we make health care a right for all. We should have single-payer as the end goal, and we need a real plan to get there.We have that transition plan. I‚Äôm the candidate who wrote it. 
Watching  night 1 with my team, in my new favorite t-shirt. 
You'll hear a lot of great ideas on the debate stages tonight and tomorrow night, but I'm the only candidate that takes on the big fights and wins, from passing the 9/11 health bill, to repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell. We need a nominee who doesn't know the meaning of impossible.

This is not a drill. We need to do everything we can to combat climate change. That means setting bold, ambitious goals‚Äîand fighting until we reach them: 
Whoever said running for president can't be fun? 
The fossil fuel industry has raked in billions in profits while exacerbating climate change and hurting communities. So when I'm president, when we undertake projects to deal with climate-related disasters, it'll be the oil and gas companies‚Äînot taxpayers‚Äîwho pay for them. 
Bravery is fighting for what's right‚Äîno matter what. and embody bravery to me, and they're running for Congress!We need strong women at every decision-making table. Will you split a donation to all three of our campaigns? 
Thank you, We're so lucky to have you on this team. 
After almost two decades of war, Americans understand the costs and consequences all too well‚Äîeven if Trump does not.As president, I will treat military force only as a last resort, only with a real strategy and achievable goals, and only when Congress provides legal authority. 
The scientific community is telling us that we only have a short amount of time to act on climate change if we're going to prevent the most catastrophic and irreversible damage in the future. My plan sets ambitious, transformative goals accordingly. 
Clean water should be a human right. I've passed legislation to address contamination of PFAS in drinking water, and as president, I'll work to remove these chemicals nationwide. 
Communities from Iowa to California to Puerto Rico are experiencing the effects of climate change. We can't just stay in the cycle of disaster and recovery‚Ää‚Äîwe have to reckon with the challenge we face, and take action with courage and determination. 
Sometimes, doing the right thing means doing the hard thing. We should do it anyway. 
Just like President Kennedy's moonshot, we should rise to the challenge of tackling climate change by setting ambitious goals. This is the greatest threat to humanity we‚Äôve ever faced, but we can‚Äôt react with fear‚Äîwe must be brave.  
America needs a new president and a new foreign policy‚Äîone that ends our endless wars, keeps our country safe, and restores our leadership on the world stage. I have a plan to do it. 
We're 200 days out from the New Hampshire primary! I've been so lucky to spend time with voters across the state, talking about the issues on their minds. Looking forward to continuing the conversation in the coming months!

Democracy is rooted in the principle that government belongs to people. In Puerto Rico and the diaspora, the people have spoken.Corruption and bigotry are poison in a democracy‚Äîand this shows that when we raise our voices together, we can defeat them. 
Climate change is the most serious threat to humanity that exists today. We need to take immediate and bold action before it‚Äôs too late. Here's my plan to do it as president: 
Our next commander in chief needs to take seriously all security threats‚Äîincluding attacks launched on a digital battlefield. Mueller was clear today: Russia interfered in our 2016 election, and they're already doing it again. We need a president who will hold them accountable. 
I‚Äôve served on Armed Services Committees for 12+ years. I believe that American leadership is indispensable around the world. And I know that President Trump makes us less safe.Today I shared how I'll approach our challenges as commander in chief: 
 The world needs America to live up to its tradition of stable leadership. It needs an America dedicated to peacefulness and diplomacy.   Our country deserves a new foreign policy‚Äîand a president who understands that leadership, integrity, and trust begin in the White House.
 Trump‚Äôs lack of response to Russia's attack on our democracy is shameful. I believe Congress should begin impeachment proceedings to get to the truth. And I‚Äôm pleased to hear that Mueller believes that the president can be charged for a crime after he leaves office.
 Our national security also includes online threats. It‚Äôs never been more clear that Russia took to the digital battlefield to attack the core of our democracy‚Äîand rather than stand strong for our country and our ideals, Trump and his associates welcomed aid from Russia.
 President Trump has politicized asylum seekers. Refugees leave their homes not because they want to, but because they have to. Supporting human and labor rights and addressing climate change will strike at the root causes of refugee flow, terrorist support, and instability.
 America is stronger when we work with our allies‚Äînot abandon them.Case in point: Trump‚Äôs tantrum on the nuclear agreement resulted in Iran beginning to enrich uranium again. As president, I will rejoin our allies in the JCPOA as long as Iran agrees to comply.
 We must end our endless wars. Military force should only be a last resort‚Äîonly used when diplomacy has failed. We must have clear, achievable goals where our tactics match the threat, and only when Congress provides the legal authority to send our men and women into harm‚Äôs way.
 As president, I will restore our standing on the world stage and improve our country‚Äôs national security.We must protect Americans with precision, technology, and a strategy that recognizes the threats of the 21st Century.
 I‚Äôll say this as loudly and clearly as I can: From his campaign‚Äôs conspiring with Russia to his reckless confrontation with Iran, the President of the United States is degrading our standing in the world and making us a less secure nation.
From unauthorized wars to terrorism and risk of a nuclear arms race, we face myriad global threats. Our own president shouldn't be one of them.We need real leadership and real strategy. Watch live as I speak on national security at 
Americans can disagree about a lot, but we should all be able to recognize that we can't afford four more years of Trump in the Situation Room.I will restore our standing on the world stage and keep us safe. That's what a president should do. 
The American people have a right to see the full, unredacted Mueller report. What we've seen already is alarming. No wonder President Trump is dead set on blocking the truth. That's why we need to start impeachment hearings. Add your name if you agree: 
It's time to start impeachment hearings.

Yelena Grigoryeva was listed as a target of anti-LGBTQ violence. Then she was found dead.Putin needs to be held accountable for the rampant persecution of LGBTQ people on his watch. And the U.S. president should defend human rights‚Äînot coddle dictators. 
The Senate did the right thing by passing the 9/11 first responders bill. I'm proud‚Äîbut this isn‚Äôt a victory. More heroes are going to get sick and die, and each one is a tragedy. But today, finally, their government stood by them.
For-profit prison companies are contracting with our government to lock up immigrants, immigration judges are reporting to Trump's DOJ, and bail amounts are skyrocketing. The system is functionally and morally broken. 
If we want to make health care a right, if we want to combat gun violence, if we want to take on fossil fuel companies and save our planet‚Äîwe need to get money out of politics first. 
Women won the 2018 election cycle. They organized, turned out to vote, ran, and won in record numbers. We should listen to women‚Äôs voices in our politics because they deserve to be heard‚Äîand we can‚Äôt win without them.

I am a person of faith, and I believe Republicans have distorted the conversation about Christianity in this country.President Trump is turning away people who are fleeing danger and need help. He's separating families and locking children up. That isn't Christian. It's evil.

Attacking something as basic and essential as Title X-funded health care shows the Trump administration will stop at nothing to try to control women's bodies. We need to fight like hell to protect access to reproductive health care. As president, I will. 
Hard to think of something more cowardly, cruel, and un-American than turning away people fleeing violence. This administration has no humanity.

I'm in Philly at to talk to this incredible group of organizers about how I'll stand up for our progressive values and defeat President Trump. Join us live: 
The threat of deportation raids has no real purpose except to terrify families and sow division. This is another racist attack on immigrants to distract from Trump's failures.For anyone who's scared: We won't stop fighting. For now, know your rights: 
The Trump administration's family separation policy is a stain on our country. Now, they're doubling down on their cruelty with their threat of raids.Every minute this crisis proceeds is an indictment on our humanity‚Äîand every one of us needs to refuse to comply.
It's hard to put into words what we're seeing our government do to immigrants. There can no longer be any doubt that this is a politically-driven crisis, a violation of human rights, and an atrocity. It has to stop. What more will it take?

What I saw today in Flint is a resilient community that's still fighting for clean water.Trump may have forgotten about the people of Flint, but I haven't‚Äîand I won't.  
Trump said he‚Äôd help Flint families‚Äîand he hasn't. Residents and activists have been left to fight for their community while his administration fails again and again to address the crisis.I‚Äôll listen to the families, and be the fierce fighter they need.  
 I‚Äôm incredibly thankful for the opportunity to hear speak today in Bloomfield Hills about reducing 
Today we visited Flint, MI. I had the chance to meet with Dr. whose research sounded the alarm on the water crisis, and we discussed Flint‚Äôs health, recovery efforts, and the need for continued support for this community. We can‚Äôt forget Flint, and I won‚Äôt. 
In Oakland County, MI, we talked about how we can combat gun violence, like having universal background checks and addressing the intersection of gun violence and domestic abuse.I'll be a president who treats gun violence like the health crisis it is:  
President Trump promised to do something about gun violence, but instead, he is actively standing in the way of common-sense reform.Every day, 100 Americans are killed with guns. We deserve a president who will do something about that‚Äîso here's my plan:  
Good riddance. 
Today in Youngstown, OH, a woman asked: "This is an area that, across all demographics, has been depressed because of the loss of industry and the opioid crisis. What do you have to say to people in this area about so-called white privilege?"Here's what I answered: 
This year, President Trump suggested cutting $25 billion from Social Security‚Äîafter promising that he wouldn‚Äôt cut programs like Social Security and Medicare.He lied. I don't. I met with voters in Cleveland to share how I'll strengthen Social Security:  
Social Security is more than an entitlement: It‚Äôs a benefit all Americans earn over their lifetimes.President Trump turned his back on seniors when he proposed budgets that gut Social Security. I'll protect and strengthen it:  
I went to Youngstown, Ohio today because I believe we need a president who will put workers first, and who will hold corporations accountable when they hurt working communities. The people I met here deserve nothing less.  
Nila works long, hard hours at UPMC, but she still struggles to make sure her sons have the health care they need.No one should be put in this position. We need a president who believes that health care is a right and not a privilege, and has a plan to make that happen.

President Trump promised workers that he would stop companies from shipping U.S. jobs overseas.Instead, he gave massive tax breaks to those companies‚Äîand did nothing when they gave huge bonuses to executives and outsourced jobs anyway.I'll fix it: 
At our Pittsburgh roundtable, we discussed one of our biggest health care crises: skyrocketing prescription drug prices. We need to take serious steps to hold drug companies accountable, get costs down, and make health care a right once and for all.  
This morning, I was in Pittsburgh talking about my plan to lower prescription drug prices. President Trump told voters he'd tackle this‚Äîand just this morning, he once again broke his promise. He's just not getting this done; I will. 
If your view of women is so backward in 2019 that you can‚Äôt be alone with a reporter doing her job, what the hell are you doing trying to be the governor of a whole state? 
Prescription drug prices are out of control. Hard-working Americans are having to choose between paying for their medication or keeping food on the table.Trump promised those prices would come down‚Äîand he failed to deliver. Here's how I'll get it done: 
I'm hitting the road today for our Trump Broken Promises bus tour! I'll be talking about some of the  issues he's failed to deliver on‚Äîand my plans to fix them.Two days, three states, six stops. Follow along on our live blog, starting in Pittsburgh:

President Trump didn't "drain the swamp." He filled it with people just like him. And I'm ready to bring Washington the reform it desperately needs. 
Working families aren't just losing jobs‚Äîtheir lives are being upended by changing industries. We have to confront these shifts with new ideas to train and support workers for the future. 
These arcane policies don‚Äôt make any community safer, and they aren‚Äôt justice. They just reinforce a system that keeps poor people in jail while wealthier people walk free. We need to end cash bail. 
President Trump told voters he'd tackle the issues that keep them up at night, from prescription drug prices and job loss to gun safety and Social Security. He's failed to deliver. I won't.He makes promises. I'll make progress. 
Gov. Sununu thinks being able to care for loved ones without losing a paycheck is a joke. We're not laughing. He deserves to lose his job.

There are few crimes more horrendous than sexual violence against minors‚Äîand enabling that kind of predatory behavior is disgusting. I voted against Alex Acosta's nomination because he should never have been in a position of power in the first place. He needs to resign now.
President Trump has broken a lot of promises. Working families are struggling, and he's failed to deliver solutions. I won't.Today we released our first TV ad, and we're making sure voters in states that Trump won see it. Help keep it on the air:  
At the debates last month, the candidates were asked how we'd deal with Mitch McConnell if we're elected president. Here‚Äôs one solution: We replace him. I'm proud to endorse for U.S. Senate. Let's win this fight‚Äîsupport her campaign now:  
I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll say it again: President Trump, and every member of his administration responsible for the abuses committed against immigrant families, must be held accountable. I refuse to accept another year-plus of children traumatized at our government‚Äôs hands.
A year ago today, I visited a Brownsville, TX detention facility housing over 1,400 migrant children in prison-like conditions. Since then, the crisis created by Trump‚Äôs inhumane policy has gotten worse‚Äîand his administration still has no plan to reunite many of these families.
The incessant attacks on the ACA put millions of Americans at risk of losing health care. We need to protect the ACA, and then truly make health care a human right‚Äîstarting with an option to buy into Medicare, and with single-payer as the end goal. 
When women have a seat at the table, America wins.

We need to get money out of politics. The health of our democracy depends on it. 
All of the progressive plans and ideas we're discussing in this primary depend on getting money out of politics. We need clean elections to restore power to people in our democracy. 
Team Gillibrand knows how to rock a parade. Hope everyone had an awesome time celebrating Independence Day!  
We need a president who's brave enough to lead by doing the right thing‚Äîeven when it's hard, even when it's inconvenient. Because that's what leaders do. 
Democracy only works if we all participate. We should be making it easier for Americans to make their voices heard‚Äînot harder. We need automatic voter registration for every eligible 18-year-old.

The Trump administration's assault on reproductive health care isn't just affecting the US‚Äîit's also harming people all over the world. We need a president who knows that reproductive rights are human rights. 
 ‚ÄúIt is mind-boggling to me that we are still debating whether women should have access to reproductive rights. We have to start‚Ä¶
We're facing two crises: climate change, and a failure of leadership.
Here's an idea: Cancel this rule altogether, and don't give health care providers the ability to discriminate at all. 
Madam President. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? 
My grandmother organized women in local campaigns at a time when women weren't supposed to have power.My mother was one of only three women in her law school class.They taught me that if there isn't a space for you, you should make your own.

When families succeed, they can give their children a chance to do even better. That's the central principle of my Family Bill of Rights: We can help level the playing field for all kids by making it easier and more affordable to raise them:  
I'm proud to lead the 2020 field on reproductive rights, tackling Washington corruption, and standing up to Trump in the Senate. It was exhilarating getting to share what I'm fighting for in the first debate. Can't wait to do it again in the next one. 
Abandoning the Iran nuclear deal was reckless and dangerous. We need to return to the agreement, strengthen it, and bring Iran back into compliance. President Trump‚Äôs foreign policy is a national security risk.
At the first debate, I proved that no one will fight harder for women and families than me. That's why we need to make sure I'm in the next round of debates in the fall. Can you chip in before the FEC deadline at midnight to help secure my spot? 
I believe that years from now, we'll look back on this moment in our history, and we‚Äôll be able to say that we took action to change what's so deeply wrong with the status quo. Because when we stand together to drive out darkness, hope rises. Fear loses. And  
Thirty state legislatures are working to restrict abortion access and challenge Roe v. Wade. The next president needs to realize the stakes of this fight and be ready not just to defend reproductive rights, but to lead the fight for them.

This is racism. It was wrong before, and it‚Äôs wrong now. We won‚Äôt allow it again. 
We need a president who will take on the biggest fights we face‚Äîeven if she stands alone. 
The Hyde Amendment is the result of negotiations and compromises struck on the backs of women.  Everyone in America should have access to safe and legal abortion. When I'm at that negotiation table, I won‚Äôt compromise on our rights.  
If we're only ever on defense, we're losing. It‚Äôs time to fight for reproductive rights, and fight to win. 
A true American hero who fought till the end. Rest in peace, Lou. We can never thank you enough for your service and your bravery.My heart is with all his loved ones.

Climate change is the single greatest threat to humanity that exists today, and it will take a bold approach to even begin solving it. We can‚Äôt afford half-steps‚Äîthe Green New Deal should be our moonshot. 
Reproductive rights are nonnegotiable. Period.  
Women deserve a president who won‚Äôt just defend their rights, but one who will lead the fight for them. Kirsten was the first 2020 candidate to put out a comprehensive reproductive rights agenda and vow to only appoint judges who‚Äôd uphold Roe.  
When we defeat Donald Trump, and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office‚Äîwho do you want in that negotiating room?Kirsten has been fighting fiercely for women‚Äôs rights for a decade. When that door closes, she'll never compromise on women‚Äôs reproductive freedom. 
Special interests are at the root of almost all of our biggest problems right now‚Äîgun violence, climate change, unaffordable health care. We need to shut them out and put the power in our democracy back where it belongs: with the people.  
A Clean Elections plan is how we make all of our other plans possible. Here's how it works ‚§µÔ∏è  
Correct.  
We should not be spending money on for-profit prisons to lock up children and asylum-seekers.  
Donald Trump‚Äôs administration demonizing and mistreating asylum-seekers and funneling security funds into for-profit prisons doesn‚Äôt make us safe. 
 
Let‚Äôs not mince words: Separating children from their families in order to punish them for seeking a better life is cruel. This has to end. 
Immigrants and those seeking asylum should have access to lawyers, not cages. People coming to our country should be met with compassion, not walls. 
We desperately need compassionate, humane immigration reform in this country. It starts with a pathway to citizenship. 
Health care should be a right, not a privilege. That‚Äôs why Kirsten supports Medicare for All‚Äîand has since 2005.  
We need to create a public option to let people buy in to Medicare for All at a cost they can afford. That‚Äôs how we transition from our current system to single-payer.  
A throwback to Kirsten arguing for a Medicare for All health care plan‚Äîin 2006.  
 ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre talking about ending gun violence, it‚Äôs the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that makes any progress im‚Ä¶
You‚Äôll hear a lot of progressive ideas tonight. But we‚Äôll never get them done if we can‚Äôt get the corrupting influence of money out of politics and break Washington gridlock. Kirsten‚Äôs Clean Elections plan would do it:  
Our economy is not an even playing field. Kids fall back because of their socioeconomic status, race, and zip code, before they enter kindergarten. Kirsten's economic agenda centers on families and addresses institutional inequities. 
We're one of the richest countries in the world. To withhold health care from those who can't afford it is shameful. It's long past time for Medicare for All. 
Hey everyone! Team Gillibrand here. üëã Kirsten is about to take to the  stage, and we're so excited to cheer her on. Make sure you tune in and follow along with our live updates here!

We deserve better than cowardice in the White House. Let's be brave.  
I'm getting ready for the debate tonight, and I can't wait to share my vision with the whole country.With higher thresholds for the next debates, I need to hit 130,000 donors so I can keep lifting up the issues you care about. Can you be one of them?  
I come from a line of strong, outspoken women. They raised me with the belief that bravery isn't just about standing up for yourself‚Äîit's about standing up for people who need you. Here's a little more of what they taught me. 
"A pledge that Gillibrand made earlier this year‚Äîto only nominate judges who commit to backing Roe v. Wade‚Äîhas set the standard for nearly every other 2020 Democrat, most of whom have followed suit."And I'm glad it did. 
When I started this campaign, I said I'd fight for every family as hard as I fight for my own. And when it's your family, you don't settle for half-steps. You dig deep and act boldly.When it comes to making the future better for families, I will fight. And I fight to win. 
I'm looking forward to sharing my plans, where I stand on issues, and what I'll do as president on the  stage tonight‚Äîbut if you want a refresher, text ISSUES to 60980! 
We deserve a leader who will take on the fights no one else will. Someone who's brave enough to stand up for what's right, even when it's hard. Even when she stands alone.That's what I do, and that's why I'm running.

Good. The citizenship question is intended solely to instill fear in immigrant communities. There‚Äôs absolutely no need to include it in the census.

Can‚Äôt wait to be on the debate stage tomorrow night, making sure the issues I‚Äôm fighting for get the attention they deserve.See you tomorrow at 9 pm. 
I was the first‚Äîand still, one of the only‚Äî2020 candidates to release a comprehensive LGBTQ rights agenda, because LGBTQ rights are human rights.  
We can't stop climate change unless we take bold action and put a price on carbon. It doesn't matter what President Trump or anyone else says‚Äîsaving our planet, creating green jobs, and protecting clean air and water should be bipartisan and a no-brainer. 
Gun violence is an epidemic in this country‚Äîbut we can‚Äôt end it unless we get money out of politics. Elected officials should answer only to the people they represent, not the NRA and its greed. 
Seeking asylum is not a crime. 
President Trump‚Äôs treatment of immigrants is inhumane and appalling. Separating families and detaining kids in horrifying conditions doesn‚Äôt make anyone safer. We need comprehensive immigration reform. 
All of the Democrats running support reproductive rights, but the next president needs a plan to codify Roe v. Wade and protect access everywhere. That‚Äôs why I was the first candidate to put out a comprehensive reproductive rights agenda:  
Health care should be a human right‚Äîperiod. But to make Medicare for All a reality, the next president needs to be brave enough to take on the insurance companies, create competition, and get costs down. I‚Äôll fight for it as president just like I have done since 2006. 
It's almost here: I'm fired up to take the debate stage tomorrow at 9 pm ET and hope you'll tune in! Join one of our watch parties happening all over the country: 
Leaders take on tough fights and get things done‚Äîno matter who they're up against, and even if it means standing alone. We need a leader. 
Families across America are struggling to make ends meet, and their children are being held back as a result.That's why in my first hundred days as president, I'll pass a Family Bill of Rights to make sure every kid has a chance to succeed: 
We all need to do whatever we can to stop this administration's abuse of immigrants. I've visited detention centers in TX and NY, and on Friday, I'm going to Homestead. We've got to speak up and show up until we 
Four years ago today, the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in Obergefell v. Hodges made marriage equality the law of the land.As we continue fighting for LGBTQ rights, we‚Äôll be standing on the shoulders of countless brave advocates who got us this far. Let‚Äôs keep going.  
It's essential that our next president have a bold vision for this country‚Äîbut none of it will be possible until we get money out of politics.My Clean Elections Plan will put power into the hands of people‚Äîand let us finally make the progress we need.  
I always knew I wanted to do public service, but as a little girl, it didn‚Äôt always seem within reach. There weren‚Äôt as many women running for office then.Today, I‚Äôm running for president of the United States. And I hope little girls know that someday, they can, too. 
Getting everyone ready before the debate in Miami! 
I have a long history of taking on big fights in the Senate‚Äîeven when I stand alone‚Äîand getting things done. That‚Äôs exactly what I will do as president. And if it means going toe-to-toe with President Trump, even better.The time for being polite is over. 
This president's misogyny is disqualifying. Women deserve better.I believe E. Jean. 
This is the bare minimum. This administration's appalling mistreatment of immigrant children has to stop, and every person responsible for it should resign‚Äîincluding President Trump. 
Tanya inspires me. She and the thousands of transgender service members who've served our country are braver than this president will ever be. 
The coordinated assault on reproductive freedom has been underway for years, and it's about one thing: undermining women's bodily autonomy.We must be unequivocal in standing up for our civil rights. That includes electing a new president who will fight for them, no matter what. 
LGBTQ rights are human rights. I've been fighting for them since I was first elected to Congress‚Äîand I'm not about to stop now. 
Children are being subjected to inhumane conditions because of a crisis President Trump created. He needs to fix it.

This is not up for debate. We are talking about children. Human beings. These conditions are unacceptable. 
Too often, politicians just don't listen to the people who are most affected by the policies they create. Thank you, Laurie, for sharing your story with me.Bodily autonomy is a fundamental human right. That's why we have to fight for everyone's ability to exercise it. 
This election is a chance to stand up for our values‚Äîfrom protecting civil rights to making the economy work for all of us. Now is not the time to be silent.If this weekend is any indication, we're going to make our voices heard loud and clear. Thank you, South Carolina! 
President Trump and legislatures across the country have launched an all-out assault on our reproductive rights. We need a president who understands how serious this is‚Äîand is ready to fight like hell against it. 
Ran into a few friends in South Carolina this weekend. Thanks for an amazing fish fry, 
Thank YOU for your leadership. We‚Äôre going to win this fight for reproductive rights for all. 
Reproductive health care is health care, and access to it must not only be protected, but increased for all people‚Äîno matter who they are or where they live.We need a president who will fight for these basic human rights. Thank you for helping make sure of it.

Between his historic foreign policy blunders, dangerous statements, and military escalation in the region, I'm deeply concerned that President Trump could drag us into a war with Iran. This is not a game.
President Trump inherited an Iran whose nuclear ambitions were constrained by international agreement. He destroyed the impact of that agreement. He has undermined the international coalition safeguarding against Iran building a nuclear weapon.He is endangering us all.
Yesterday I sent a letter to the president demanding that he not heedlessly launch us into another unnecessary and unauthorized war.We're still in Afghanistan. The Iraq War's cheerleader is now our top national security official. We should be ending wars‚Äînot starting new ones.
Few things make President Trump's recklessness clearer‚Äîor more alarming‚Äîthan what happened last night.Let's set this straight right now: The president must not start a war without congressional approval. He is risking lives and making America less safe.

We can't settle for half-steps on marijuana legalization. If we don't expunge marijuana records and specifically support the communities who've been most hurt by the war on drugs, it's not true justice. 
This perfectly summarizes this president's legacy: protecting an industry that has caused severe environmental health problems, instead of protecting our planet. 
The Trump administration's Title X gag rule will deny access to basic reproductive health care for millions of people. I call that a violation of human rights. We will fight back. 
Thanks for having me, I love a good conversation about women getting off the sidelines‚Äîwhether it's in politics or starting a small business. (And happy to have found a birthday twin, ü§ó)

Lou, you are a hero and a fighter, and my heart is with you. this is why "waiting until the last minute" to give 9/11 first responders the support they deserve doesn't cut it. 
The U.S. government shouldn't be in the business of separating families in the first place‚Äîbut it especially shouldn't fund detention centers that mistreat children.Vulnerable kids aren't political pawns. Congress needs to hold the president accountable. 
On Juneteenth, we celebrate emancipation‚Äîbut we must also acknowledge the shadow slavery still casts.We can't change our past, but we must keep working toward a more just future: starting with finally studying reparations, ending mass incarceration, and enacting postal banking.
We can't afford four more years with a misogynist in the White House. Imagine what we could achieve with a working mother as president instead.Chip in and let's do this: 
Just a reminder:Donald Trump is a coward.He is a misogynist.He has torn apart the moral fabric of this country.And I believe his kryptonite is a strong woman who can‚Äôt be silenced. 
Tonight, Donald Trump officially begins his campaign for a second term as president. He wants us to think he's strong, but the truth is, he is a coward. We deserve better. 
I will never back down in the fight for what's right‚Äîno matter who I have to go up against. I'm proud to have voted against the Trump agenda more than anyone else in the Senate or the 2020 field.  
36 years ago, Sally Ride became the first American woman to go to space, and paved the way for many more to follow her lead. Grateful to her for proving that with bravery, not even the sky is the limit. 
Thank you, Jon.Let's do right by our 9/11 first responders and permanently fund the Victim Compensation Fund, once and for all. 
This president doesn't value women. Let's replace him with one who does.

"The nation must endure another 1¬Ω years of Trump. But it needn‚Äôt suffer another four beyond that. We can do better."  couldn't agree more. 
LGBTQ people deserve to live, work, raise families, and succeed just like anyone else‚Ää. And they deserve a president who'll fight for that truth. 
Don't get me wrong, I love being on the campaign trail. But there's no place like home with Maple. 
A four-month-old.This baby, and this family, will suffer from this trauma‚Äîcaused entirely by this administration‚Äîfor the rest of their lives. We can't become numb to this.
We must honor the nine people murdered at Emanuel AME four years ago today with action, not just words. We need to reject white supremacy, wherever we see it, and end gun violence‚Äîstarting with closing the Charleston loophole.  
Our democracy is built on the principle of one person, one vote. Racial gerrymandering dilutes the voting power of people of color.This is good news from the Supreme Court. Now let's focus on redistricting reform to ensure voting rights.
Thank you, Kristyn‚Äîyour endorsement means the world to me. So proud to have you on our team in New Hampshire! 
Anyone who questions whether women can determine this election wasn't paying attention in 2018, and they certainly aren't seeing how fired up women are right now. Thank you for three empowering, inspiring days, 
When I was little, I'd help my grandmother volunteer for Democrats. She was so powerful‚Äîtaking action to make a difference. I wanted to be JUST like her.She showed me that women's voices matter. That's why I entered public service, and it's why I'm running for president.

Paid family leave isn‚Äôt just an economic issue or a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issue‚Äù‚Äîit should be part of the conversation we have around health care in this country. Thank you for the great discussion this morning. 
When DACA was created seven years ago today, we made a promise to Dreamers who work hard and have only ever called America home. Breaking that promise is one of many cowardly things this president has done.Let's be brave. Let's keep our promise and create a path to citizenship.

With this marijuana legalization plan, we can start working to not only heal the damage done by racist drug laws, but tap into the medical and economic opportunity that marijuana offers. 
Gun violence is an epidemic in this country, but it doesn't have to be. We could change it if elected officials were brave enough to stand up to the NRA.On  we must commit to keep up the fight to end gun violence. The stakes are too high not to. 
This is horrendous. 
Too many families are struggling to make ends meet, and children are being held back as a result. Guaranteeing the right to affordable child care and early education will not only help parents financially, but it will level the playing field for kids‚Äîno matter where they're from. 
Trump may think this is a game, but these are people's lives we're talking about. And he's hurting them. We must protect and strengthen programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security‚Äînot make debilitating cuts to their funding. 
Nothing proposed today can ever undo the devastating harm done to generations of communities of color by the War on Drugs. But it‚Äôs long past time to start making this right.It's time to legalize marijuana nationwide. 
It's simple, really.
I've met a lot of bold, brave little girls on the campaign trail so far, and I love hearing about their big dreams. I met one who wants to publish a book she wrote, one who wants to be a teacher, and yes‚Äîone who wants to run for president (in 2052).

With my national marijuana legalization plan, we can begin to dismantle the institutional racism in our criminal justice system, open up important new medical and economic horizons, and lift up communities who need and deserve a fair shot at opportunity. 
A state-by-state patchwork isn't enough to tackle the deeply rooted racial, social, and economic injustices within our marijuana laws, or to unleash the economic equity and opportunity of marijuana legalization. Let's fully legalize marijuana nationwide.  
Thank you, You're right: Marijuana legalization is not only about criminal justice, but economic justice. We will start to make this right and give people the chance to take back the years that racist drug laws stole from them.

Under my plan, we'll decriminalize marijuana and expunge all non-violent marijuana charges, expand access to medical marijuana, nationally legalize and tax recreational marijuana, and create economic equity and justice through marijuana-driven programs. It's 2019. It's time. 
Marijuana legalization is a criminal justice issue, a health care issue, and an economic issue. It's past time to make this happen at the federal level. Here's my plan to do it:

The power in our democracy belongs in the hands of the people, not politicians and special interests. Voters should know their leaders work for them. Proud to have signed and pledge to support fair redistricting and end gerrymandering. 
I called Fox News out for its lies about abortion because they're actively participating in the Republican Party's assault on reproductive health care. I'll be polite about it when extremists stop attacking our human rights.

We make up more than half of the population. If we had more seats at the table, do you think we'd still be fighting over women's human rights?  Me neither. 
The NRA is lying to the American people. The chokehold they have on our laws is not about the Second Amendment. It is about gun sales. It is about greed and corruption. It is about making sure the status quo‚Äîthousands dying every year‚Äîstays the same. 
Ever been told you're not "polite?" We have something for you:  
California is the fifth-largest economy in the world, but ranks 41st in the country in per-pupil funding for education. Tomorrow, Los Angeles residents have the opportunity to stand up and change that. to help end the public education funding crisis. 
I said I'd go anywhere and take on anyone to stand up for what is right. And I meant it. 
Right now, we have a president who does whatever he feels is most convenient and profitable‚Äîfor himself.We deserve better. 
I'm never going to stop fighting for women and for our progressive values‚Äîwhether or not it's considered "polite." That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for president. 
The nationwide assault on women‚Äôs reproductive rights is powered by Donald Trump and Fox News propaganda. Tonight, I said so. 
I believe we can fix what's broken in America, if we're brave. That's what I'll do as president‚Äîand that's what I told the audience at my town hall in Iowa tonight.If you want to hear more, donate to help secure my spot at the debate:  
What about men's seat at the table?  
As president, I will fight for every single American‚Äîno matter who they are, where they live, or what their party affiliation. If you liked what you heard tonight at my  help guarantee my spot on the debate stage: 
Donald Trump has degraded our democracy and ripped apart the moral fabric of our country. In moments like this, I believe we're all called to take on the tough fights‚Äîeven if they are hard. Especially if they are hard.  That's what I'll do as president. 
I fully support border security, and so do Democrats. But what President Trump is doing at our border is not making us safer‚Äîit's immoral, it's inhumane, and it's unacceptable. We need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. 
As with so many issues, President Trump doesn't have a real plan when it comes to trade, tariffs, or the economy. He's hurting farmers and manufacturers.Americans need a strategy‚Äînot a tantrum. 
So many Americans are being left behind in our policies because they aren't represented in our politics. We need to bring more people to the table and lift up voices that haven't been heard. 
I'm going to be very clear: Reproductive rights are human rights, and they are nonnegotiable. That's why as president I will codify Roe v. Wade, which 70% of Americans support, and only appoint judges who will uphold it as a constitutional right. 
Why is it that too many of our leaders don't have the guts to stop gun violence? Simple: because they're bought and paid for by the NRA. That's why I'll take them on, and fight for publicly funded elections. And yes: I'm proud of my "F" rating from the NRA. 
The NRA cares more about gun industry profits than human lives. We need to stand up to their greed not only by fighting for policies like background checks, an assault weapons ban, and anti-trafficking measures, but also by getting money out of our politics. 
The decision about if and when to start a family should be made by a woman and her doctor. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve pledged that as president, I will ONLY nominate judges‚Äîincluding Supreme Court justices‚Äîwho will commit to upholding Roe v. Wade. If you agree, I need you to chip in $1.

Your administration has:‚ùåDemonized transgender service members‚ùåAllowed discrimination against LGBTQ kids, parents, and homeless people‚ùåCozied up to anti-LGBTQ foreign leadersLGBTQ Americans deserve a champion. All they have in you is a cowardly, bigoted bully. 
I see the pain of families who desperately want to raise a child but are denied adoption because of their sexual orientation, or they lack access to fertility treatments because they can't afford them. And it's not right. That's why I have a plan to change it. 
Good. 
Dr. George Tiller‚Äôs murder is a painful reminder of how much abortion providers put on the line to trust women and ensure patients have access to the safe, compassionate health care they need. We need to protect them‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot defund, silence, criminalize, or endanger them. 
I'm grateful to these brave Iowa women for sharing their stories and reminding us what's at stake with Roe on the line. Criminalizing abortion doesn't end abortion; it just makes the people seeking it less safe. We cannot and will not go back.

Robert Mueller made himself clear: He expects Congress to exercise its constitutional authority to finish what he couldn't.We need to begin impeachment hearings. Add your name if you agree: 
The White House has repeatedly stonewalled Congress' ability to take basic fact-finding steps and make an informed decision. That fact, combined with Mueller's clear message today, tells me that Republicans and Democrats should begin impeachment hearings.
From the beginning, I've called for a proper process in order to secure key testimony and information related to the Mueller investigation, so that Congress can fulfill its responsibility to deliver the truth to the American people.
It's time for Congress to begin impeachment hearings and follow the facts. Robert Mueller clearly expects Congress to exercise its constitutional authority and take steps that he could not. We can't let the president defy basic accountability measures built into our Constitution.
Let's call Senator McConnell's behavior what it is: hypocrisy and abuse of power. Someone who takes our democracy and millions of Americans' lives so lightly has has no business leading the Senate. In 2020, we should relieve him of that leadership.

Determining whether children have a fair shot in life isn't a "women's issue." That's why it's the core of my economic policy agenda. 
This president is more ruthless toward transgender Americans than he is to any actual adversary. His agenda is nothing but hate and hurt toward the most marginalized among us. What a disgrace. 
Families and kids face huge disparities in opportunity depending on their income and zip code, and the gap is wider for families of color. It isn‚Äôt fair or acceptable.  We need to level the playing field in the first, critical years of a child‚Äôs life. 
I believe these two things:1. We should make it easier to raise a family in America.2. Fighting for families should be the number one concern of the president of the United States. 
Carlos Hernandez V√°squez.Jakelin Caal Maquin.Felipe G√≥mez Alonzo. Juan de Le√≥n Guti√©rrez. And two more children who died after crossing our border.Six children. Some in our government‚Äôs hands. We can‚Äôt let them be forgotten, and we can‚Äôt accept this atrocity. 
It takes bravery to come out of the closet. It takes even more to throw open the doors and lead the way for thousands to come behind you. On  let's honor his visionary leadership by building a world where everybody can live authentically, freely, and equally.

The president is waging a war on America's women. And he will lose. 
Democracy doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúfor some of us.‚Äù It‚Äôs time for Washington, DC to have statehood and equal representation in Congress, and we should only need a simple majority to make it happen. 
The LGBTQ community deserves more in a president than a bigoted coward who spews hate every chance he gets. You deserve a president who will stand up not only to that bigotry, but also to the special interests that prevent us from making progress on civil rights.

There's a reason I went to Georgia to speak out against these horrific abortion bans, and there's a reason I made a plan to protect reproductive rights before that: This has always been a priority to me. And it will be one as president, too. 
To every person experiencing a pregnancy you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to carry: Only you know the best decision for you. You owe nobody an explanation‚Äîespecially not politicians.Abortion is still a constitutional right, and we‚Äôll make sure it stays that way. 
The right to abortion is the fundamental human right to make decisions about your own body, no exceptions, no matter what. Any leader who doesn't support and defend that principle‚Äîwhatever their personal beliefs‚Äîis undermining women's civil rights, and I don't accept that. 
What we're seeing from the president and in states across the country is an assault on reproductive rights. But we saw in Georgia exactly how we're going to win this fight: Side by side, lifting each other up. We know what's at stake, and we won't lose.  
It's sure been a week‚Äîbut we're not backing down. Get your brand-new shirt and let's keep fighting:  
Bravery isn't always easy. Bravery is making a choice to do things differently‚Äîeven when people tell you it can't be done, simply because it never has been. It's on us to decide we're up to the challenge of doing it anyway.

Women have been fighting this same fight for our human rights for decades. I know it can be exhausting. But we cannot give up. Not then, not now, not ever.We stand on the shoulders of those who fought before us. We can win if we join together. Now‚Äôs our time to fight.

This is exactly why I made a promise to only appoint judges and justices who will commit to upholding Roe v. Wade. This isn't a matter of "what if" anymore; our rights are under attack, and our response is either head-on or it's not enough.I'm ready to fight. 
President Trump's Supreme Court nominees said they respected precedent.I don't believe them. It's the Republican Party's goal to overturn Roe v. Wade, and they've shown they'll stop at nothing to do it.Now it's on us to stop at nothing to fight back. 
We're facing an all-out assault on women‚Äôs constitutional rights, explicitly aimed at overturning Roe v. Wade. We need to loudly proclaim that reproductive rights are nonnegotiable, and join together to defend them at every level‚Äîin Washington, in the courts, and in the states.
Right now, the conversation about what women can do with our own bodies is being driven by too many male politicians. It should be led by the actual experts: women and doctors. So I'm going to hear from the people most directly affected by abortion bans like Georgia's.

Alabama. Georgia. Mississippi. Kentucky. Ohio. The assault on on reproductive rights is happening across the country, and we have to step up our fight to stop them. Together.We need to focus our attention and our efforts where the attacks start: in the states. Stay tuned.
For politicians who claim to care so much about humanity, they don‚Äôt have much of it. 
Roe v. Wade is at greater risk right now than it has ever been. If Democrats are truly the party that protects reproductive health care and women's humanity, we have to fight back hard, on every front. We cannot turn back the clock. 
Alabama will likely pass a near-total abortion ban today, joining Mississippi and Georgia. Louisiana is next. If this feels like a ruthless, coordinated assault on reproductive rights, that's because it is.State elections matter.

Making change requires being brave enough to break the mold. In light of graduation season, my wish for all the new graduates across this country is that each of you does just that: Use your voice. Break the mold. Choose brave. We'll all be better for it. 
In one of the wealthiest countries in the world, the guarantee of clean water for every family should not be a radical concept. With a Green New Deal and a president who cares about people more than lining polluters' pockets, we can make it happen. 
Take sexual assault cases out of the military chain of command. 
We need to combat maternal mortality and the racial health care disparities that are killing black moms at higher rates than anyone else. Valuing and loving mothers should not come with an asterisk. 
To the mothers who have yet to be reunited with their children after being separated at the border, mothers whose children were taken by gun violence or illness, mothers who‚Äôve lost a child or children who‚Äôve lost their mothers:I‚Äôm holding you in my heart‚Äîtoday and always.
A Mother's Day reminder: Paid leave isn't a women's issue, a moms' issue, or even just a parents' issue. Everyone deserves to be able to take time to care for a family member or medical issue. 
I‚Äôm thankful every day to have my mom, and to be one. To all of the strong and loving moms and mother figures: Happy Mother‚Äôs Day! 
Our farmers, rural businesses, and working families shouldn't have to pay the price for President Trump's continued chaos in trade negotiations. China needs to be held accountable for greedy trade practices, but Americans deserve a strategy‚Äînot a tantrum.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to break the mold if it needs to be broken.Congratulations, class of 2019!

What is happening in Georgia and Alabama should be a wake-up call on reproductive rights for the entire country. Extreme politicians are putting women's lives in danger. If we aren't taking serious steps to fight back, we're not paying enough attention.

It takes real bravery to change a conversation. Thank you, for speaking out about a universal truth: Women and doctors, not politicians, know what is best for their own health and lives.  
Yesterday I announced that I will only nominate judges‚Ää who will protect Roe v. Wade‚Äîbut defending our courts is only one front in the fight for reproductive rights. The next president needs to prioritize, champion, and expand them. Here are my priorities: 
 Every Democratic candidate rails against Citizens United. Kirsten Gillibrand actually has a plan. 
I‚Äôm the first 2020 candidate who has pledged to ONLY nominate judges who will commit to upholding Roe v. Wade as settled law. Will you chip in $1 to ensure a strong voice for reproductive freedom is on the Democratic debate stage?
It's clear that a lack of respect for our Constitution is contagious in the Trump White House. We shouldn't have to ask our president or any of his lackeys to stop hiding the truth from the American people, but here we are. Congress needs the full Mueller report, now.
The decision about if and when to start a family should be made by a woman and her doctor. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve pledged that as president, I will ONLY nominate judges‚Äîincluding Supreme Court justices‚Äîwho will commit to upholding Roe v. Wade. If you agree, I need you to chip in $1.
A note to the Republican politicians trying to return to a time when women had no say about what happened to our bodies or lives: We aren‚Äôt going back. 
 ‚ÄúWe have all it takes to compete. If taxpayer money is being spent, it should be used to support good American jobs.‚Äù‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs been a year since the Trump administration began ripping babies from parents and throwing children in cages at the border. Many families are still separated. We won't rest  and the people behind this cruelty are held accountable. 
We're facing an unprecedented Republican assault on abortion access in states across the country. The judiciary is one of the most crucial lines of defense, and the next president needs to make sure judges will uphold‚Äînot undermine‚Äîwomen's constitutional rights. I will. 
From Kavanaugh to state abortion bans‚Äîincluding the one signed today in Georgia‚ÄîRepublicans are waging a coordinated assault to overturn Roe v. Wade. We need a president who understands the real stakes of this fight, and who's willing to draw a line.

 ICYMI: Read more about Clean Elections plan -- a proposal to get Big Money out of politics and give powe‚Ä¶
We've seen the corrupting force money plays in politics. My Clean Elections Plan will give power back to everyday Americans and ensure our elected officials are actually fighting for the people they represent. 
I‚Äôve voted against President Trump‚Äôs cabinet and administration picks (including John Kelly in 2017) more than any other Senator. Why? Because they weren‚Äôt fit for the job‚Äîjust like the president who appointed them.  
Today in Texas, a disability rights activist asked me what I would do to meet standards of inclusion. I've committed to having someone with disabilities in my Cabinet, because I want to get this right. Accessibility and inclusion are issues I'll take on with urgency and care.
Right now, most of the money in our politics comes from a small group of mostly white, mostly older men. My Clean Elections Plan would amplify more voices, like a similar program did in Seattle. When we bring more people to the table, our government works better for all of us. 
I was honored to have at our campaign kickoff. She's a DREAMer, an advocate for immigrants and women, and now she's headed to graduate school. We need more brave leaders like her‚Äîif you can, please chip in to support her dreams: 
Representing Iowans means ALL Iowans. Signing this bill and widening health care disparities doesn‚Äôt make a leader, it makes her a bully. 
If Kirsten makes this shot, will you donate $1 to guarantee her spot on the debate stage? 
Congratulations,  
If we want working families to thrive, we must take every opportunity to support workers and their right to collectively bargain for better wages and benefits. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, and I urge Congress to pass it.
Can we have a good time *and* talk about the issues people care about? Absolutely. Thanks for a great event 
This is immoral, un-American, and will hurt millions of women and transgender people. Religious freedom doesn't give anyone the right to deny health care. 
If we want to change the way Washington works‚Äîor make it work at all‚Äîwe have to get big money out of politics. My Clean Elections Plan is designed to do just that by making every American's voice just as powerful as the Koch brothers':  
What she said. 
The gratitude is mutual, 
On this  we must face the reality that not everyone is safe in their house of worship. America is supposed to welcome all people, regardless of faith. My prayer is that we can restore our moral fabric, reject hate, and live up to who we're supposed to be.
We need a president who's brave enough to take on corruption in Washington. Americans have lost faith in our democracy because elected officials are more beholden to big donors and special interests than they are to the people.My Clean Elections Plan would change that. 
There are just under 60 days until the first presidential debates. If you want Kirsten on that stage, we need to add 500 donors by midnight tomorrow to stay on track. Will you chip in $1?
If Kirsten makes this shot, will you donate $1 to guarantee her spot on the debate stage?
With 21(!) declared candidates in this race, the DNC may limit the list of debate participants based on who does and doesn‚Äôt have 65,000 individual donors to their campaign. Kirsten needs your help! Will you chip in $1 before midnight to guarantee her spot on the debate stage?

My Clean Elections Plan would flip our current political system on its head‚Äîempowering more women, young people, and people of color to have a say in our government and set our course for a more equal and just future. 
Thirty-eight percent. This is unacceptable, and I‚Äôm tired of excuses from the Pentagon. They are failing our service members and have proven they can‚Äôt fix this.My bill would. We need the Military Justice Improvement Act now.
I'll go anywhere, any time, to make the case for progressive policies that will make life better for American families. Looking forward to my town hall in Iowa with Chris Wallace.

I've been concerned about AG Barr since his nomination, which is why I voted against it. After yesterday's hearing, there's no question that he's more focused on representing the president than the American people. It's an embarrassment to his office and he should resign. 
By eliminating a current taxpayer subsidy for excessive CEO compensation‚Äî25 times the median salary of their employees, or more than $1 million‚Äîwe'd fully fund my Clean Elections Plan and then some. That's leveling the playing field in more ways than one. 
It's clear the Trump Administration will stop at nothing to take health care away from tens of millions of Americans and end coverage for pre-existing conditions. We have to vote like our lives depend on it‚Äîbecause for many families, they do. 
Labor movements all over the world have given us the hard-fought rights workers have today‚Äîand with those rights under attack more than ever, we have to hold that line. This  let's keep up the fight for strong unions and a strong middle class.
We will never accomplish our boldest, most progressive policy ideas if we don't get big money out of politics first. My Clean Elections Plan is a way to get there. Read more about it here: 
Plans like mine will put our elections back in the hands of the people instead of special interests‚Äîand in a functioning democracy, shouldn't that be the standard? 
Not only do clean elections make candidates less beholden to big money, but they amplify more voices in the process. Historically political donors have been disproportionately white, male, older and very wealthy. Democracy Dollars will bring more people to the table. 
How can we know if my Clean Elections Plan will work? The answer is, it already has. My plan is modeled in part off of a program in Seattle, which has led to candidates relying less on big money, making them more accountable to their constituents. 
In commemoration of  we honor the millions of lives taken in the Holocaust‚Äîand we must recommit to fighting the rising threats of anti-Semitism, bigotry and white supremacy around the globe and here at home. Our silence is not an option.

Attorney General Barr needs to resign. Today, he's proven once again that he's more interested in protecting the president than working for the American people. We can't trust him to tell the truth, and these embarrassing displays of propaganda have to stop.
Show me a supposedly ‚Äúunfixable‚Äù problem in Washington, and I‚Äôll show you the political corruption standing in the way. That‚Äôs why I rolled out my Clean Elections plan‚Äîbold reform to attack the corrupting influence of money at its core. 
Big money in politics has bred a culture where special interests and wealthy megadonors‚Äîwho are overwhelmingly white, male and older‚Äîhave all the influence in our elections. My Clean Elections plan amplifies voices that haven‚Äôt been heard for too long.  
We can change the way Washington works by leveling the playing field of whose voices are heard in our democracy. It starts with getting big money out of our elections, and I have a plan to do just that. 
Big money has corrupted our politics, allowing wealthy donors' voices to drown out everyone else's. If we want a government that works for all of us, we have to ensure that elected officials in Washington actually represent the people who sent them there. 
If we want to fix what's broken in Washington, we have to start at the root of the problem: money in politics. Today, I'm announcing a bold new Clean Elections plan to combat political corruption and bring more people to the table in our government. 
Again and again and again. We can't accept this as our reality. For  for Parkland, for Santa Fe, and for too many communities who've lived through a day at school turning into a nightmare‚Äîwe have to fix this. 
The photos coming out of Davenport are heartbreaking. I'm thinking of all the families, first responders and all those impacted along the Mississippi River and across the Heartland who have faced historic flooding this year. Please stay safe and follow officials' instructions. 
New Hampshire takes their responsibility seriously as the  primary. I always love talking with voters there‚Äîand future voters like Scout!‚Äîbecause they‚Äôre not afraid to get to the heart of the issues that matter most to working families. Good news: neither am I. 
Women make up a majority of Democratic voters, but they have almost never had an equal or majority stake in powering presidential campaigns. We're changing that. 
We need 65,000 individual donors to secure a spot on the debate stage. If you chip in $1, you can help get us there.  
When I meet girls like Scout on the trail, I always take time to tell them they can be leaders too. It turns out Scout runs a lemonade stand to help children at the border. She didn't wait for someone to tell her she could lead‚Äîshe just did it!

Our democracy is strongest when voters have the freedom to head to the ballot box to make their voice heard. The efforts of to restrict this right for tens of thousands of students is unconscionable. I strongly support efforts to amend and repeal this bill.

As a Senator who represents 9/11 victims, I can't accept any minimizing of that pain. But Trump's dangerous rhetoric against is disgusting. It‚Äôs a false choice to suggest we can‚Äôt fight terrorism and reject Islamophobic hate at once‚Äîa president should do both.

Our troops deserve a Commander in Chief who fights for them as fiercely as they fight for this country. President Trump's transgender military ban, taking effect today, proves he fails that standard. As president I will end this. 
The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is a bureaucratic nightmare that has shortchanged millions of teachers, social workers, nurses and other public servants of the loan forgiveness they've earned and I just introduced a bill to fix it.

The reason I've fought for so many years to end sexual assault in our military, on our college campuses, and in Congress comes down to one question: Do we value women? Unfortunately, there's a lot of evidence that we don't. I believe women and survivors deserve better. 
I talked with CNN after our town hall about issues like climate change and health care, bringing people together, and why I love Wonder Woman. 
Last night, a student named Alexis asked why I held my campaign kickoff rally outside of Trump International. Here's why. 
A six-week abortion ban without exceptions for rape or incest. Unconstitutional and unconscionable. Ohio women are being endangered with this bill. Gov. DeWine: Veto this. 
Medicare For All is an ambitious goal. But we also need a plan for how to get there, and I have one: Under my transition plan, we'd create a public option and force insurance companies to compete. That's how we can lower costs and get to universal health care.

Everyone knows the truth on this: Health care in this country is just too expensive.Today I joined my Senate colleagues in co-sponsoring a new Medicare For All bill. We need everyone who supports it to speak out‚Äîsign our petition to join our fight: 
Health care should be a fundamental right, and the American people deserve leaders who won't rest until we meet that goal. I'm proud to co-sponsor Medicare For All as we re-introduce it in the Senate today.
 ‚ÄúThe problem with our health care system is greed and corruption, starting right here in Washington.‚Äù - 
Bringing people together isn't just how we'll beat Trump in 2020‚Äîit's what this country needs from our next president. I'll do it because it's what I've always done. 
Ending gun violence in this country is an issue of changing hearts and speaking to people's humanity. We can't give up that fight. Our kids' lives have to come before gun lobby greed. 
Americans deserve a president who leads with bravery and compassion‚Äînot cowardice and hate. If you're ready to take on this fight with us, chip in $5 to help power this campaign:  
We should confront the existential threat of climate change like JFK's moonshot: Let's pass a  and get to net-zero carbon emissions not because it's easy, but because it's hard. The whole point is that it's an ambitious set of goals‚Äîwhy not try? 
When kids are being killed in their schools and in their communities in an epidemic of gun violence, every public official's humanity should kick in. NRA money is in the way. This can't wait‚Äîwe have to put lives over greed. 
If you've served your sentence and are reentering society, you should have the right to participate in our democracy and have a say in who represents you. We should restore returning citizens' right to vote. 
We need Medicare For All, and I wrote a plan to get there by creating a public option that you can buy into. That's how we can create competition with insurance companies, get costs down, and make sure everyone has access to the health care they need. 
President Trump is weak. He is a coward. Americans deserve a president who's brave. It's time to put a leader back in the White House. 
If you're unwilling to stand up to the special interests that control everything in Washington, you're never going to make the changes we need. We need a president who's brave enough to stand up to the powerful and fight for what's right. 
We have to end sexual assault and harassment in this country because it comes down to one important question: Do we value women? There's only one acceptable answer. 
I'm the right candidate to take on President Trump because I can bring people together. I have and I can win red, purple, and blue districts. We need a president who will fix what's broken in this country‚Äîthat's why I'm running. 
What President Trump is doing to immigrant families at the border is inhumane and has nothing to do with national security. We need a complete transformation of our immigration policy and a real pathway to citizenship.

Tonight I'll take the stage for our first town hall! It's an exciting chance to answer voters' questions and share why I'm running and who I'm fighting for. Tune in at 10 pm ET!  
Getting ready for tonight‚Äôs CNN town hall! 
Millions of Americans feel left behind right now because they see Washington as only working for the powerful. And they're absolutely right. 
The Electoral College is undermining the most basic principle of a direct democracy: one person, one vote. I think it's time to end its control over our presidential elections‚Äîsign our petition if you agree: 
Protecting kids from harm and discrimination shouldn't require brave leadership‚Äîit should just be what we do. Thank you, and the advocates who've been leading this moral fight. 
 is so right: If someone is brave enough to serve their country, they deserve our respect. Patriotism doesn't have a gender. 
When it comes to this election, there‚Äôs one question we need to ask ourselves: 
Years from now, we will all be asked, "What did you do when hate reigned? What battle did you take on? Who were you willing to stand up to?" If we want to be proud of our answer to that question, we have to fight now. 
I voted against Kirstjen Nielsen‚Äôs nomination, and called for her resignation over the administration‚Äôs inhumane treatment of immigrant families six months ago. What this country truly needs is a moral reset on immigration policies‚Äîwe won‚Äôt get that in this administration.
We celebrated 18 years today at our favorite brunch place, rode some scooters, and played ping pong with friends. Happy anniversary, Jonathan. Love you. 
While we were still reeling from the attacks on 9/11, these brave emergency responders rushed to serve our country. Now these patriots are dying from the toxic exposure they endured at Ground Zero.Not renewing the Victim Compensation Fund‚Äîpermanently‚Äîwould be a moral failure. 
Any system that is built on disenfranchising voters is a system that needs to be torn down. We can't call this a true democracy as long as the Electoral College determines our elections‚Äîif you agree, sign our petition to end it: 
I think public service is about listening‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I‚Äôve done more than 60 public events (and counting!) since announcing my run for president. Tune in to our town hall with voters in Concord, NH: 
Thank you for having me! It‚Äôs time to make national paid family leave the priority it deserves to be. 
If we want to break down the systematic barriers holding back too many unemployed and underemployed Americans‚Äîparticularly in low-income communities‚Äîwe have to make accessible the job training people need to work their way into the middle class. 
Racist language like this has led to violence throughout the world‚Äôs history. No human being is an animal. We have to be better than this.
Loved meeting voters (and future voters) in Dover, NH! 
My national public service plan would make college accessible while advancing our goals in infrastructure, green energy and job training. 
 Thank you Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for joining us this afternoon at the 2019 National Action Network Convention. 
I think the American people want a president who is brave, who will lead with compassion rather than hate, and who will repair our moral fabric. That's why I'm running.

Survivors of campus sexual assault have shown extraordinary bravery by sharing their stories, demanding change, and leading a national movement to end this scourge at our colleges and universities. We should honor their bravery with action. 
We should value women more than NRA greed, period. Let's pass the Violence Against Women Act in the Senate now. 
51 years ago today, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. We can't forget his legacy of fiercely tackling injustice, nor the hate that cut his life short. His goals of equality and resistance to bigotry are as timely as ever‚Äîlet's honor him by continuing to fight for them.
For far too long, colleges and universities have gotten away with turning a blind eye to the epidemic of campus sexual assault. We owe it to survivors to change the system and hold institutions accountable for protecting students. 
One of my favorite days of the year: the first Congressional Women‚Äôs Softball team practice of the season. Press team doesn‚Äôt stand a chance! 
Ten years ago today, Iowa legalized marriage equality: one of the first steps toward making it the law of the land in America. Our work isn't done until every LGBTQ person is safe and free from discrimination‚Äîbut we're not done fighting. Cheers to victories, past and future. 
When it comes to historic milestones for representation, progress, and equality, sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Congratulations to Chicago‚Äôs new mayor, Photo: Kamil Krzaczy≈Ñski 
If we want to restore power to the people, we have to get to the root of our central problem: corruption and greed. 
If the Georgia GOP actually cared about family values and saving lives, they'd be addressing maternal mortality instead of decimating access to safe reproductive health care.  
President Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country. He demonizes the vulnerable and punches down. He puts his name in bold on every building. He does this because he wants us to believe he's strong. He's not. Our President is a coward.Americans deserve better‚Ää. 
President Trump has twisted the issue of immigration because he's a coward, and he's afraid of refugees. Let's untwist it: We need to secure our border, but we also need real immigration reform, a path to citizenship, and to treat asylum seekers with humanity instead of hate. 
Leadership requires bravery. And if we don't have the courage to take on the most urgent threat we face, then what are we doing? 
If you're elected president, you have to represent everyone. It makes no sense for the outcome of our elections to not actually reflect the number of votes received. 
It's absurd that the leader of our country is chosen by a distorted system instead of the voices of all Americans. Proud to support bill to abolish the Electoral College. 
 What's at stake today? A fair and impartial judiciary. extreme partisan agenda has no place in our highe‚Ä¶

If women made up 51% of our elected offices, do you think we'd still be fighting for equal pay, affordable daycare, and paid leave? I think it's time to change who's at the decision-making table, and start prioritizing issues that have taken a back seat for too long.  
President Trump is a bully and a coward, and his callousness towards Puerto Ricans who are still suffering is outrageous. He needs to stop lying and start helping our fellow citizens on the island‚Äîand I won't vote for a bill that cuts out the aid and rebuilding money they need.

The fact that we have a gender pay gap in 2019 means we're still struggling to value women in this country‚Äîand women of color even more. We need to make basic structural changes to ensure women can make what they earn.  
Women on average may make 20% less than white men‚Äîand many women of color much less‚Äîbut your glass will be 100% full with our new  mug. Get yours and support our campaign to fight for equal pay for equal work:  
When presidents are elected without the majority of Americans' votes, something is seriously broken in our democracy. Let's fix it. 
Our democracy is built on the principle of one person, one vote. It can't function until we restore that principle. It's time to abolish the Electoral College.

It's mutual, you're welcome for dinner any time. Great job last night! 
Making national paid leave a reality for every worker in America has been my priority as a Senator, it's a priority in my campaign, and it would be a priority in my administration‚Äîexactly how it should be. 
I will go toe-to-toe with anyone to do the right thing. Whether it‚Äôs powerful institutions, the President, or even my own party. 
We can't fix what's broken in Washington unless we're brave enough to fundamentally change the way our government works, and detox our politics from the influence of unaccountable money. Join me in asking every 2020 candidate to release their tax returns:  
 ‚ÄòLook up at [Trump] Tower. A shrine to greed, division, and vanity.‚Äô ‚Äî literally brought her 2020 campaign‚Ä¶
50 women are shot to death by their partners every month in America. We have to face the fact that there is a deadly connection between violence against women and guns in America. Leaders who put NRA blood money over women's lives shouldn't be anywhere near our laws. 
I was the first member of Congress to make my official meetings, personal financial disclosures and taxes public. Now I'm the first presidential candidate to release my tax returns for 2018‚Äîand every year since 2007. Ask every candidate to do the same: 
Corruption and greed are the root of almost all evil in our democracy. We need to protect voting rights and the integrity of our elections, get dark money out of politics and make government answerable to people again. Give the  Act a vote.
Democrats should proudly be the party of honesty, transparency and accountability. It's what voters deserve, and it's who we are. Add your name to join me in calling on every 2020 candidate to release their tax returns: 
Kudos to my friend and fellow New Yorker for refusing to accept corporate PAC donations. Voters need to know we're working for them, not special interests‚Äîand we can't fix Washington until we walk the walk on transparency. 
Transparency is essential to combating the corrupting influence of money in politics. The American people should know that their president is beholden to no one but them‚Äîthat's why I‚Äôm urging all presidential candidates to join me and disclose at least ten years of their taxes. 
My tax returns for every year I‚Äôve been in office, including 2018, are now public.We can't win our fight against Donald Trump without transparency and accountability. Sign my petition calling on every 2020 candidate to release their tax returns, too: 
I just published my latest tax returns, like I do every year.I've now released 12 years of my tax returns because voters deserve to know we're beholden only to them. If you agree, sign our petition calling on all presidential candidates to do the same:  
Criminalizing women for exercising their constitutional rights is as dystopian as it gets. Doing so while ignoring the highest maternal mortality rate in the country is just hypocrisy. This bill is an outrage, and we all need to speak out against it. 
We are living under an administration with no humanity. 
Saving our planet should not be a partisan issue. Putting our kids' and grandkids' futures over today's fossil fuel profits should not be a hard choice to make. We need to treat global climate change like the urgent, existential threat that it is, and act accordingly. 
Cutting people around the world off from reproductive health care hurts whole communities, degrades public health and results in more deaths. This policy is abominable, and I'll overturn it on day one of my presidency.

Couldn't agree more. 
The people of this country deserve a president worthy of your bravery. That's why I‚Äôm running for President of the United States. 
If it‚Äôs a fight for healthcare this administration wants, it‚Äôs a fight they‚Äôll get‚Äîand we will win. 
Find me a so-called unsolvable problem, and I will point you to the dark, unaccountable money in its way‚Äîwhether it's opioid makers getting a pass instead of indictments, or the NRA stopping gun reform. We need to crack open our government and let the light flood in.
What don‚Äôt you want the American people to see, 
Americans across party lines agree that we need paid leave for every worker. New Hampshire voters chose leaders who campaigned on it, including He is wrong to renege on that promise. Granite Staters deserve paid leave. 
Two survivors of the Parkland shooting and one parent of a child killed at Sandy Hook have died by suicide in the past week. Tragic doesn't begin to cover it.The trauma of this violence doesn't end when the news cycle moves on. We have to fix this. 
Yesterday, we joined together in New York City to reject hate and fear, and to show that when we speak out, lock arms and fight for our values, brave wins.Read my full speech from our official campaign kickoff rally:  
What a day. 
President Trump is a coward. That's not what America deserves. We deserve a president who is brave. 
The Mueller report must be made public. Not just a letter from someone appointed by Trump to protect himself‚Äîall of it. The President works for the people, and he is not above the law. 
Thank you, New York! 
This fight is so much bigger than any one election‚Äîit‚Äôs about making a choice and deciding who we are. So will we defend this democracy? Will we reject hate and fear? Will we be brave?If you‚Äôre with me, chip in and let's win this fight:  
Years from now, we will look back on this moment in our history, and we‚Äôll be able to say that we did something about it.We stood up, locked arms and proved to America‚Äîand the world‚Äîthat when people come together to drive out darkness, hope rises.Fear loses.And 
None of these big fights will be easy. But I‚Äôve never backed down from a fight for what‚Äôs right, and I‚Äôm not about to start now.That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in this race. I'm running for president to fix what‚Äôs been broken, repair our moral fabric and rebuild our common bonds.
We need to treat climate change like the existential threat it is and pass a  Let‚Äôs make it our generation‚Äôs moonshot. Addressing a global challenge of this urgency will take massive effort and transformative vision‚Äîwhich is exactly why we should do it.
We must hold accountable any threats to our democracy.The Mueller report must be made public. Nobody is above the law. I don‚Äôt often agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say the American people have a right to know whether or not their president is a crook.
We need to restore our moral leadership in the world. We must secure our borders effectively and fight terrorism relentlessly, but let‚Äôs be very clear: Racism and fear are not a national security strategy.
We need to dismantle institutional racism. We need solutions both targeted and broad‚Äîlike higher standards for maternity care, a national commitment to full employment, postal banking, ending cash bail and legalizing marijuana.
Hear me when I say this: Paid leave, equal pay and affordable daycare are not just ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issues.‚Äù These are economic issues‚Äîones that will determine whether or not our country succeeds. 
Our goals are ambitious, but they shouldn't be controversial:Medicare for all.Universal pre-K and high-quality public education.Affordable college.Full employment.A $15 minimum wage.National paid leave.
As president, I will fight for publicly-funded federal elections. It would change the way Washington works overnight. Imagine your voice being just as loud as the Koch brothers‚Äîwhat a concept!We have to level the political playing field so our democracy can thrive.
Right now, special interests are displacing the voices of the people in our democracy. Find me a so-called unsolvable problem, and I'll point you to the greed and corruption in the way.We need to crack open our government, flip the switch and let the light flood in.
I‚Äôm fighting for an America where where compassion and integrity define our government, not self-interest and corruption. Where we don‚Äôt just care about the profits we make today, but the future we‚Äôre leaving to our grandchildren.I know we can be that America.
I stood up to greed and voted against the bank bailout.I stood up to corruption in Congress.I stood up to the Pentagon, Congress and colleges on behalf of survivors of sexual assault. And I‚Äôm proud to have stood up to Trump more than anyone else in the Senate.
My grandmother Polly taught me that being brave doesn‚Äôt just mean standing up for yourself‚Äîit means standing up for other people who need you. Bravery means standing up to the powerful, and summoning the courage to confront them head on. And that's what I've done.
Day in and day out, Americans are making a choice to resist the backward pull of this administration, and pushing us toward a better future.The people of this country deserve a president worthy of your bravery. That's why I‚Äôm running for president.
We deserve a president who is brave. A president who inspires us to stand for something greater than ourselves.We don‚Äôt build walls; we build bridges. Because our unity of purpose lifts us higher than any tower.
President Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country. He demonizes the vulnerable and he punches down. He puts his name in bold on every building.He does all of this because he wants us to believe he is strong. He is not. Our President is a coward.
Brave isn‚Äôt winning right now.Brave doesn‚Äôt spread hate or bully the vulnerable. Brave doesn‚Äôt put greed and self-interest over millions of lives. Brave doesn‚Äôt cower behind lies and walls. Brave doesn‚Äôt pit people against one another. That‚Äôs what fear does.
‚ÄúKirsten‚Äôs dedication isn‚Äôt just to my son, it‚Äôs to your sons and daughters, to you, and to all of us. She cannot be knocked down. And she listens. That is what we need to lead us out of the storm.‚Äù  actor and activist

‚ÄúWe are all brave enough to fight. I am proud to be here to tell you that there is no other candidate that is more prepared to invest and empower all of the American people than your NY Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand.‚Äù ‚ÄîAndrea Pino-Silva, anti-sexual assault activist 
‚ÄúWe owe it to our world, to our country, to our children, to the people who fought for this‚Äîto ensure that our fight never ends. To ensure that the bravery of New Yorkers helps lead the country once again.‚Äù ‚ÄîGabriel Blau, LGBTQ rights activist 
‚ÄúI want to see someone elected as president who is unafraid to stand up and bring us closer to LGBT equity and equality.‚Äù ‚ÄîTanya Asapansa-Johnson Walker, transgender rights activist 
‚ÄúBefore Senator Gillibrand, we did not have any hope. Now we have hope. We are feeling brave. We know there‚Äôs somebody standing with us and being a voice for the voiceless.‚Äù ‚ÄîJackie Rowe-Adams, gun safety advocate 
‚ÄúBravery isn‚Äôt always loud. Sometimes bravery is quiet and isn‚Äôt in the headlines. Sometimes bravery listens.‚Äù ‚ÄîAnnie Clark, anti-sexual assault activist

Setting the stage for a campaign rally that‚Äôs all about fighting for what‚Äôs right, no matter who we‚Äôre up against.

On November 3, 2020, we will send a resounding rebuke to Donald Trump and vote him out of office. And tomorrow, we'll put him on notice by standing up for our values and sharing our vision, right in his front yard. Join us in NYC at noon ET:

When I studied abroad in China, was right beside me. In our decades of friendship, she's continued to inspire me as an activist to combat poverty and advance equal rights for women on top of her career as an actor. I'm so glad she'll be with us tomorrow.  
Monica Sibri believes that representation matters, and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs fighting to elect young women and standing up for Dreamers like herself. Monica's being brave and showing her communities how to be brave too.  
When Annie Clark saw firsthand that colleges weren‚Äôt doing enough to protect students from sexual assault, she filed a Title IX complaint to hold her school accountable‚Äîand won. Her bravery helped kickstart a national movement to end sexual assault on campuses.  
Tanya Asapansa-Johnson Walker has embodied bravery in more ways than one‚Äîfrom serving in the US Army to serving marginalized transgender people to fighting for the rights of women, LGBTQ people and the undocumented. I'm honored to have her with me tomorrow.  
It takes extraordinary bravery for a sexual assault survivor to tell their story. Andrea Pino-Silva did, and then she kept going. She helped lead a nationwide charge to combat sexual assault on college campuses by changing policies and empowering survivors.  
Gabriel Blau has spent his career fighting so that all families are treated with respect and equality. Being brave means standing up for others in addition to yourself‚ÄîGabriel acts on those values.  
Lisdy Contreras-Giron is a Dreamer in every sense of the word. She came to the US at 5, and now she's getting her law degree to help marginalized people. She uses her voice to advocate for equal opportunity for everyone, no matter where you came from. That‚Äôs bravery.  
When Jackie Rowe-Adams lost two of her sons to gun violence, she turned her unimaginable pain into action. She formed a group of moms and other safety advocates dedicated to ending gun violence in Harlem. Jackie chose to be brave, and New York is better for it.  
Exciting news: I'm honored that I'll be joined by some inspiring people on stage at our campaign kickoff rally tomorrow in New York City. Today we'll introduce those people, and their stories of everyday bravery.RSVP to the rally here:  
If we're going to make our economy work for families, we have to transform the infrastructure of work to make it easier to be a parent AND make a living. We need equal pay for equal work, affordable daycare for all and national paid leave. It's 2019. Let's get this done. 
Whatever Mueller's report contains, here's what we already know: Trump has spread hate, clouded truth, sown division and undermined our democracy. On Sunday, we'll send him a message that says: Your time is up. Join us at noon at Trump International: 
Full details of the Trump campaign‚Äôs coordination with Russia, under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, need to be made public. Sign the petition now to stop the Trump administration from burying the truth!

America's students and graduates are already being crushed by student debt. They deserve a president who'll help lift that burden‚Äîinstead, Trump's proposed budget makes it way worse. Cutting student loan programs by $200 billion to help pay for millionaires' tax cuts is shameful.
I've done a lot of interviews in my career, but taking and to my favorite dive bar in Troy, NY has to be the best one.

I had the best time showing and around Troy, NY and definitely beating them at bowling. Watch on  tonight! 
Thanks to so many Iowans who helped us kick off the first week of our official presidential campaign! Be back soon. 
We need to pass universal background checks, ban assault rifles, and stop gun trafficking. We need to close gun sale loopholes to make sure guns can‚Äôt get into the hands of dangerous criminals, terrorists, or domestic abusers. And we can't let the NRA's greed stop us. 
Thank you, and Pastor Whitfield, for a powerful conversation about healthcare, criminal justice reform, and expanding opportunity for communities of color in Iowa. Looking forward to spending a Sunday with you both soon! (And thank you for introducing us, 
Let's put aside the overreaching, fake national emergency for a minute. How does Trump intend to pay for his pointless wall and tax cuts for millionaires? By cutting $845 billion from Medicare, $26B from Social Security, and $200B from student loan programs. It's all wrong.
The best way to provide national paid leave is to make it an earned benefit, just like Social Security. Under my plan, you and your employer would each pay in $2/week, and you'd get 12 weeks of paid leave. It's that simple. 
We can defeat Trump and his hate-fueled agenda, but only if we do it together. So this Sunday, 3/24, let's take our collective voice to Trump International Hotel in NYC and stand against the division, fear and corruption Trump has sown. RSVP to rally now:

Good to be back in Iowa. Do you like my new workout shirt? 
One of the many problems with Trump is Betsy DeVos. She's unqualified and unfit for the job, and that's why I voted against her nomination.The Department of Education needs to protect students, not predatory lenders and sexual abusers. Enforcing Title IX shouldn't be optional. 
Congratulations to Iowa‚Äôs newest State Senator, Elections matter‚Äîcan't want to see the great things he'll do in the Iowa Senate, and bravo to the dedicated volunteers and supporters who won this fight for our progressive values. 
I'm hard-pressed to think of any policy more cruel‚Äîand more hypocritical for a party that claims to have family values‚Äîthan cutting lifelines for low-income children. We are not going to let kids go hungry so Trump can pay for his tax cuts for billionaires.

Tens of thousands of Americans are killed with guns every year. Many are kids. There's no excuse for the NRA's chokehold on our laws; even gun owners want background checks. Someone has to protect the children of this country against the danger your greed puts them in. I will. 
What's happening at our border is inhumane and intolerable, and it doesn't make us safer. These are refugees and asylum seekers. We need to secure our border in smart ways, end family separation and create a real path to citizenship.There is no such thing as an illegal human.

White supremacy and hate crimes are on the rise around the world. Donald Trump didn't create them, but he has poured gasoline on that fire, and his hate has made us all less safe. I refuse to let it go unchecked. I will stand up to him and I will fight for the best of our values. 
I knew that calling on Al Franken to resign was a risk, but silence wasn‚Äôt an option. I‚Äôm running for president to fight for a country that values women, and I‚Äôm ready to share this vision with the American people. Will you give $1 to help us bring our vision to the debate stage?

Tonight, I talked to Michiganders about why I'm the best candidate to take on President Trump and fight for our values. If you liked what you heard, chip in $3 to help make sure I can share that vision at the Democratic primary debates:  
Donald Trump's hatred makes us less safe. His Muslim ban makes us less safe. So I will protect this country. I will make sure that we are safe, but I will make sure that we remember that we are at our best when we love one another. 
Donald Trump did not create hate and racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism. But what he has done is poured fuel on the fire that is raging more than I've seen in my lifetime. I will stand up against him and his hate.  
I know the issue of Sen. Franken is hard for many Democrats. But he had eight credible sexual harassment allegations against him, and I had to choose whether to stay silent, or not. If some megadonors have a problem with that, that's on them. 
Clean air and clean water is a human right. I‚Äôve made clean water one of my priorities, including the PIPES Act. We should make polluters pay for the damage they inflict on communities, and stop rolling back EPA regulations. 
There is no such thing as an illegal human.In our best moments, we have not been afraid of immigrants; in our worst moments, we have. We have to fundamentally transform how we treat people seeking asylum and refugees. 
Health care should be a right, not a privilege. We need a president who'll fight for universal, quality coverage that's affordable for everybody. I believe we need  and that we should create a public option as a transition to single-payer. 
Student debt is an out-of-control crisis in this country, and it isn‚Äôt just a burden on individual graduates‚Äîit‚Äôs a drag on the whole economy.  
America is the only industrialized country in the world without a national paid leave plan. It's 2019. Let's make this a priority at last.  
Rewarding work means a few things to me:We need to support unions and workers' rights.We need to raise the minimum wage to $15.We need to invest in job training.We need national paid leave. And we need to punish companies who outsource American jobs. 
America is facing an opioid crisis, and one of the ways we need to put a stop to it is by holding opioid makers accountable for their greed. They knowingly put their profits over people's lives, and they should be prosecuted. 
We need to get money out of politics because the way Washington works is that the powerful have unlimited power, and money is the name of the game. If we want change, we need to stand up to the powerful special interests and restore the people's voices. 
We all have a responsibility to end gun violence in this country. We all have to take on the corruption and greed that the NRA represents. It is unacceptable, and I will hold them accountable.  
I‚Äôm the best candidate to take on Trump because I have the vision of what needs to be done in America. I‚Äôve listened to voters about their lives, and I have the compassion to absorb that and offer a real plan. I have the experience and I‚Äôve gotten things done.
