If I‚Äôd been on the debate, I‚Äôd have brought up 2 extremely important issues which ; other candidates failed to address.  Coronavirus: a huge health ; economic threat to our country/world.  Critical time-sensitive foreign policy crises on the verge of erupting.

Tulsi Gabbard LIVE - Virtual Roundtable with Dave Navarro    
 AAPI voters have consistently proven to be the swing vote in many key states, and yet are too often ignored, forgotten, or taken for granted as a monolithic voting demographic. Not true. AAPI are diverse ; have unique experiences that inform the issues we are concerned about.
 Thanks for hosting!
 To name a few - we must address increasing tuition costs, protect students from predatory lenders, allow student debt to qualify for bankruptcy, expand access to community college/vocational training/apprenticeships ; maximize technology to reduce cost of education. 
 I will work with Congress to pass sensible gun safety legislation like closing the Charleston loophole ; universal mandatory background checks, and upholding the 2nd Amendment. We can do this when we stand together, as Americans, to ensure the safety of all Americans. 
 AAPI families continue to struggle with family separation ; other challenges due to heavy backlogs in our broken legal immigration system. We need comprehensive immigration reform and a humane system that actually works to support families, our economy ; our country. 
 Government services must be available to all Americans, including those who may have a language barrier. As we do in my multicultural home state of Hawaii, accurate demographic data allows us to provide multi-lingual translations to serve the needs of our communities. 
 We need to improve the data collected through the census to ensure it more accurately captures our population, and to better understand the challenges and needs of our people so we can enact reforms to ensure a bright future for ALL Americans. 
 Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Hawaiians have very different needs and concerns within their own communities. We need to change and improve the way that data is collected to represent their unique challenges.
 As an Asian/Polynesian/Caucasian woman, I bring the voices of NHPI leaders to the Presidency to ensure we stand together to address the inequities that still exist. Indigenous voices in this country will be heard ; will have a seat at the table in my Administration. 
 I will continue my work in Congress where NHPI issues have been a major focus throughout my 7 years there, passing legislation like the Native Hawaiian Education Reauthorization Act ; others to address housing needs, support for Native Hawaiian owned businesses, and more. (1/2)
 I represent the most diverse district in Congress, made up of an AAPI majority population. As the only AAPI candidate running for President, I will continue to lift their voices ; unique concerns impacting AAPI ; ensure they are represented in my Administration.

I visited Auschwitz in 2005, walked through the gas chambers, saw piles of eye glasses ; shoes of those slaughtered there. Their memory must live on. As anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise, we must stand against hate ; bigotry.

No War With Iran. Get our troops out of Iraq and Syria now.    
You have my personal commitment that as president I will not be bullied by the foreign policy establishment that has been perpetuating regime change wars, a new cold war ; arms race. Instead of investing trillions on such wars, we must invest in the needs of the American people. 
We need to get out of Iraq and Syria now. That is the only way that we're going to prevent ourselves from being dragged into this quagmire, deeper and deeper into a war with Iran.

 Our condolences and aloha to you and your family, Andrew. üôèüèΩ
We spend $4 billion every month on a war in Afghanistan. How can we look our veterans in the eye ; tell them we have no money for their healthcare? As president, I‚Äôll work to end these wars, bring our troops home, ; treat our veterans with the respect they deserve.  
For a number of reasons, I have decided not to attend the December 19th "debate" ‚Äî regardless of whether or not there are qualifying polls. I instead choose to spend that precious time directly meeting with and hearing from the people of New Hampshire and South Carolina.

Tulsi Gabbard LIVE - Portsmouth Rotary Club Guest Speaker - Greenland, NH    
I don‚Äôt fit into any box. I have a simple common sense message: let's do what's best of the American people, our country and planet without caring who gets the credit.  
Rather than debate the wisdom of US military intervention in foreign countries, those who profit from these wars smear me with ‚Äúforeign agent‚Äù lies. I will usher in a new foreign policy that is in our country‚Äôs best interests and allows us to be force for good in the world. 
Sending my best wishes to her family ; supporters who have campaigned so hard. While we disagree on some issues, we agree on others ; I respect her sincere desire to serve the American people. I look forward to working together on the challenges we face as a nation

Chris Matthews: ‚ÄúWhy are so many Democrat leaders war hawks?‚Äù Intelligent but all too rare question from MSM. So important to our country/world. Only had a minute to reply. Listen for yourself.  
Voting rights are essential for our democracy. Securing our elections is essential for our democracy. I have introduced legislation called the Securing America‚Äôs Elections Act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voter‚Äôs voice is heard.  
The only way to prevent war is being ready to meet with adversaries and potential adversaries. Diplomacy is the only alternative to war. I take the example of leaders who come before us‚Äîlike JFK who met with Khrushchev, Roosevelt who met with Stalin, Reagan who met with Gorbachev 
What happened in Bolivia is a coup. Period. The United States and other countries should not be interfering in the Bolivian people's pursuit of self-determination and right to choose their own government.

Congratulations Gov. on your re-election! Our country needs more leaders willing to put people first and work in a spirit of bipartisanship to make a difference in the lives of all Americans.

You‚Äôre talking about one bill vs. another bill. Really what we should be talking about is our objective: making sure every single American is able to get the healthcare that they need. I believe Medicare for all is the way to do that.   
Our leaders have failed us, taking us into one regime change war after the next, leading us into a new Cold War ; arms race, costing us trillions of our hard earned tax payer dollars ; countless lives. This insanity must end.

To those in America and around the world observing Ramadan, I extend all best wishes, respect, and love.  
The main responsibility of the president is to keep Americans safe. Trump has failed‚Äîundermining our national security by tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, threatening military action, bringing us closer to war with Iran that will be far worse than war in Iraq.
It is critical that we understand the importance of engaging with other nuclear powers with respect and in a spirit of cooperation rather than conflict. As president I will work to end the cold war and decrease tensions that are bringing us closer to nuclear catastrophe. 
I will put service above self, bringing the spirit of servant leadership back to Washington, to ensure our government is truly of, by and for the people. Join me in taking a stand against the powerful forces of greed and corruption.

We as a country must stand up and condemn hatred, bigotry ; violence, whether it be based on your religion, color of your skin, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or where you come from. We need leaders who‚Äôll stand up against bigotry. And that leadership needs to start at the top.

The new Cold War is getting hotter. We need leaders with foresight to see how in Venezuela, Syria ; other places, potential military conflict btwn US-Russia can quickly escalate into war‚Äînuclear war, the greatest danger we face today. 
Our leaders, beginning with Pres. Trump, should be serving the interests of the American people, not foreign governments‚Äîlike the theocratic dictatorship of Saudi Arabia. Such self-serving powerful politicians are selling out America‚Äôs interests for Saudi blood money. Shameless.

Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal increases the likelihood of war ; undermines talks with Kim Jong Un to denuclearize N. Korea. While the Iran deal is not perfect, it is working by preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and preventing an all-out war.

 The most dangerous coverup is that US voting machines are vulnerable to hackers. If we lose faith in election results, democracy crumbles. The Justice Dept should be focused on instituting paper ballot backups, per my Securing America's Elections Act.

Insulin is overpriced and it‚Äôs killing Americans. Between 1997 and 2017, Big Pharma increased the price of insulin over 1,000%. People are dying because they can‚Äôt afford insulin.

Trump‚Äôs effort to rollback regulations means that Big Ag now gets to inspect its own pork - ; they decided to stop testing for E. coli. This endangers everyone, even if you don‚Äôt eat pork, because bacteria can easily spread on shared surfaces. This is swamp politics at its worst.

President Trump's grounding of the 737 MAX 8/9 planes was the right thing to do. This is an example of what the president's emergency powers are meant for -- "emergency" is not meant to replace Congress‚Äô constitutional power of the purse strings to fund his border wall.
(2/2) Facebook proved the charge that they are undermining Free Speech. If Facebook will censor my speech, then they will censor yours as well. This is why we must stand up for free speech‚Äîwhether we agree with the content of that speech or not.

As President and Commander-in-Chief, I will end the wasteful counterproductive regime-change wars, and reinvest those trillions of dollars in the needs of the American people.

 Congrats I am one of them. Keep up the great work!
