Getting Dark Money out of politics is the fight of our time. I’ve made it the fight of my career. You bet I’ll make it the defining issue of my Presidency. 
Americans shouldn’t have to decide between life-saving drugs or a pile of debt. It’s time we treat healthcare as a right, not a privilege. 
Our public lands belong to us. 
It's time we have a leader who will work for all Americans no matter who you are or who you love. 
Whether at the ballot box or after the impeachment process, we must move forward, restore integrity to the Oval Office, and heal the divisions across our country. 
We don’t have time to wait. We must take immediate and durable steps to address climate change. 
We can’t ignore the warning signs. If we don’t win back the places we lost, then Trump will win. As the only candidate who’s actually won a Trump state, I can tell you we need to connect w/ these voters if we're ever going to win back the White House. 
We don’t accept a dime from PACs, because our campaign isn’t about them. It’s about you.

Over the last two weeks, Democrats have achieved major victories in deep red states by sticking to the playbook that won us 40 House seats in 2018 — show up everywhere and focus on serious solutions to the problems people face in their daily lives. 
While candidates bicker on stage about pie in the sky ideas, I will continue taking my case directly to voters on the ground. That’s how I’ve been elected 3 times in a state Trump won by 20. We can’t lose sight of political reality, otherwise we’ll never beat Trump. 
For the sake of our nation, this inquiry has to move forward swiftly and judiciously. 
Whether he’s removed by ballot box or impeachment, we have to bridge divides, stop the chaos, and get this country back on track. 
This race is going to be decided by you, the voters — not the Big Money donors and party bosses. 
After hearing from EU Ambassador Sondland this morning it's clear: the President and his cabinet tried to extort a foreign leader into investigating a political opponent. The House must move swiftly and judiciously.

This is what happens when we have an incompetent mobster in the Oval Office.

Trump. Pence. No matter who is on the ballot come November 2020, let’s make sure we keep them to one-term.
What we heard today makes it more clear that the President abused his office and jeopardized our national security for his own personal gain. Our democracy is at stake.
Look good for your perp walk:  
Good. Now do Rudy. 
We have to take immediate and durable action to combat climate change— and that starts with taking on the corrupting influence of money in our elections. 
If Trump pardons Roger Stone, it should be considered as another count in the impeachment proceedings. Abuse of power cannot provide shelter for lawlessness.
Take a break from impeachment to just remember that this administration gives tax breaks to millionaires and rips away food from hungry children. 
Now that the RNC is buying up rooms at a Trump resort, here's a throwback to the time the White House chief of staff went on national TV to promote Trump's business.

Three months ago, after a weekend of violence and tragedy, Trump promised he'd release a plan to reduce gun violence.He never did.He promised the same thing to me after Parkland.We need a President who will take action to guarantee our children’s safety.  
I’m heartbroken for the entire Santa Clarita community — and for our country.I’ll say it again: we cannot continue to confront gun violence with empty words.No one should fear for their safety when they're in a classroom, a concert, or a theater.Enough.

This is unacceptable. Healthcare access should not depend on the size of your paycheck. It should be a right for all. We can fix this with a strong public option, lowering drug prices, and building on the success of Obamacare, not dismantling it.
Dear Republican Members of Congress,Here’s the deal:Either you think it's OK that the President used the power of his office to extort a foreign leader into investigating a political opponent, or you don't.P.S. There is only one right answer here.

President Trump.In the Oval Office.With the extortion.
Whether Trump’s removed at the ballot box or by impeachment, our task is to bridge our divides, stop the chaos, and get our country back on track. 
Let's be clear: if the President used the power of his office to extort a foreign leader into investigating a political opponent, then the House needs to impeach him.
This hearing is about one thing: Congress upholding their responsibility to judiciously investigate these allegations.

This is not that hard. On Day 1 of my campaign, I made 14 years of my tax returns public.Trump is the first President in the modern era to not release his tax returns. Let’s make sure he’s the last.
After last week's elections it's clear that voters aren’t looking for campaigns driven by Twitter and more empty promises from Washington; they’re looking for leaders who have serious solutions to their everyday challenges. 
When you see the effects of climate change firsthand, you see that inaction is no longer an option. That’s why as Governor I led on expanding clean energy solutions, quadrupling our solar and doubling wind generation.
Here’s how it works: Trump tweets ➡️ Farmers lose money ➡️ America suffers. We need a real trade policy — not negotiations by tweet.
Here's my plan to make sure rural America thrives: 
Black farmers make significantly less than their white counterparts — with few to no resources to fight back. That’s wrong, and it’s exactly why I have a plan to invest in our rural communities and farmers of color. 
When we talk about issues that matter to Americans’ everyday lives, we win – and Donald Trump knows it. 
Tuesday’s election results are a wake-up call for Democrats. The path to winning back the places we've lost isn’t through more empty promises from Washington — it’s by focusing on solving problems in the here and now. That’s how we win again in 2020.
We are going to go everywhere, call everyone, and knock on every door we can find — and with friends like Jan Bauer on the team, I like our odds.

For him, it’s not America first. It’s Donald Trump first.
 Nick, I think you would look great with a bolo.  Want me to bring you one on my next visit?
The biggest problem with our immigration system is Donald Trump. 
Election Day should be a national holiday.
There are many requirements to be a good US Ambassador. Sucking up on Twitter isn’t one of them. 
VOTE.
National parks are not amusement parks, no matter what Donald Trump thinks. We save our national parks by investing in infrastructure and expanding access, not by unleashing Amazon drones and barring seniors at the gate. 
This is voter suppression, plain and simple. There is an easy solution: prevent states from needlessly purging voter rolls.  As President, I’ll do just that. 
We will not privatize our parks.
The White House should not be run by a failed businessman on Twitter. 
How Trump sees our public lands: 
Here are the countries that won't be in the Paris agreement: 🇺🇲Here are the countries that will be in the Paris agreement:🌍🌎🌏Trump is truly turning America First into America Alone.
Trump is putting polluters above people. This is the wrong move. When I'm President, we're rejoining the Paris agreement. Day 1. 
“Steve has the strength of character to put our nation back on track. I’m proud to endorse Steve Bullock for President, and I look forward to sharing his vision over the next four months as we head into the Caucus.” Staci Appel, Ackworth, Iowa.
I won with Trump on the ballot. I won with Romney on the ballot.I won with McCain on the ballot.I won without compromising our progressive values.I won by fighting like hell to deliver results.That's the way we win back the White House. Join us:  
Donald Trump's priorities:1. Helping his family profit off the Presidency.2. Tweeting.3. Golf. 
Donald Trump is willing to put homes, property, and the lives of Americans at risk for political retribution.
A budget is a statement of priorities — and if we want to make progress on the major challenges of our time, the first thing we need to do is restore faith ; participation in our democracy. As President, I’ll refuse to support any budget that doesn’t reform our democracy first.
Our economy is more than GDP and yield curves. It's over 300 million Americans making decisions every day around their kitchen tables.It’s time we make sure that everyone has the opportunity at a good paying job and a fulfilling career.
Let’s make it happen. Join us:  
November 2020: 
We’re going to go everywhere and speak with everyone.That’s how we’re going to win back the places we lost.One year from today, that’s how Democrats are going to win. 
All while the GOP is the only major political party in the world that won’t acknowledge climate change is human caused.
Even when we don’t agree on every detail, as Democrats we stand for our shared values and shared principles. That’s why in one year we’re gonna give Trump the boot!
I won three elections in a red state by showing up, listening, and making folks know that the government can work for us. That’s the type of leadership I’ll bring to the White House. 
It doesn’t matter if you wear boots or wingtips, whether you live in a big city or a small town, we know it takes more than your own bootstraps to make it in America. 
 I had the pleasure of meeting Governor Bullock last week. His impressive record of making divided government in MT work CAN…
This President is profiting off of the Presidency, and we’re paying the cost. In November 2020, we’re gonna give Trump the boot. 
Getting Dark Money out of politics is the fight of our time. I’ve made it the fight of my career. You bet I’ll make it the defining issue of my Presidency. 
I may be the underdog in this race, but that's nothing new.As a child raised in a single-parent household.As a lawyer who took on Citizens United ; kicked Dark Money out of our state’s elections.As a Democrat in a place like Montana.I’ve been the underdog before.

In November 2020, we’re going to give Trump the boot. Join us:   
I’m running for President to win back the places we lost and get progressive things done. That’s what I’ve done in Montana, and that's what we’re gonna do across the country.  
 I am damn proud of that whole team, tbh.

I’m in this campaign to beat Donald Trump, to bridge the divides, and to make our economy and Washington work for us againAnd I’m asking you to join me at the Caucus because, together, we can Boot Trump! 
I’m a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who’s won three elections in a red state. I’ve won with Trump on the ballot.I’ve won with Romney on the ballot.And I’ve won with McCain on the ballot.Don’t tell me we can’t win back the places we lost. 
If we can kick the Kochs out of Montana – we can kick them out of Iowa, out of Washington, and all across the country.  We can make Washington work for us again!That’s how we take back our democracy, and give Trump the boot! 
Taking on dark money has been the fight of my career and it’s the challenge of our time. We can win this fight.  With a legislature more republican than yours in Iowa, I took on the Koch Brothers and banned dark money groups from our elections. 
As a former union side labor lawyer, as someone that recognizes blue collar families live and work in places that aren’t always blue on the election maps, that’s how we bring back working folks ; families and retirees in Iowa and across the Midwest and give Trump the boot! 
First, we have to show up. We can’t write off parts of this country, just because it’s tough or because some party boss says it’s a waste of time.   It’s more than just showing up. It’s listening, its understanding, its respecting perspectives that are different than ours. 
89 stops from Mt Pleasant to Mason City. I have listened to you. I have learned from you. And we’ve shared a vision of how we can bridge divides, get our economy and Washington working for Iowans, and how, together, we can boot Donald Trump out of office!
Since getting into this race 5 ½ months ago, I’ve put some miles on these boots. 
It’s boot season. 
Stay tuned... 
Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller is a legendary public servant and a good friend. I'm honored that he'll be in my corner (literally!) on caucus night. Join us:  
 Steve Bullock’s section has “Give Trump The Boot” hand things. May be a line we hear in his speech 
Join us:  
Team Bullock is READY for tonight’s Liberty ; Justice Celebration!   
Thanks to his staff, and his supporters for working your hearts out for a cause you believed in. Democrats are going to need that passion more than ever over the next year. Let's keep up the fight!
Here’s the secret formula for winning three elections in a red state: Show up.Listen. Respect other perspectives. That’s how we win back places we lost. 
This should never be a headline. 
This Administration puts its own interests above those of the American people. 
I know a lot of folks are busy, but please take a moment out of your day to realize that President Trump's attacks on Obamacare are causing a nationwide loss of children’s healthcare — after promising he’d protect it.We’re talking about the lives of American children. 
I’m running for President to get stuff done – and I have a plan and the progressive record to do it. 
It seems like the only way will pay attention to Iowa’s farms is if you tell him that's where the dirt is on a political opponent. 
Here’s what is on the line:Women’s rightsWorkers’ rightsCivil rightsCitizens UnitedDonald Trump is filling the courts with judges that will have a dangerous impact on the direction of our country. It’s time we put a leader in the White House who will fight for our values. 
Happy Halloween from the BOO-lock family to yours! 👻🎃

We win this election by going everywhere, even places that haven’t heard from a Democrat in a while. Everything starts with showing up. Glad to have folks from Newton like Laura on the team!

 You're now comms and Iowa field! People talking to people wins elections
It should scare us all that we still have Dark Money influencing our election.The GOP is terrified to tell us where the money is coming from. So, we’ve unmasked it for them. 
As a former Attorney General, I know criminal activity when I see it. 
Thanks for your contribution. Grassroots donors like you make this possible. 
 "I'm behind you 100 percent," said Anthony Scaramucci in a recent Cameo video he unknowingly recorded for Democratic pre…
It’s time to end the Trump Administration’s attacks on equal opportunity. As President, I’ll make it a priority to empower women, strengthen our communities, and ensure everyone is afforded equal opportunity to succeed. 
Mr. Scaramucci didn’t know the source of the $100, but he allowed it to enter his wallet despite the potential consequences — just like how our broken campaign finance system allows Dark Money to enter our elections ; influence our politics. A frightening tale indeed!
You know what's really spooky this Halloween?The fact that a former Trump White House Communications Director will say anything you ask him to for $100. 
As a former Attorney General, I know criminal activity when I see it. Rudy Giuliani should be behind bars. 
The challenges we face are too great to solve alone — we’ve got to go everywhere and speak with everyone to win back the White House. Tune in to with at 9:20pm MT to hear how we can do just that.
As Attorney General, I fought to ban payday lenders from Montana. As President, Trump offers payday lenders the Lincoln Bedroom. 
This election isn’t up to party bosses or donors. It’s up to voters. 
Despite the Trump administrations fearmongering and hateful policies, we know that diversity makes us strong. In Montana and across this country, we will never stop fighting for those who embody the best of our American values. 
Good. Your turn, Facebook. 
Welcome news from North Carolina, but it’s time we end gerrymandering once ; for all. As President, I’ll work to require every state to establish independent redistricting commissions. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. 
We aren’t just going to beat Donald Trump. We’re going to build a government that actually works again. Glad to have Fmr. Iowa Senate Assistant Majority Leader Staci Appel on our team.  
Here’s a guarantee: There won’t be any of this intolerance coming out of my administration.
People with disabilities have the same right to equal opportunity ; freedom from discrimination as everyone. When we ensure that Americans with disabilities are represented, we can take on prejudice ; build a more equitable world.Here's how we can do it:
Like his casinos, The Apprentice, and his “university,” it’s time we put Trump’s Presidency in the past.
We are witnessing an unprecedented attack on a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions.As Governor of Montana, I stopped every attack on a woman’s right to make those decisions.It’s time for a leader in the White House who will do the same. 
As President, I’ll bring top climate scientists into our government, not force them out. 
Quid pro quo isn't just a term they use in Ukraine. 
As long as SuperPACs and Dark Money groups are able to flood our elections with millions of dollars, we won’t make progress on the big issues facing our country. 
Payday lenders know an easy target when they see one. And they see one sitting in the White House. 
My full statement on Joe Biden's decision to invite help from SuperPACs. 
I’ll oppose:🎟️ Vouchers💰 For-profit charter schools💸 PrivatizationI’ll fight for:🎒 Doubled investments in K-12🖍️ Pre-k for all👩‍🎓 Free community college🏫 Rural schools 
We are building a team in Iowa that knows first hand the fair shot every community deserves.I’m running for President to win back the places we lost ; get progressive things done. That’s what I’ve done in Montana and, with this team, we’re gonna do the same thing across the US. 
Thankful for our brave firefighters who are helping Californians combat their dangerous wildfires. 
We have work to do to make sure that LGBTQ+ Americans have equal rights ; opportunity. Here's our plan:❌ Ban conversion therapy🏳️‍🌈  Pass the Equality Act🇺🇸  Honor ; support transgender Americans who serve in our military⚕️ End healthcare discrimination
Things that are needed to win an election: Dark coffee and dark chocolate.Things that should never be needed to win an election: Dark Money and Super PACs.
I was the first Governor of Montana to officiate a same-sex ceremony. But let’s be clear: marriage equality is just the first step.Together, we can work to ensure freedom from bigotry and intolerance, and guarantee equal rights and opportunity for all.  
Every American deserves a fair shot at success. But for LGBTQ+ Americans, our work did not end with marriage equality. As President, I’ll continue the fight for equal rights and opportunity for every American. 
We have to do more than just win this election — we have to make Washington work for us. Not for Big Money, not for the special interests, but for each one of us in the communities we call home.
It shouldn’t take physically blocking train tracks for a company to pay workers what they’re due. Way to take a stand and get what you earned. 
It’s time we end gerrymandering. 
Despite how much they try, this democracy isn’t for the special interests, Big Money, or Dark Money billionaires. It’s for us.
Pre-K for all.
Missing and murdered Native women, their families, and their communities deserve justice. There is a long road ahead of us, but Hanna's Act is the first step toward addressing this epidemic. 
I stand by my progressive record. As President, I’ll stand with you. 
It’s time we regain America’s competitive education advantage.
My heart goes out to the family of Sen. Kay Hagan. As a passionate fighter for North Carolinians, the strength of her leadership improved opportunity for every American. 
You should be able to register to vote on the day you vote.
Imagine living in a country where some of the wealthiest people on the planet spend millions to influence an election—and don’t have to disclose it. If it sounds familiar it's because that’s what happens in the US. 
I was able to pass Medicaid expansion through a Republican legislature. It saved healthcare for nearly 100,000 folks. It's a stark contrast to this President who uses his power to rip healthcare away from vulnerable Americans. This is why I'm in this fight. Lives are on the line.
Our brave troops put themselves in danger every day to keep us safe. I’m grateful for our special forces who risked their lives and dealt a significant blow to ISIS. 
The economy isn’t working for most folks, and until we break Dark Money’s stranglehold on our politics, it’s not going to.
If we don’t win back the places we lost, we won’t beat Donald Trump. It’s that simple. 
Congressman John Conyers was a passionate leader and a lifelong champion for justice. He fought for civil rights, for voting rights, and for the basic notion that everyone — in every community — deserves a fair shot at a better life.
Trump is doing literally nothing for rural America. 
Happy  Our family hopes all who are celebrating have a wonderful Festival of Lights.
“Our Democratic Party needs a candidate at the top who brings a proven track record and the exceptional qualities to unite our country. That candidate is Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.” — Dave Muhlbauer, Crawford County Supervisor.  
End the filibuster.
Nothing like a little bit of snow to start hunting season in Montana. Stay safe and warm out there! 
Too often, Washington politicians only pay lip service to rural communities. No more.  
This administration isn’t draining the swamp, they’re swamping the drain. 
It’s been 1 year since 11 innocent people lost their lives to gun violence at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. It was true then and it’s true now: anti-Semitism, hate, and violence have no place in America.
Fighting against the toxic influence of money in politics has been the fight of my career. And I’m just getting started.
 That’s the way to do it, Harper!
If you’re a:TeacherFirefighterJanitorPlumberConstruction workerYou pay more in taxes than the 400 wealthiest families in America. That’s not a problem. It’s THE problem.
You bet I’m going to keep  in public hands. Here’s my plan to do just that: 
It’s time we get stuff done for the folks Washington left behind. Glad to have Don Ruby, Former Warren County Democratic Party Chair in this fight with us!  
Election Day should be a national holiday.
The way I win and the way I govern are largely the same. It’s about listening more than you talk and  going everywhere, even places that haven’t heard from a Democrat in a while. Everything starts with showing up.
As a former union-side labor lawyer, and as someone who stood on the picket line with I‘ve seen how much these agreements mean for workers and their families.This is about securing better wages, benefits, and job security. It’s about a fair shot at a better life. 
Trump's tax giveaway to big corporations is exploding our deficit and making future generations pick up the tab.

I won three elections in a red state, and never once compromised on:✅ Workers’ rights✅ Civil rights✅ Women’s rightsWe can win back the places we lost and still get progressive things done. 
As a former Attorney General let me make this clear: no one is above the law. 
I don’t have the luxury of only going to pockets of blue or making plans for the sake of press releases — I have to get things done.So when I say we're going to show up everywhere, listen more than we talk, and deliver on our plans, I mean it. 
 Thank you for making Arkansas a priority on your Presidential campaign Governor Bullock   
You don’t get to claim you care about corruption when your budget cuts programs to combat corruption. 
When you see the effects of climate change firsthand, you see that inaction is no longer an option.That's why as Governor I led on expanding clean energy solutions, quadrupling our solar and doubling wind generation.
I’m a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who won three elections in a red state — not by compromising our values — but by fighting like hell to deliver results.⁣ It’s the same way we’re going to win back the White House. 
This election is about connecting with voters — not using gimmicks to chase big donors. 
“Our Democratic Party needs a nominee who can fix Washington and get it back to work. That candidate is Montana Governor Steve Bullock.” - Don Ruby, Former Warren County Democratic Party Chair
We need to win back places we lost. We need to give people a reason to vote for us, not just against Trump. We need to make people believe our government can work. That’s what we did in Montana, and I know we can do it across our country. 
I’ll keep this one short: 
In Montana, we do late night snacks a little differently. Be bear aware everyone!
Here’s how we can protect voter rights, stop foreign interference, and defend our democracy: 
Of all things, election security should not be a partisan issue – this is about protecting our democracy. 
 “Shared ownership and stewardship of our public lands is a fundamental part of what it means to be an American,” said
 Letter to editor:  Bullock good neighbor in snowstorm 
A History of Trickle-down economics:It didn’t work in the 1980s.It didn’t work in the early 2000s.It doesn’t work now. 
Our farmers don’t need Trump’s false promises and tweets. They need trade. 
Everyone: Election interference, white supremacy, and lying is bad.FB: Yeah we agree.Everyone: So will you take lies off your platform?FB: ...repeat the question?Everyone: Will you please remove false or hateful ads?FB: Sorry... we're making a lot of money on Trump.
Coming from a rural state, this is personal to me.2/3 of American counties lost businesses in the last decade.  We aren't going to win back theses places until we put forward bold ideas and take action.Here's how I'll do it:  
Trump’s handouts to Big Oil are more than a broken promise. He’s systematically undermining the success of rural communities across America.I stand in support of our corn farmers and producers. This has got to end.
Whether Trump's removed at the ballot box or through an impeachment proceeding, we’ve got to recognize the next President will have to heal the great divides across our country. That's what I've done as Governor. I'll do the same as President. 
America deserves better than President Donald Trump — and we can beat him in 2020. But we’ve got to speak to the folks Washington has left behind, and tackle the concerns that keep them up at night. I'm on to talk about how we can do just that. Tune in!
It’s an honor to join this morning. As President, I will work alongside our Tribes to build opportunities to help us all move forward.When Indian Country succeeds, America succeeds. 
Let’s be clear: the President is focused on helping the wealthy and big corporations, not working families. 
🎃 
Trump is running his administration like he runs his businesses. Poorly. 
Make no mistake: the fight against Big Money is the defining issue of our time.I’ll make it the defining issue as President.
Partisan divides are not an excuse for progress to stop. 
I'm in this race because voices in these communities are getting lost.If we don't show up. If we don't listen. If we don't take back the places we lost, Trump will win. And that means nothing will get better.We can't lose sight of that. 5/5
It's clear there’s a major disconnect between what goes on in DC and what is happening out here.The bickering. The politicking. The inaction. Nothing is getting done and it's hurting folks.Partisan divides are not an excuse for progress to stop. Trust me. 4/5
After 14 trips across Iowa, it wasn’t a surprise to hear their concerns.What did surprise me was that, with so many candidates in this race, I’m one of the few who has actually visited the county this election. 3/5

World Series seats.Tickets to Broadway shows.Literally just giving away money.We're fooling ourselves if we think any of this helps us beat Trump.
It ain't the World Series, but if you come to the cross town game in Helena this weekend I'll buy you a Coke.  
Quid pro quo - /ˌkwid ˌprō ˈkwō/ - noun:A favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something. 
Russia wins.Turkey wins.This is what happens when the President uses American foreign policy for his own gain. 
A despicable comparison. The President is equating a constitutional check on his abuse of power to acts of domestic terrorism that took the lives of thousands of Americans. 
A sixth generation farmer in Rippey, Iowa, told me that when Trump tweets, they lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.We deserve more than an ego-driven trade war from a New York con man.It's time we have a President that works for us.
As Governor, I fought to keep public lands in public hands. It’s time we send someone to the White House who will protect these special places so we can pass them on to the next generation. 
Big Money rules our political system in this country.It’s time to do something about it. 
We can win this election.But we have to step back and start focusing on the problems folks face in their everyday lives.Thank you Council Bluffs for showing up and doing the work to move this country forward. 
When we show up, listen, and prove to folks that we are ready to fight for them, we win. 
Rural families deserve a President who understands their needs. Grateful to the folks and the work they do to power rural communities with safe, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy. 
It’s time we have a President who will protect our public lands. 
More than a year ago, I asked Donald Trump what he's doing to end the gun violence epidemic in our country.His answer wasn't good enough then — and his leadership isn't good enough now. 
The President:- Gives tax handouts to big corporations- Guts environmental protections- Starts an ego-driven trade war- Abandons our allies abroad- Rips healthcare away from families- Locks children in cages- Emboldens white nationalistsAnd so much more… 
I am a hunter and a gun owner.No hunter needs a 30-round magazine, a bump stock, or an assault weapon. A large majority of Americans – Republican and Democrat – agree. 
This is why protecting our public lands is reel important. 
 Okay, I’ll come back tomorrow then!
Everything starts with showing up. 
This isn’t hard to understand:- Corporations are making record profits.- 60% of Americans haven’t had a pay increase in real terms in 40 years.- The President makes it worse with handouts to the wealthy. Folks are tired of waiting. It’s time for a change. 
I’m a pro-choice, pro-union Democrat who won three elections in a red state.I didn’t do it by compromising our progressive values. I did it by getting stuff done.
 leads the Department of Education but favors privatizing our public schools.She works for a President who ran a fraudulent for-profit "university" that stole millions from students.Yeah, I’d say we’re in trouble.
Good. You can't use the Presidency to sell timeshares at your golf resort. 
We must have accountability. 
It’s far past time we put an end to Citizens United.
It’s a problem when the Acting White House Chief of Staff sounds more like a marketing official for Trump Resorts than someone who serves us. We need leaders fighting for working folks, not this President’s bottom line. 
It’s time we have a voice for Rural America in DC. As President I won’t just talk about it, I’ll take action. Here’s how:  
Donald Trump is the textbook case of failing upwards.
Godspeed 1-189th, Montana National Guard. 
“I see Steve as being the candidate that can most effectively address that issue of Dark Money, because he has done it.” - Cecille from Johnston, Iowa Join us:  
We deserve a President who tells the truth. Our kids are watching. 
We can beat him at the ballot box.He can be impeached.Regardless, we have to move forward, restore integrity to the Oval Office, and heal the divisions across our country. 
Congratulations to and Montana's own for making history in space today!
We've got 108 days before a single voter expresses their preference in this election — and 8 months before we pick our nominee. We're going to show up ; speak with folks every day.That's how we win the  in February.It's how we win everywhere in November 2020. 
The security and credibility of the United States is on the line, and Trump’s recklessness is to blame. 
Big Money in politics.Dark Money in politics.SuperPAC billionaires in politics.Seems like the smart solution is getting rid of all that money in politics.

Here’s something Fox News’ and I actually agree on. 
Union members who've worked their whole lives could lose their pensions because of inaction by Washington politicians. This is wrong. 
Whether Trump's removed at the ballot box or through an impeachment proceeding, we’ve got to recognize the next President will have to heal the great divides across our country.That's what I've done as Governor. I'll do the same as President. 
The press conference with Mick Mulvaney today sure sounded like an infomercial for Trump resorts—and when you pair it with footage from Doral, it's exactly what you get.

I’m on with talking about the issues that matter most — and how I’m going to share my vision of a fair shot with everyone. Tune in!
Congressman Elijah Cummings was a courageous moral leader and a relentless advocate for a better world.Our thoughts are with the Congressman's family and loved ones today.
He puts his name on his buildings.He puts his name on his failing businesses.He puts himself over those he should serve.We put his name on a website that he can’t hide from.
When a top GOP strategist says that “you will wipe out Trump” you’re doing something right. 
The White House should not be run by a failed businessman on Twitter.
Enough talk.It’s far past time we kick Dark Money out of our elections.
 workers want job security, better wages, and good benefits. With GM making record profits, this isn't asking too much. I stand with the workers. 
It’s difficult to “care about corruption” when you run the Presidency like an incompetent mobster.
Instead of helping farmers combat the climate crisis, the GOP buries its head in the sand — or in this context, flooded farmland.
“Steve Bullock frightens me” — David Urban, a top Donald Trump advisor. I’d say that’s a good thing. 
President Trump promised to save manufacturing.Then he spent his time giving tax handouts to his wealthy friends and using a sledge hammer approach to trade.Here’s the result:

It’s not rocket science: 60% of Americans haven’t had a pay increase in real terms in 40 years.It’s time for a change. 
We face big challenges: the economy, healthcare, and climate change to name a few.To make real progress, we need to take on the corrupting influence of Big Money.It's the defining issue of our time.I'll make it the defining issue of my Presidency.

Donald Trump is enriching himself and his family. Make no mistake: we’re paying for it. 
President Trump must publicly and unequivocally condemn the gruesome video shown at his resort this weekend and the hate that inspired it.Unfortunately, I'm not holding my breath for a rational response from the President. 
Reminder: Donald Trump is still trying to take healthcare away from American families. 
*Unless someone has dirt on a political opponent. 
For those who want to make progress on climate — not to mention reduce gun violence, raise wages, and more — the fight against Big Money is the defining issue of our time.I’ll make it the defining issue as President.

I started my career as a labor lawyer. I fought alongside unions to protect the rights of workers — and the livelihoods of American families.We need more than just talk from the White House. We need action. 
This race is about making sure working families have a fair shot again. This administration isn't doing it — but working together, we will. I’m glad to join in this fight. Watch live: 
I don’t have the luxury of making plans for the sake of press releases — as a Governor, I have to answer to my neighbors and get things done for my state.So when I say we’ll deliver on the promises I make, I mean it. 
 In addition to wanting to save representative democracy, we share that in common as well Jeremy!
We’re here in Boone County, Iowa — a place that flipped to Trump in 2016 after voting for Obama in 2008 and 2012. We can take these places back — and it starts with showing up.

Trump gets no credit for delaying more of his disastrous tariffs. What we got yesterday was a half-measure that doesn't begin to fix the bigger challenges we have with China. His ego-driven trade policy is failing our farmers ; ranchers and creating more uncertainty for families.
It’s true. I also like: ✅ Expanding healthcare to nearly 1 in 10 Montanans.✅ Passing the most progressive anti-Dark Money law in the country.✅ Securing record investments in education.Join us:  
We fought Dark Money — and we won. If we can do that for elections in Montana, we can do that nationwide.
As a graduate of the same public schools my three kids now attend, I know our task is straightforward: we have to invest in our teachers. 
This election is about beating Donald Trump, but it’s also about making people believe that the economy and our political system can work for all of us. 
We must do more than defeat Donald Trump. We have to make Washington work for us — for our kids and for our future.

Trump's tax giveaway to corporations is exploding our deficit and leaving future generations to pay the price.
The average worker hasn’t had a real wage increase in 40 years. Yet companies like Amazon make record profits while paying nothing in taxes. Trump's policies favor the wealthy and well-connected, not working families.
 He probably blocks the lift line too. 
We’re going to go everywhere. We’re going to speak with everyone. That’s how we win:  
It’s snowing in Montana right now, so I’m just going to say it:Donald Trump skis in jeans.
Need more evidence that Big Money is corrupting Washington? The wealthiest pay less taxes than the most vulnerable among us, and Trump is only making it worse. 
Trump is abandoning our allies who fought with us against ISIS.He is undermining American leadership in the world.The security and credibility of the United States is on the line, and his recklessness is to blame. 
 Wow. Go, Montana.  Trump trails Bullock in Montana but leads other top 2020 Democrats | TheHill

If we can kick Dark Money out of Montana’s elections, we can do it across the country. It’s time to get to work.
As the world watches, Trump has abandoned our allies who fought against ISIS and undermined American leadership. He is again ignoring the advice of our military and diplomatic leaders — all without a strategy.The safety and credibility of the United States is on the line.

When you realize you’re the only candidate who wears cowboy boots in the Presidential race. 
We cannot allow any President – or any party – to jeopardize our national security for their own personal political gain. 
Let’s be clear: we win the election by making a fair shot at a better life available to all Americans. And that’s only possible when we take on the toxic influence of money in politics.

  A crazy idea to get things done in Washington
The rule in Washington is fundraising first, and everything else second. It's time for that to change.
Here’s an idea:At the end of an election, every federal elected official should be required to stop campaigning. They shouldn't be able to re-start a campaign until half-way through the term of the office they hold. In other words, until they do their job.

If we’re going to stop the epidemic of gun violence and save our democracy, then we must stop groups like the NRA from buying influence in the first place.

Public lands belong to all of us. As President, I’ll keep it that way: 
More proof that the NRA is nothing more than a Dark Money-fueled political organization bent on further dividing this country. 
When this administration threatened Montana’s public lands we made our voices loud and clear. It’s time we have a plan to match it.

60% of Americans haven’t had a pay increase in real terms in 40 years.This is the consequence of policies that favor the wealthiest rather than working families.
We deserve better than Citizens United.

As President, I’ll restore trusted leadership to Washington by putting an end to these waivers that favor the largest oil companies, advancing renewable research and development, and empowering ag workers to lead our country forward. 
A third renewable fuel plant in Iowa has been forced to cut their operations as Trump blows off his administration’s own energy recommendations. Farmers and producers have been forced to the brink under Trump.

Yes. I’m a single-issue voter in this race. We need to make sure Donald Trump is a one-term President and when it comes to winning back places we’ve lost, I’m the only candidate who's able to say, “I've done it.” 
I’ll keep this short: I stand with the workers. A company making record profits should pay its employees their fair share. 
✅Expanded healthcare to nearly one in ten Montanans ✅Passed the most progressive anti-Dark Money laws in the country✅Record investments in education If we can do it in Montana, we can do it everywhere. 
Our next Secretary of Education should fight for our teachers, not debt collectors.
I can’t picture a better way to follow up a steak fry than with a BBQ with Story County Dems. By showing up and talking with everyone, we’re going to win in 2020. 
 Represent Riley!
“The man who is best suited to the position of President out of the slate of candidates is our own Governor Steve Bullock. He has served well and effectively as chief executive in state government, with the Senate and House stacked against him heavily."
We’re going to go everywhere. Listen more than we talk. Bring back the folks who feel left behind. Then, we’re going to win.If we get to grab a bite at Ski’s Sandwich Shop and a beer from Carroll Brewing Company on the way, that’s just a bonus. 
 Of joy?
Taking the show on the road 🎶 Sioux City ➡️ Carroll ➡️ Nevada 
As I’ve said before, JD is living proof that when you go everywhere and talk with everyone, there's nowhere we can't compete.Now more than ever, we have to take every opportunity to kick hatred out of the halls of Congress — and is going to do it in  
Thanks to for a great gathering. They’re changing the face of politics in Iowa, and building a strong network of Democratic women who are leading today and tomorrow. 
I refuse to cede the votes of rural America. As if folks that work the land, feed the world, and pass the plate on Sunday’s somehow are forever wedded to a lying con man from New York with orange hair and a golden toilet. 
It’s not just Donald Trump on the ballot next November.Representative democracy is on the ballot.Indeed, the American Dream is on the ballot. 
We need a President at the top of the ticket who will help us win back the places we lost. Even if that literally means helping some of them get out of the mud. 
The President of the United States should stand up for working families and the unions who defend them — not the Dark Money groups doing the dirty work of corporations and big donors. 
Serving up cold ones after flipping steaks.  
I like mine medium rare.
Just a friendly reminder that our President likes his steaks well done and with ketchup.  
 get it right: Steaks not corporate tax breaks.   
One hell of a team!   
Hoping the  has a talent show. 
 The Iowa operation at the steak fry—&gt; 
Small business owners like Paul in Newton, Iowa and across this country want a President that will work for them, not big donors. 
It’s time we get rid of the corrupting influence of money in our elections.That’s the fight of our time. It’s been the fight of my career.
Public education is one of our country’s great equalizers. As President, I’ll make sure that no matter your zip code, every child has the opportunity to get a great education. 
Just a reminder: the GOP is the only major political party in the world that won’t acknowledge climate change is human caused. 
Show up. Listen. That’s how we bring folks together, win back the places we lost, and get this country back on track. 
Trump has done lasting damage to our standing in the world and to the basic norms we expect from the highest office in the land. As President, I’ll re-engage our allies and restore American leadership in the community of nations.
This is the same guy who gushed about love letters from a North Korean dictator, shared highly classified intelligence with Russian intelligence operatives in the Oval Office, and sided with Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence community.
Trump's actions are a threat to our nation's security and our constitutional order — and Americans deserve better from our President.
Repeatedly pressuring the leader of a foreign nation to investigate a political opponent is behavior you’d expect from an incompetent mobster — not the President of the United States. 
"A number of top Bill Clinton alums have been urging Bullock to keep going, seeing parallels between his small, conservative state background ; governing record —and late start — that excite them."
Folks deserve leaders in DC who work for them and aren't just trying to win their next campaign.As President, I'll do something about it.
 You should be a bit more sheepish about tweeting like this...
I’ll keep this short: public lands belong in public hands. 
 Montana Gov. Bullock on climate change: "We can't address this by one individual and by executive order alone." 
When you see the effects of climate change firsthand, you see that inaction is no longer an option.The next generation is making their voice heard across the world for the  time for all our leaders to take action. 
There’s only one right answer here: climate change is a global threat. We must take immediate and durable action to combat it.Tune into the   at 10:15 ET to join the discussion about how we address this problem now.





Classy? Don't get me started on record: 
I’m a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who won three elections in a red state — not by compromising our values — but by fighting like hell to deliver results.⁣It’s the same way we’re going to win back the White House. 
Drain the swamp?This President looks out for his donors and the wealthy, not the rest of us.Washington is broken. Getting Big Money out of politics is the first step in how we fix it.
Thank you for holding this town hall! As President, I won't just talk. I'll take action.That means:📚  Double federal investment in K-12🏫  Oppose vouchers ; the privatization of public schools🎒  Free tuition for community college❌ Remove Betsy DeVos 
 My Secretary of Education will advocate for public ed, not dismantle it. - 
 I had a shot at the American dream, from delivering papers to the Governor’s mansion to living in it. - 
I’m standing with because we must make a real investment in our teachers, students, and our public schools. 
We live in a time where white supremacy is on the rise. We have a President that empowers it. It’s time we elect leaders that are loud and clear on this point: there is no room for hate in the United States of America. 
This race is a marathon, not a sprint. We have strong grassroots support and an incredible team on the ground. This campaign is built to go the distance.
Our fight is for workers’ rights.Our fight is for equal rights.It’s a fight for our democracy and against Dark Money. 
He shreds protections for the air we breathe and the water we drink.He guts healthcare services and attacks Obamacare.  He separates families and locks children in cages. November 2020, we make sure he is a one-term President.
As Governor, I stopped every attack on a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions.Standing up for these rights has never been more urgent. Trump’s actions are an attack on women and families across our country. 
As Iowa floods, Trump sits on his hands. As Florida battled Hurricane Dorian, Trump was playing at his golf resort. put away the clubs and do your job.
The energy industry and climate deniers have full rein in Washington, and Trump shows no remorse so long as they bankroll his reelection.
My thoughts are with western Iowa as they withstand another wave of flooding.Until we take durable action on climate change, this will only get worse: more flooded farms, businesses underwater, and towns struggling to rebuild ; retain their communities.
Folks across the country are seeing higher prices at the grocery store because of Trump’s trade war. This makes it that much tougher for working families to put food on the table.We need action from the President – not more political games. 
This is the fight of our time. It’s been the fight of my career. As President, it will be my top priority.Join us:  
The economy isn’t working for most folks — and until we get Dark Money out of politics it’s not going to. 
"Whomever the Democrats ultimately choose, Bullock provides examples of the strengths they should be looking for." 
I asked my 12-year-old son what he learned in his first week at a new school. He said he learned where to go if there's a shooting.No kid should have to go through this. I’m grateful for the work is doing to  and  
When we have the courage to stand up and fight the corrupt influence of Dark Money in our elections, we can win and make real change happen. We did it in Montana and we can do it across the country.
When you show up and listen, it's easy to realize that there's more that unites us than divides us. 
The Constitution has been our Democracy's guiding light for the last 232 years. Now more than ever, we need a President and an administration that respects the rule of law and our basic American values.  
This administration gives handouts to the wealthy and corporations because that’s what they ask for.They gut environmental protections because that’s what polluters request.All of this while the President divides us.That’s not the promise of America. We deserve more. 
CC: 
I’m also called “endearingly corny” from time to time. 
Today is a good day. 
Dark Money groups flood our elections with money and influence to stop DC politicians from taking even the first step to address climate change.If we’re going to solve this crisis, we need to get Big Money out of politics. Period.
And we won. 
Guaranteeing a living wage has never been a fringe issue for me. Before I ran for office, I led the fight to raise my state's minimum wage and index it to inflation. 
Don’t just abide, donate ⬇️ 
Here’s how I’ll do it:  ✅ $15 minimum wage ✅ Strengthen Social Security ✅ Paid family and medical leave ✅ End the assault on unions
The facts are clear: 60% of Americans haven’t had a pay increase in real terms in 40 years.While the President gives handouts to the wealthy, corporations, and his donors, American livelihoods are being destroyed.It’s time for that to change.
As Governor, I passed one of the strongest campaign disclosure laws in the country and banned the use of foreign money in elections.Our elections should belong to people, and no one else.Join us:  
ANWR is one of the most pristine places on our planet. Donald Trump, Republican leaders, and Dark Money groups representing the energy industry are taking us backward by gutting pollution standards and expanding drilling.
As we celebrate  let’s recognize the many cultural and economic contributions Hispanic Americans have made to this country. Our diversity makes America stronger.
“It’s only a buck, man!”Thanks for your support and kind words Don’t just abide, donate:  
As a former union-side labor lawyer, I know how difficult of a decision this is for hardworking folks and their families. They deserve better wages, benefits, and job security. A company generating record profits should pay workers their fair share. 
The number one priority has to be kicking Dark Money out of politics. It’s capturing Washington DC.It’s corrupting our elections. As President, I’ll change it on Day One. 
A few things that have increased in the Trump administration:The deficit.The number of farmer bankruptcies.Folks without health insurance.The number of hate crimes. Those are just facts. It’s time for that to change. 
As elected officials we have to recognize that our kids are watching. We need to give them something to aspire to and be inspired by.This President isn’t up to the task. 
I’m running for President to get rid of the corrupting influence of Dark Money.All of it.
This campaign isn't just about defeating Donald Trump — it's about defeating the corrupt system that he surrounds himself with and that keeps him in power. All at our expense. This has been the fight of my career, and I'm not stopping now. 
It’s time for this President to get off the golf course, and get to work for the American people. 
We found a solution to sharpie problem. 
Washington DC hasn’t passed a budget on time in 22 years. So I’d say this is pretty spot on: 
When you’re called the “Biggest Threat to Citizens United,” you’re doing something right. Getting rid of the toxic influence of Dark Money in politics has been the fight of my career, and we’re just getting started.
Just remember that President Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a blind trust.
Hide the sharpies. 
The sad part is between Putin, Kim Jong Un, and others... there is no way to know which one he’d be talking about. 
“Of all the Presidential hopefuls who have promised to oust Donald Trump in 2020, Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, has perhaps the most compelling electoral record.” 
142 days until the first votes are cast. See you in Iowa!  
 Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the day was had to polish off that plate alone!
 Meeting Caucus-goers and taking selfies.   
After Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited money in our elections, Democrats in Washington didn’t change anything.  They spoke about it. They raised money off it. But nothing got done.As President, I’ll take action on Day One.
This morning I’m joining for a conversation about how to ensure every child in Iowa and across the country gets a fair shot. Tune in now:  
If we want to get anything done, we need to start by getting the corrupting influence of money out of our elections. This is the fight of our time, and it’s been the fight of my career — and I’m going to keep fighting until we win.
I’m the only candidate in this field who has led the fight against money in politics and with real victories to show for it.
This election is about making our economy and democracy work for the millions of Americans that DC has left behind. That will be virtually impossible if we can’t end the toxic influence of money in politics, and there wasn’t a single question asked about how we’re going to do it.
Montana's legislature is nearly 60% Republican. But we still kicked Dark Money out of our elections, froze college tuition, ; expanded healthcare to nearly 1 out of 10 people.If we can do it in Montana, we can do it everywhere.Join us:  
I’m a gun owner. I hunt.I also stand with one needs a 30-round magazine, a bump stock, or an assault weapon. 
We won’t win this election by only talking about Donald Trump. It’s about solving the problems that people face everyday. 
They're going to need more than a sharpie to hide from this one. 
Trump's Senior Campaign Adviser: “Steve Bullock frightens me.”When we talk about issues that matter to American's everyday lives, we’ll win — and Donald Trump knows it. 
Trump’s trade war is hitting rural communities hard and costing farmers billions. Every farmer I know wants it to end and we need to have their backs. Democrats should stand with farmers against Trump’s disastrous tariffs, not make things worse. 
See you in Iowa today, and over the next 143 days!
As a kid, my grandpa took me to GA to teach me about a rural state Gov running for president.He wasn't registering high in the polls.He didn't have name recognition.He was running on experience outside DC.Folks called him a long shot, but he was in it to win it.So am I. 
We’re going to go everywhere.Listen more than we talk.Bring back the folks who feel left behind.Then, we’re going to get Dark Money out of politics and make government work again. Join us:  
 Ditto
I refuse to cede the votes of places off the coasts and those that voted for Obama then Trump.
Glad to have leadership on our team!See you tomorrow, Iowa! 
It’s no surprise given this administration’s constant attempts to gut Obamacare. As President, I’ll build on our progress and make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone. 
Addressing the needs of Americans with disabilities will be one of my top priorities as President. 
 Bengals sweep Bozeman in 3. 25-18, 25-23, 25-15. Great Falls Invitational this weekend. 
Our economy is more than GDP and yield curves.It's over 300 million Americans making decisions every day around their kitchen table. And Trump is making things worse. 
Every worker should be able to count on fair wages, benefits, and working conditions — including independent contractors. 
Here’s how we build an economy that gives everyone a fair shot at a better life: 
It didn’t work in the 1980s.It didn’t work in the early 2000s.It doesn’t work now. 
This anniversary also reminds us that there is more that unites our nation than divides us.  Let us pause to pay respect to those that were lost, to thank first responders, and to remember that together, we as Americans are resilient.
Many of us remember exactly where we were and each detail of September 11, 2001.  We must never forget the stories of that day, those that we lost, the heroes, and the first responders.
 gave it his all and made us proud. But if we don’t connect with rural voters — if we don’t show up in 2020 and win these places back — then Trump wins. 
Future generations deserve to enjoy our  just as we did. We have to protect them. 
We have to return to a time when the President and his administration respects the rule of law and the limits of that power.
This was a good break from the campaign trail — thanks
One of the GOP’s top strategists just said that our campaign gives “Republican campaign managers the biggest heart attack.” 
 He also has great people working with him... looking at you Go get 'em!
Folks in  the choice in this election is clear. is the candidate that will fight for affordable healthcare, better jobs, and a real investment in public schools. Don't sit this one out. Your vote matters.

Hate to see it 
The fight against Dark Money has been the fight of my career. It’s the fight of our time — and the fight of this election.Together, we can win.
This is the most important election of our lifetime. No, I’m not just saying that. 
Big Pharma’s dollars have no place in our politics.
Trump’s Trade War must end.
Ban the use of AI to surveil employees.
It’s time for Washington to stop treating rural America like flyover country.  
It should not be illegal for the government to negotiate drug prices.
At the end of the day, this race is going to be decided by voters on the ground and not party leaders in Washington. I will continue taking my case directly to the voters as we fight for a fair shot for every American.
This process is failing Democrats and does nothing to help us beat Donald Trump next November. People deserve a democratic process that elevates candidates based on the strength of their experience and ideas — not the size of their bank accounts.
At this point, there isn’t much left to be said regarding a set of rules that have allowed a billionaire to bankroll his way on to the debate stage, while Governors and Senators with decades of public service experience have been forced out of the race.
As the only Governor in this race, I’ll tell you with certainty: Governors actually have to get sh*t done. 
Donald Trump is on track to tax virtually everything imported from China by Christmas. American families are going to pay more out of pocket because our President values his ego over our wellbeing.
Trump’s Trade War is a tax on American families.
Some say the idea of the American Dream is dead. But I believe in an America where every child has a fair shot to do better than their parents — and I refuse to give up without a fight.
When I was a kid, 90% of 30 year olds were doing better than their parents did at that age. Today, it’s less than half.  60% of Americans have not had a pay increase in real terms in 40 years. ⅔ of our counties lost businesses over the past decade.
As we watch sea ice melt and fire seasons grow longer, the GOP remains the only major political party in the world that denies climate change is human caused. 
 Call me Steve anytime.  Great to join you this morning!
The Dark Money pouring into our government has landed us with a broken economy and a corrupt political system. I’m on with to talk about how we can make Washington work again. Tune in.
I am a hunter and a gun owner.No hunter needs a 30-round magazine, a bump stock, or an assault weapon.
We deserve a President who gets sh*t done.
Until we address the fact that the rules are now written for those with the biggest checkbooks, many of the promises and plans you’re hearing about are just talk.  We’ve TALKED about the problem of the corrupting influence of money in politics for too long. It’s time to act.
As Democrats, we win when we offer something better.  When we show up, listen, and focus on the challenges of everyday Americans. That’s what I’m doing every day of this campaign — and I hope you join me.  LIVE from New Hampshire: 
Rather than having the backs of working folks, Trump’s only solution is to pour gasoline on the fires of hatred and division — and he’s made the swamp worse today than almost anytime in the past.  
 But Donald Trump is a symptom, not the cause, of a government and an economy that no longer works for most folks in this country.  
I’m here at the Convention because we have to make sure Donald Trump is a one-term President. 
We beat them in court, and they keep at it.They will never stop trying to overrun our democracy with money by empowering donors at the expense of voters.My administration will put a stop to it once and for all.
We can fix this broken economy and broken political system. Because it’s not just Donald Trump on the ballot next November. The American Dream is on the ballot.
Too often, Washington politicians only pay lip service to rural communities. No more.

I'm not just throwing out lofty plans that can't be implemented. Rural America deserves more than that —   and that's why my plan is specific, achievable, and paid for. 
We cannot be a party that only serves the coasts.

It’s time to get sh*t done. Last night on 
Rural America is more than flyover country. It’s time Washington started acting like it.

We can't wait to address the climate crisis. We need immediate action.We also can't leave behind the workers who have powered our country for generations. 
If we end the Trade War, we can actually invest in rural America. My plan: 
Trump’s Trade War costs Iowans over $1 billion each year in added expenses alone. No more. The first step towards ensuring a fair shot for rural Americans: ending the Trade War.
In this election, we deserve more than just theoretical policy plans. They should be concrete, paid for, and address the real challenges folks face in their everyday lives. Here’s mine: 
Folks shouldn't have to leave their home or community to succeed in America.When I’m President, they won’t have to. Read my plan for a Fair Shot for Rural America:   
It’s time for an Office of Rural Affairs in the White House.
We’ve got to do more than pay lip service to small towns and rural America. Here’s my plan:  
My plan for a Fair Shot for Rural America: 
It’s time to crack down on companies like Exxon and Chevron who continue to be given free passes by the Trump administration.
The challenges rural Americans face aren't theoretical. They're an experience I've lived — and I'm going to bring that perspective to the Oval Office. 
Obamacare was the greatest expansion of healthcare since Medicaid ; Medicare — and despite Trump’s constant sabotage, it's working. 90% of Americans now have health insurance.  We should be building on this progress ; get to 100% coverage — not tearing it down ; starting over.
I went from delivering newspapers to the Governor’s residence to raising our three kids in it. I got my shot at the American Dream. But for a whole lot of Americans, that opportunity no longer exists — and it’s time we acknowledge that, for far too many, it never has.
Donald Trump is not the promise of America. 
 THIS WEEK: We’re back with Bill Hader, and 
I'm the Governor of a red state. I hunt. Real hunters support background checks. 
The GOP is the only major political party in the world that won’t acknowledge climate change is human caused. 
It should be illegal for employers to use social media or AI to surveil their employees’ organizing efforts. 
I know we can do it. But we’ve got to start offering real solutions to the problems folks face in their everyday lives instead of waiting for a revolution that may not come.
If we don’t change our strategy — if we don’t win back the places that voted for Trump by giving folks a reason to vote for us, not just against him — then he’ll be spending another four years in the White House.
With the help of American workers, we’re going to take back the White House.
Our challenge next November is to defeat a president who said he’d have worker’s backs, then embraced an agenda that prioritizes special interests. We have to do more than just go to the patches of blue to beat him.  We have to win back places we lost.
Hope everybody had a Labor Day full of family, barbecue, and maybe a beer or two 🍻 
Folks aren’t asking for government to give them anything for free. All we want is a fair shot.
I am a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who has won three elections in a red state—not by compromising our values, but by bringing people together and fighting like hell to deliver results.
We need a leader ready to engage in diplomacy with the rest of the world. Not just tweet at it.
Happy  Dubuque! 
What we need to know: 1️⃣ Trump’s tariffs are a tax on American families. 2️⃣ On Election Day, we can put an end to it.
For decades, American workers have been playing defense. Too much of your time and energy is spent fending off attack after attack on the rights you’ve fought for, won, and deserve. We should all be tired of playing defense. When I’m President, we’re going back on offense.
Together we can beat the
I started my career as a union-side labor lawyer — and I’m running for President to keep fighting for the folks I represented all those years ago. 
I stopped every attempt to strip away workers’ rights in a state that voted for Trump by 20 points.If we can do it in Montana, we can do it everywhere. 
As these miners in KY remind us — there is a real human toll of transitioning to a clean energy economy. Their battle is not a political one. Regardless of party, we’ve all got to stand with them on this Labor Day and always. 
Florida, Puerto Rico, and all those in  path: stay safe, stay alert, and follow instructions from and local law enforcement. For more tools to ready for Dorian’s landfall:

We have to do more than just win this election — we have to make Washington work for us. Not for Big Money, not for the special interests, but for each one of us in the communities we call home.
Last night, 10 people were shot in Alabama. We are going to learn more about what happened tonight in Midland — but what we do know is that countless lives were changed forever. This is not normal.

Farmers’ livelihoods are being threatened in Iowa, and across the country, while Trump wages a trade war. These political games have got to stop, and they have to stop now.
We’ve got 5 and a half months before a single voter casts their ballot — and we’re going to get out and talk with them every day. 
Let’s be clear: I’ll appoint someone who has taught in a classroom as Secretary of Education, not someone like Betsy DeVos. That means opposing vouchers and the privatization of public schools.
Hey — next time you’re in Decorah, you’ve got to stop in to The Sugar Bowl Ice Cream Company.  Highly recommend the Salted Caramel! 
I’m going to make taking on the toxic influence of money in politics a national priority. It’s time someone does.
Our economy isn't just about GDP and yield curves or enriching your family, donors, and corporations. We have to focus on fixing the problems more than 300 million folks face in the here and now.

Grateful to have State Rep. and County Supervisor Mark Campbell in my corner —   both folks from counties that we need to win back in 2020. Together, we'll win back their communities and places just like them across the country.
We need to prioritize improving care in rural and underserved communities — and increasing access to quality healthcare. My plan to do it: 
Access to healthcare should not depend on the size of your paycheck. It should be a right for all.
We deserve a president who values the truth.
Dr. King was right — that dream isn’t a guarantee, but a promissory note. We have to fight for it. The American Dream is on the line on this election. We cannot fail it.

Donald Trump is taxing our farmers to pay for his ego-driven trade war. Our next generation deserves better. 
 I'll see you tonight. Catch me on r/IAmA at 7 pm ET for my first AMA as a Presidential candidate!
In four days, the FEC will officially be powerless to protect our elections.Our democracy is on the line. It’s time to fix this — now.
Grateful for the work  does each and every day. Paying our interns $15.40 an hour is a question of living our values — it's as simple as that.
For too long, we've been talking over  instead of listening to them. No more. Together with Ms. Teehee, the Cherokee Nation, and every voice from Indian Country, we can make Washington work for everyone. 
🍎 Froze college tuition.🍎 Made record investment in K-12 education.🍎 Saved families more than $5 million through dual-enrollment initiatives. If we can do it in Montana, we can do it everywhere.

“[Bullock] brings some assets that are unique in the overstuffed Democratic field and should be considered by those who want nothing more than to defeat Donald Trump next year.”
Climate change is a threat to our very way of life.We must take action now.
One day, this President will have to answer the question of whether he's giving our kids something to aspire to and be inspired by. So will every other candidate in this race. Here's my answer: 
 Who blinked?
1. Because of the corrupting influence of money in politics, Republicans can’t even admit climate change is real. 2. We cannot leave behind the folks who've spent their entire lives powering our nation. 
Make no mistake — every Democrat in this race thinks we need to take action on climate change, myself included. But there are two things no one else is talking about: 
Big Pharma spends millions to wield influence — but we can't let them escape responsibility for their actions. It's time to hold them accountable. All of them. 
The agency that protects our elections just broke. We can't afford this kind of dysfunction from Washington if we have any hope of defeating the foreign influence and Dark Money in our system. It's time for action — fast. 
America and its people are so much better than this President.
When hate knocked on Montana's door, we didn't equivocate.Every leader must send a clear message that white supremacy has no place in our country.  
There are 51 million kids in our public schools. Three million in charters, with mixed results. It’s time Betsy DeVos focuses on the 51, not the 3.

“Bullock can tout some genuine progressive accomplishments, including expanding Medicaid, freezing college tuition and limiting dark-money campaign contributions."
The biggest thing standing in the way of treating gun violence as a public health issue is the 
Some say Dark Money is a fringe issue. But if we want to make progress on climate — not to mention reduce gun violence, raise wages, and more — the fight against Big Money is the defining issue of our time.   I’ll make it the defining issue as President.  
 David, more than a good watch party.  A good crew working each and every day to talk to the good folks in Iowa!
 President Bullock would work to solve problems for all Americans.  He is out listening to folks all across the state of…
Trump has turned 'America First' into 'America Alone.' Period.

Donald Trump empowers white supremacy.The first thing we can do to counter its rise is to make him a one-term President. 
The spent $30 million to get Donald Trump elected. It’s not a gun safety organization. It’s a political organization seeking to tear us apart. 
My 11-year-old nephew Jeremy was shot and killed on his school playground. Like too many in El Paso, Dayton, and across the country — my family and I know the pain of gun violence. No one else should ever have to.  
 Thanks See you out there.
For too long, Washington has left too many folks behind. No more. Tune in to my  now, and join our fight to give every American a fair shot at a better life.
Trump has made allies of our enemies and enemies of our allies.Enough. 
See you at 6 pm ET,  😎 
I’m a progressive. Emphasis on *progress.*If we’re going to make real change for the folks Washington has left behind, we need a President who can get stuff done — without compromising on our values.
America deserves better than President Donald Trump — and we can beat him in 2020. But we’ve got to speak to the folks Washington has left behind, and tackle the concerns that keep them up at night. I’m sharing my plan to do it. Tune in to tonight for my 
November 3, 2020, is a referendum on that dream — and we need a candidate who will protect it, defend it, and extend it to the far too many folks who’ve never been able to access it.
Make no mistake, the American Dream isn’t dead. But it’s on life support, and we have to fight for it everyday.

We got Dark Money out of Montana’s elections. We can get it out of America’s.
 I know I couldn’t ask for anything more...thank you
We can build a country where everyone — no matter who they are or where they come from — gets a fair shot at a better life. But first, we have to rid our political system of the Big Money that corrupts it. Hear my plan to do it, tomorrow on Presidential Town Hall. 
I know we can win in the places we lost in 2016 — because I already have.
America is the most prosperous country on the planet. We can build an economy that works for working families — not just the wealthy and corporations. But to do it, we’ve got to rid our political system of Big Money.
Washington has left rural Americans behind for far too long. I’m damn tired of it. Every American deserves a fair shot at a better life — no matter where you live.
Grateful to be in the fight against Citizens United with Senator 
If we can make progressive change in a state like Montana, we can do it nationwide. Let us know why you’re on   
I'm running to talk to voters, not chase donors. 
When we have the political courage to stand up to the corporations and Dark Money flooding our political system — we will win.
Glad to have you on the team, 
This election can’t just be about getting 270 electoral votes — we’ve got to nominate someone who can actually bring folks together and govern again. I’m in this fight because I’ve done that before. And if we can do it in Montana, we can do it everywhere.
Looking forward to joining on at 2:30 ET! Tune in to hear about how we’re going to make government work again to ensure a fair shot for all Americans.
Ban superPACs.
Grateful to have folks like Jo Ann in this fight with me.  Let us know why you’re on   
We deserve a President who’s in this fight for working families — not their own bottom line.
When we dam the flood of Dark Money in our politics, we can end the corporate assault on workers and restore bargaining rights and empower unions again.
Trump is taxing working families to pay for an ego-driven trade war — driving our economy to the brink of recession. We have to do more than defeat him next November. We have to defeat the corrupt system that keeps people like him in power.
It still takes black women 20 months to earn what a white, non-Hispanic man makes in a year.  any longer for their fair share. They deserve equal pay, now. 
Today I'm reminded of Dorothy Bolden, a groundbreaking union leader. Ensuring fair wages was the fight of her life. 
There is no one that our President should fight for more than you. Not Big Money, not the Koch Brothers. Just you.
Our climate is in crisis. I see it in my backyard in Montana — and we're seeing it in the Amazon right now. The time for an immediate, durable solution was yesterday. We need action, now. 
 We had such a great time talking about the future of our country that we almost forgot to talk about you! 
Unions built the middle class in our country — and we’ve got to protect them with all we’ve got. 
My plan to do it: 
Washington is broken — and it’s going to stay that way until we get Dark Money out of our politics. 
Trump’s tax cuts were never for American families — they were for the corporations that paved his way to the White House. When I’m President, working families are going to have a louder voice than Big Money. 
Our country cannot go through another administration like this one.We have to do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We have to defeat the corrupt system that keeps people like him in power — and that starts with getting Big Money out of our politics.
Our next President should take on the Not Denmark.
Joining now on to talk about how we’re going to defeat Trump — and the corrupt system that keeps people like him in power. Tune in.
You shouldn’t be denied the choice to join a union if you drive Uber or deliver with Postmates. My plan:

Before I ever entered public service, I was a labor lawyer. I’ve carried stories like Dave’s, Jane’s, and Dennis’s with me ever since. 
Let’s get Dark Money out of our elections.
 I called from Montana, too.
I started my career as a labor lawyer. I fought alongside unions to protect the rights of workers — and the livelihoods of American families. We need more than just talk in the White House. We need action. 
I’m a progressive who’s won three elections in a red state — not by compromising our values, but by getting stuff done. I’m sitting down with the to talk about how we’re going to do the same thing nationwide. 
I’ve fought for workers and unions my entire career — and I’ll keep fighting for them in the White House. Grateful to speak with the Iowa Convention today about the work we have ahead of us.  
 “We kicked the Koch Brothers out of our elections in Montana so if it can happen in…
The President of the United States should stand for unions and working families — not corporations and the wealthy. 
Maybe President Trump would be more interested in helping rural America if we called it Greenland.
As President, I’ll ban employers’ use of AI to surveil employees.  This is one of the reasons why. 
We deserve a President who doesn’t have Wayne LaPierre on speed dial.
Union members deserve someone who works as hard as they do in the White House again. In a Bullock administration, they’ll have one. 
If we lose rural voters, we'll re-elect Trump. That's the reality. I've won three elections in a rural, red state. I know it can be done. But we've got to give folks a reason to vote for us — not just against him.
Nearly half of Americans wouldn't have $400 in their pocket to pay for an unexpected emergency. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's trade war-by-Twitter has added a $1,000 tax to every American family.That is not what American leadership looks like. 
As we said days ago... the answer to the question was always here:  
Winning the White House is essential. But we've got to win back state legislatures and invest in local races — and not just in blue states.I’m signing  because when we show up everywhere and talk with everyone, we win.
The majority of gun owners support background checks. The majority of Republicans support background checks. Yet this President refuses to stand up to the as they prepare to bankroll his campaign. 
In 2016 I was the only Democrat in the country to win statewide reelection in a place Trump won. We can’t write off parts of the country just because we didn’t do well there in past elections. If we do, we’ll lose. And we’ll deserve to.
If we don’t change our strategy — if we don’t give folks a reason to vote for us, not just against him — then Donald Trump will be spending another 4 years in the White House.  It's not going to be easy.   But here's the thing: I've seen it done before.
1. Interfere in and influence elections.2. Reap the rewards. 
Can't wait to see you tomorrow, Des Moines, join Sean and me to talk about the folks Washington has left behind and how we win in 2020:  
Public lands belong in public hands. Not sold to the highest bidder.

If we’re going to win back the places we lost, we  have to speak to the challenges folks face in their daily lives. That’s how I won 3 elections in Montana — not by compromising our values, but by getting stuff done. And if we can do it in Montana, we can do it nationwide.
The right to unionize and collectively bargain is part of the history of our country. We have to protect it.

That fight for action continued for years — and for people of color, it hasn't ended.I will never stop answering Rep. Rankin's call to protect our fighters in the struggle for democracy — no matter the gender you identify as, the color of your skin, or where you came from.
This is Jeannette Rankin. 4 years after she became our first female Congresswoman, she opened debate on the 19th Amendment with a call to action: "Shall our women, our home defense, be our only fighters in the struggle for democracy who shall be denied Federal action?" 
Let’s end the corrupting influence of Dark Money in our elections. Let’s ban the use of foreign money in elections.If we can do it in Montana, we can do it nationwide.

No one should struggle to pay for their healthcare plan.My plan to make sure they don’t: 
This is a cynical and calculated move by Trump to use American foreign policy to further his own political agenda. His recklessness has created an international incident that divides us and does nothing to make Americans more secure. 
If we don't beat Trump, it's more than just another 4 years on the line. Twitter feuds and special interests are part of a system that no longer represents the voice of rural America. Farming communities can't afford to wait. As President, I will lead from Day One with action.
Farm bankruptcies are up, profits are down, and Trump has shown little remorse or care. And if nothing changes, Iowans could face a new Farm Crisis that puts generations of family operations in jeopardy.
President Trump is knowingly doing this to Iowa farmers and producers -- and has once again proven that his White House is nothing but a safe haven for Big Oil interests.

We cannot just defeat Donald Trump. We have to defeat the corrupt system that keeps him in power — and allows billionaires to buy our elections. We are a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. I’m in this race to make sure we stay that way.
The fight against Big Money is the fight of our time — and it’s been the fight of my career. Billionaires should not be able to buy political influence in our democracy. My plan to make sure they can’t: 
A billionaire just spent $10 million to buy 130,000 donors. Here’s what I think of that. 
The Indian Child Welfare Act ensures Native children are able to stay in their communities and learn their culture with their families.Families belong together and I'll defend that right every day of my Presidency.
The protesters in Hong Kong are standing up for the basic rights they've long been promised. The world should stand up and condemn China's aggression, even if our President won't.I stand with the people of Hong Kong as they fight for their freedom.
The has created a situation in which billionaires can buy their way onto the debate stage. 
The gun lobby tried and failed to strike down Montana's campaign finance laws. If we can stop them in Montana, we can stop them everywhere.
Elections are about people talking to people. Not billionaires buying Facebook ads. 
Beating Trump is going to require more than incessant Facebook ads. We need to go everywhere and talk to everybody in order to win back the places Democrats lost. That’s exactly what I’ll do.
The DNC donor requirements created a situation in which billionaires can buy their way onto the debate stage, and campaigns are forced to spend millions on digital ads chasing one dollar donors — not talking directly to voters.
We’re kidding ourselves if we’re calling a $10 million purchase of 130,000 donors a demonstration of grassroots support.
The alternative to a Republican with endless Big Money at their disposal is not a Democrat with endless Big Money at their disposal. I’m talking to about why. Tune in.
Tom Steyer spent nearly $10 million to buy his way onto the debate stage. But no matter what the says, money doesn’t vote. People do.
 Coming up on  12ET: 
Big Pharma has no place in our political system. This is why.
Young people aging off of their parents’ healthcare plan are dying because they can’t afford the price of insulin. Yet Washington does nothing.
Not even because Donald Trump and his hate-fueled presidency is on the ballot.The American Dream is on the ballot. On Election Day, we have to protect it.
I know politicians always tell you that this election is the most important in your lifetime.  This one really is — and not because I’m on the ballot.
Our campaign has three rules: 1️⃣ We go everywhere. 2️⃣ We talk with everyone. 3️⃣ We fight for a fair shot for all — no matter who you are, where you’re from, or who you may have voted for in the past.
Washington has become a place where talking takes the place of doing — ; there's no greater symbol of that than the filibuster. I agree with ; call on other candidates to do the same. Partisan divides are not an excuse for progress to stop. 
Some of the candidates look at our healthcare system and see a tear-down. I see an add-on. No wrecking ball — just a repair job.We can’t  create uncertainty for the healthcare of 160 million Americans — and we should never do it for the sake of a political talking point.
Obamacare was the greatest expansion of healthcare since Medicare and Medicaid.We fought those attacks time and time again. But now it’s not just Republicans trying to repeal and replace Obamacare — it’s some Democrats, too.
40% of Americans wouldn’t have $400 in their pocket for an unexpected emergency. The economy has turned against them — and they’re the ones I’m fighting for.
We all have a responsibility to condemn white nationalism — whenever we see it.  This is about the country we pass down to our kids. We deserve better than a President who sees “good people on both sides” — and together, we can do something about it.
Just last week, we saw 22 more in El Paso.  White nationalism is ugly. It’s fueled by hatred, and it’s un-American. That’s why we must confront it head-on.
Two years ago today, Heather Heyer became a casualty of white nationalism in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
Team Bullock does right, fears nothing, and is ready to fight for the country we all deserve.Grateful to have these folks in my corner.  
Last week I lowered the flags after a man motivated only by hate ended the lives of 22 people in El Paso.   It was the 9th time the flags were lowered for a mass shooting since Las Vegas. Enough. 
The American Dream isn’t dead. But we have to be honest — it’s on life support. We revive it when we make Donald Trump a one-term President, and make sure no one is forgotten.
When I was a kid, 90 percent of Americans knew their kids would do better than they did. Today, it’s less than half.  Sixty percent of Americans have not had a pay increase in real terms in 40 years.  Our economy has a problem — and Washington is leaving folks behind.
The American Dream is not a myth — it is, as Dr. King famously taught us, a promissory note.  For far too many Americans, that promissory note has been nothing more than a bounced check.
America’s diversity will always be our strength — and we should celebrate it at every opportunity. Eid Mubarak to all those celebrating  today.
Bumping into your second cousins at the State Fair? Just another day in Iowa. 
To beat Donald Trump, we need real solutions that can solve the problems folks face today. We don’t need more wishlist economics and promises of a revolution. 
White supremacists think the man in the Oval Office has their backs. That should not be a sentence uttered in America.
I am running for President because I refuse to cede the votes of rural Americans to Donald Trump. The women and men who work the land, feed the world, and pass the plate on Sunday are not forever wedded to a lying New York con man with orange hair and a gold toilet.

I am a hunter and a gun owner.  No real hunter needs a 30-round magazine.  No real hunter needs a weapon of war.  No real hunter needs a bump-stock.  And no real hunter wants a terrorist or a domestic abuser to get their hands on a weapon. 
I’m speaking at  because gun violence is a public health crisis in our country — and it’s time we address it.
Partisan divides are not an excuse for progress to stop. Trust me. 
We’re going to win back the White House by winning back the places we lost and bringing back the folks Washington left behind — and we’re going to do it together. ⁣⁣Thanks to everyone who came out to the  Dinner tonight! 
Nobody should have to leave their home, family, or their community to find opportunity. It’s time to make that promise a reality. We need to expand rural broadband so everyone has access to opportunity. As President, I’ll do it in 3 years.
Cam is fitting in just fine with the  folks in Iowa! 
American families are suffering from Donald Trump’s Trade War — and they’re going to remember it at the ballot box.
Our farmers don’t need Trump’s false promises or self-aggrandizing tweets.They need trade — not aid. 
 is READY for tonight’s Wing Ding Dinner! 
5 years ago, a white police officer in Ferguson shot Michael Brown — an unarmed, black teenager. We can’t bring Michael back to his family. But we can work to realize a future where no parent fears for their child’s safety because of the color of their skin — and we will.
Our farmers aren’t interested in this President’s attempt to play politics with their livelihoods. They need 
For more on my plan to expand and improve infrastructure in rural America: 
As President, I’ll fully connect rural America to broadband services in three years. Yep, that’s right. Three years.
Trump tweets ➡️ Farmers lose profits ➡️  America suffers. We need a real trade policy — not negotiations by tweet. 
I’m a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who won three elections in a red state — not by compromising our values — but by fighting like hell to deliver results. It’s the same way we’re going to win back the White House. 
We can take smart, aggressive steps to tackle climate change today.  And we don’t have time to wait.

I’m here at the Iowa State Fair because I know we have to win back the places we lost, get our country back on track, and beat Donald Trump.But there’s work to do.LIVE from the Political Soapbox:
Started our day at the Iowa State Fair right — follow along! 
Our President’s comments and policies have been racist. But if that’s all we talk about until November 3, 2020, we’ll lose this election. 
40% of Americans don’t have $400 for an unexpected emergency. Trump’s economy was never working for them. It works for the wealthy and corporations — and it’s by design.
Everyone wants their community to be safe. It's Dark Money, the NRA and political inaction that's holding us back. 
Trump’s trade wars are destroying farmers’ livelihoods. There’s just no other way to put it. 
I've been asked to lower the flags:Nine times since the Las Vegas shooting.Seven times since Parkland.I have hope that this is the time Washington wakes up. We must be relentless. We must take action. 
We can win this election.But we have to step back and start focusing on the problems folks face in their everyday lives — or we'll hand the presidency to Donald Trump on a silver platter. 
Like 40% of Americans, I'm a gun owner. I hunt. So to my fellow gun owners, I say we have to stop listening to the and start listening to our kids. 
Gun violence is a public health crisis — and we've got to face it head on. See you Saturday, and 
As President, I'll take the same approach to getting things done.If we can expand healthcare to 100k Montanans and kick the Koch Brothers out of our state's elections, we can do it across the country.When we marry principle and pragmatism, we can solve our biggest challenges.
As Governor, even with a GOP majority legislature, I took on the problems Washington can't even begin to solve: from keeping college affordable to kicking Big Money out of our elections.
In this big, beautiful, multicultural, multilingual, multifaceted democracy, two questions — will we solve it and can we get it done — come together.  When we focus on those questions, unite the country, and move solutions forward, you’ll be surprised what we can do.
The way I have won — and what we need to do now — is to make sure voters know that we hear them,  understand their problems, and have solutions that we can deliver today. People have been let down by this President enough. We’ve got to deliver for them.
The President of the United States is a racist — and we’ve got to condemn it at every turn. But if he’s all we talk about, we’re going to lose this election.
 Today, I ask you to remember our ultimate goal: to beat Donald Trump. We need 270 votes and to win back the places we lost last time around.  It’s a challenge I know I can win.
 I’m speaking to today because there’s nothing I want more than for Donald Trump’s presidency to end. But as I stood on the debate stage last week, I saw his re-election become more likely with every passing minute.
 I come from a state where a lot of folks voted for Donald Trump. I know how hard he’ll be to beat.  So let me put it plainly: we cannot defeat Donald Trump’s politics of personal destruction if we practice the politics of self-destruction.
We are at a tipping point in our nation’s history.  But if we go everywhere, bring back the folks Washington left behind, and win back the places we lost — we can get our country back on track.  Today, at 
Strong unions make a strong country. Grateful to speak with and President Lee Saunders about the work they’re doing to strengthen unions — and working families — in Nevada and across America.

Now more than ever, we need a President able to get stuff done. 
In difficult times, America deserves a leader who can get stuff done. I'll be talking about this on with at 7:35 pm ET — tune in.
A farmer in Rippey, Iowa, told me that when Trump tweets, he loses hundreds of thousands of dollars. He deserves more than a bailout — he deserves a President that works for him and his family. 
As we still reckon with words of hate, we remember her conviction that language may be the measure of our lives. That it protects and gives voice. And that there is little we cannot do, when we do it together.
Toni Morrison fearlessly told the stories of African American communities and helped to rewrite our nation's narrative.
You've hurt their markets, their profits, and their lives. Their hurt is on you, 
Our family, like far too many in this country, has been personally impacted by gun violence.Washington’s inaction in the face of gun violence is inexcusable. We must take action.

As I say to my kids: every time you point your finger, recognize three of your fingers are pointing back at you. 
More than a year ago, I asked Donald Trump what he's doing to end the gun violence epidemic in our country. His answer wasn't good enough then — and his leadership isn't good enough now. 
We cannot confront this epidemic of gun violence with empty words.We are El Paso.We are Dayton.We are Americans.It’s time for action.
The El Paso shooting was an act of domestic terrorism. Addressing the rising tide of hate in this country means condemning white nationalism when we see it — and what happened on Saturday in El Paso is no exception.
Not even 24 hours after El Paso, we wake up to more bloodshed in Dayton. I’m heartbroken for both communities — and for our country. The complexity of the problems underlying this gun violence epidemic cannot serve as the excuse for inaction.
That’s why the next President has to:  🏳️‍🌈 Make passing the Equality Act a top priority  🏳️‍🌈 Reverse Trump’s discriminatory policies 🏳️‍🌈 Nominate justices who will uphold those values
If you can be married on a Sunday and fired for it on a Monday, we still have work to do.

I met a teacher in Iowa who paid $600 a month for insulin. A third of her salary.No teacher should have to take a second job to afford insulin. When I’m President, they won’t.
I’m devastated for El Paso and the families whose lives were forever changed today. But it’s not enough for our hearts to go out to them — our laws fail them and their families. No more. We need action, and we need it now.
We fight for a fair shot for everyone — no matter where they live, how they got there, or who they voted for in the past. 
I’m speaking to the 2020 Forum about my career serving our union workers – and how I’m going to do it as President. Tune in! 
It was a good week. 
Here’s my stance:It. Should. Be. Her.Decision.
These folks know we can make Donald Trump a one-term President by sharing our message with neighbors, organizing our communities, and knocking on doors — join us at 
Huge thanks to the for inviting me today to talk about how we win back the places we lost. 
Grateful to talk about issues facing new Americans with today. Her work fighting for families is inspiring — and her fearless determination to fix our immigration system is what we need nationwide. 
Farmers are hurting because of Trump's trade war. Don't take it from me, take it from farmers.
It’s never been more important to fight alongside our union leaders for pay equity, fair wages, ; respect for all. Grateful to for hosting us to talk about my plan to fight for workers. I've fought for unions my whole life, and I'll be your voice in the White House. 
Great start on my first visit in Nevada. Talking with folks about building a strong economy, affordable healthcare, and a good public education for our kids — the bread and butter of what makes people’s lives better. 
When we do that we can finally tackle the challenges that Washington has failed to address for far too long. We can ensure every American has a fair shot at success.
On Day One, I’ll sign an executive order that cracks down on Dark Money, and confront the toxic influence of money in politics.
I’m on with to talk about the folks Washington DC has left behind. Tune in at 2:30 pm ET.
Grateful to have the support of these incredible leaders in Iowa. 
There is too much power in too few hands with too little oversight. As President, I’m going to change that.
Amazon controls nearly half of internet sales, but paid $0 in taxes. Half of Google’s employees are independent contractors. New businesses can’t even get funded if they take on giants like Facebook.
It used to be Republicans who wanted to repeal and replace Obamacare — now, it’s even some Democrats. We’ve got to build on the success of Obamacare, not dismantle it. Here’s how we do it: 
Washington prioritizes Big Money and special interests over people.  When I’m President, that stops.
Wins this week:✅ Presidential debate✅ Lawsuit against Trump ✅ Skeeball 
 is exactly right. Trump’s Trade War is hurting American farmers more than it hurts China, and it has to stop.
I'm a pro-choice, pro-Union, populist Democrat — and I'm here to make Donald Trump a one-term President. 
Every time Trump tweets, farmers get hurt. 
We can do something about Dark Money's toxic influence on our politics — and we can do it today.Exhibit A:
Trump's Senior Campaign Advisor from 2016 said "Bullock frightens me." When we talk about issues that matter to American's everyday lives, we win — and Donald Trump knows it. Game on. 
I won three times in a red state, and never once compromised on:  ✅ Workers’ rights ✅ Civil rights ✅ Women’s rights We can win back the places we lost AND get progressive things done. 
It’s about working families from coast to coast, hoping to give their kids a fair shot at a better future. I walked off that stage on Tuesday feeling grateful, inspired, and ready to keep fighting for the hardworking folks I meet everyday. Let’s get back to work.
It’s about the farmers in Iowa who told me that every time the President tweets, they lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. It’s about the parents struggling with the choice of putting food on the table or paying for an unexpected emergency.
The debates are over and I want to say thank you to all of the folks who joined our campaign since Tuesday evening. But I want to make one thing clear: this election isn’t just about the folks following the  hashtag.
No moderator asked how any candidate will fight the attacks on a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions.As Governor of a state with a Republican legislature, I’ve stopped every attack on these rights.  I’m ready to bring that fight to Washington. 
It's a big win for *our democracy* 
You could say I had a great night! Chip in today to make sure there are many great debate nights to come:  
 I was hoping to hear you express your love for day old pizza, because you were enjoying connecting with voters so much you forgot to go home for the night!
Change starts with showing up.I'm so grateful for David and the folks in Rippey for welcoming me to their community — and for fighting for their family's future in rural Iowa. 
"Bullock represents an almost forgotten tradition that scrambles the divisions that have come to define our times" 
Apropos of nothing, text FAIRSHOT to 30411. 
Yesterday, we took our fight for a fair shot to the  stage. Today, we had our best day of fundraising since we launched this campaign. Now, I think it’s time for a beer. 
We cannot let this campaign — or this debate — become detached from folks’ everyday lives. 
I got into this race two months ago. I’ve been to Iowa seven times since, and held more than 30 public town halls. Not one person has shown up ; asked me about Mueller’s investigation. 
The Iran Deal was working. Withdrawing from it emboldened Iran to create a nuclear weapon — and we got literally nothing in return. 
It’s past time to bring the war in Afghanistan to a responsible end. Yet this administration doesn’t have a plan — and is ripping up the alliances that have kept us safe for generations. I will bring our soldiers home and rebuild our alliances abroad. 
Donald Trump’s sledge-hammer approach to trade isn’t working — and it’s American families like the folks I met in Rippey who are left paying the bill.  
We just had our best fundraising day since we launched. That’s INCREDIBLE — and it’s all thanks to you.Help keep us on the debate stage this fall — chip in today:  
It is an outrage that any community in America lacks access to clean drinking water. We need a government that can get stuff done — not just talk.  
When government can barely function and politics are treated like a game, communities of color are the ones who get hurt.  
Some say this is a fringe issue. But for progressives who want to make progress on climate — not to mention reduce gun violence, raise wages, ; more — the fight against Big Money is the defining issue of our time.   I’ll make it the defining issue of my presidency. 
Thanks to the Koch Brothers, Republicans are the only major party in the world that denies climate change.  But for some reason, no one on this stage is talking about the corrupting influence of money in politics. 
"On a night that crystallized the policy differences between the left and center, Bullock spoke with credibility as the only presidential candidate to have won in a state that Donald Trump carried by 20-points." 
As President, I’ll secure our borders. I’ll end family separation once and for all.I’ll protect our  and ensure a pathway to citizenship.  
Going on at 9pm ET to talk about keeping the  focused on people's everyday lives. Tune in — it's not like anything else is on.😏
We spent decades trying to pass Obamacare — we’ve got to expand and extend it, not take it away from the families it serves. 
There’s a lot of talk on this stage about beating Donald Trump — and I couldn’t agree more.But let’s be clear: there is only one person in this race who’s ever won a state Trump won.  
Help us keep rolling: 
BIG NEWS: Our campaign had the best fundraising day since we launched today — and it’s all thanks to you.
The biggest problem with our immigration system is Donald J. Trump.  
On the  stage, I showed how we can deliver a fair shot for everyone — and do it right now. The best part? We're just getting started. Join us:  
Some folks on this stage think there's nothing we can do to get Dark Money out of our elections today.They're wrong. 
Every woman — in every zipcode — should have the right to make her own healthcare decisions. Thank you, for the work you and members do to fight for families! 
Our plan to fight climate change can't just be written for the sake of a press release. We need to take immediate and durable action that will get done now. Like this:  
 Thanks Pam! Appreciate your support.
 Thanks for your support, Kate!
We'll need more than just Wishlist Economics to beat Donald Trump. We need practical solutions that connect with people's everyday lives and win back the places we lost. 
"Bullock, the governor who won reelection in Montana on the same night Trump took the state in a landslide, projected a confident folksy optimism even as he underscored his opposition to what he called Warren and Sanders’ 'wish list economics.'"
Scoot on over to  to make sure I’m in the next debate!
Rolling out of the  like 
This election isn’t a choice between the left and the center. It’s not a choice between wishlists or sacrificing our values in order to win. It’s about giving people a fair shot and making sure we don’t forget the people Washington has left behind. 
At the  I talked about how we can win back the places we lost and beat Donald Trump at the ballot box. Just before I got on stage, I beat him in the courthouse, too.

Trump has turned ‘America First’ into ‘America Alone.’

We have to do more to guarantee a fair shot for everyone. Things like: 📍 Free 2 year college.📍 Expanded apprenticeship opportunities. 📍 Federal student aid for their certificate programs.That’s how we get things done for folks Washington has left behind. 
I paid off $175k in student loans in today’s dollars. So I know firsthand: we have to do more to make college affordable.But a majority of American adults don’t even have a college degree. The debate over free college is just another example of “Wishlist Economics.” 
When a farmer in Rippey, IA tells me that every time tweets they lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, his trade war isn’t working.  
 I am proud of my friend for continuing to fight against the corrupting influence of dark money in campaigns…
Thanks for watching, everybody. If you’re ready to make the kind of real, progressive change that matters to American families, chip in $1 now:   
The American people deserve more than plans written for the sake of a press release. This is not a false choice: we can save our climate and give every American a fair shot. But to do it, we have to lead with real, practical solutions. Not wishlists.  
As Democrats, let’s not demonize them. Let’s bring them with us as we transition to a clean energy economy. 
We need to take immediate action on climate change — but this cannot be yet another conversation disconnected from people’s lives. We cannot forget the union workers and communities who have been powering our country for generations.  
Everyone on this stage believes we need bold action on climate change. But we have to realize Republicans won’t even acknowledge it exists, because of the corrupting influence of Dark Money.We need to end money’s grip on our politics. Yesterday.

Even with a ⅔ Republican legislature, I passed the most progressive anti-Dark Money laws in the country. Divided government is not an excuse for progress to stop.  
This isn’t just a choice between the left and the center. It’s making a choice to fight for a fair shot for everyone.  
I’m a progressive.I won a Republican state three separate times. Trust me. We can have both. 
As Governor, I did something. Now Montana has one of the strongest campaign finance laws in the country. Donald Trump said he would drain the swamp, but it’s just gotten swampier. We need a President who is getting Washington back to work. 
After Citizens United allowed unlimited corporate spending in our elections, most Democrats in Washington did nothing.  They spoke about it.  They raised money off it.  Nothing actually got done. 
My 11-year-old nephew Jeremy was shot and killed on his school playground. Like too many in Gilroy, Parkland, and across the country — my family and I know the pain of gun violence. No one else should ever have to.  
If we can kick the Koch Brothers out of Montana, we can do it everywhere. 
A sane immigration system needs a sane leader.  
Donald Trump isn’t just using our immigration to tear families apart — he’s using it to tear our country apart. We are a country of immigrants. Americans won’t forget that. 
Let’s be clear about what some folks on this stage want. Not only are the Republicans trying to repeal and replace Obamacare, so are they. True progressives build on progress. I’d build on Obamacare, not tear it down.  
I’m a Progressive — emphasis on progress. I’m running for President to get stuff done for all those Americans Washington has left behind.  
  comes out quick and proudly declares himself pro-choice first thing! 👏👏👏  
I’d expand and extend Obamacare, with a public option to buy into Medicare. I’d give the government the ability to negotiate drug prices and end surprise medical billing once and for all. That’s how we can make healthcare accessible and affordable for all Americans. 
It took decades of work to pass Obamacare. Now it’s not just Republicans who want to repeal and replace Obamacare – some Democrats on this stage do, too. I’m not going to support a plan that disrupts quality healthcare coverage from families who already have it. 
Folks on this stage are campaigning on “Wishlist Economics” — and there’s no truer example than Medicare for All.  
My 12 year old son Cam had a heart attack the day he was born. He was put in a helicopter and rushed to the hospital in Salt Lake City. They read him his last rites. Because we had insurance, he’s here with me tonight.  
The farmers getting hit by Trump’s Trade War and the teacher who works a second job just to afford insulin can’t wait for a revolution.Their problems are in the here and now — and they deserve solutions that can actually get done. 
Watching the last debate, the other candidates seemed more concerned with scoring points and outdoing each other with “Wishlist Economics” than making sure Americans know we hear their voices. I’m here tonight to share my vision to help their lives. 
I’m Steve Bullock. I’m a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who’s won three elections in a red state. I didn’t do it by compromising our values. I did it by getting stuff done. 
Nothing like taking the  stage having just beaten in court. Let's do this. 
They watch Washington leave behind their families and communities — election after election. They deserve a fair shot at a better future. That’s what we’re fighting for in this race and at tonight’s  I’ll see you there.
They watch their parents choose between putting food on the table or dealing with a healthcare bill.They watch their teachers struggle to make ends meet despite working a noble profession. They watch the President normalize language we hoped they would never know. 
In 2013, I said that our kids are watching our words and our deeds — and it’s up to us to decide the kind of country they will inherit.It’s never been more true. 
If you’re ready to make the kind of real, progressive change that actually matters to people’s lives, chip in $1 before tonight’s  
I’m on the debate stage in spite of, not because of, corporate PACs and Big Money interests. I’m here because of you. 
Washington is leaving communities like Warren behind. If we’re going to beat Donald Trump, it’s up to us to show up, listen, and provide the vision that wins them back.
 Wishing my friend  good luck at tonight’s debate! 🤙🏻 
My family is the best. Let’s do this.  
So grateful to have one of my biggest supporters in the  audience tonight — my son Cam! 
Trump promised to save American manufacturing. In two days, hundreds of folks in Warren, Michigan will lose their  jobs because when the GM transmission plant closes down. 
We deserve better than Citizens United and the corrupt system it enshrines. It has to go.
Those stories — those people — got me into this work. And this campaign is about fighting for them.
I started my career as a union-side labor lawyer. At night, I'd tell my kids bedtime stories of the brave men and women who were fighting for justice and a fair shot at a better life.
Ryan Reynolds will not be playing me in a biopic. I accept this.Thanks for the questions,
I believe in a country where every one of us gets a fair shot at a better life. That’s what I’ve fought for as a Governor.That’s what I’ll fight for as President. 
It’s about the teacher spending ⅓ of her salary on life-saving insulin every month. And it’s about you — the problems you’re staring in the face, and how we’re going to solve them. Now.
This election is about more than just Donald Trump. It’s about the sixth generation farmer who told me he wasn’t sure if his son should be the seventh. 
We need a progressive in the White House. We need to beat Donald Trump.We can do both. Tonight at the  I’ll tell you how. 
We need to beat Trump. We can't let anything stand in our way. 
My secret to getting progressive things done in a red state? (are you ready?)LISTEN TO PEOPLE.
If we don’t win back the places we lost, we won’t beat Donald Trump. It’s that simple. 
I am the only Democratic candidate who has won a Trump state. On the debate stage tomorrow, I’m going to share how I did it — and how we can beat him in 2020. 
4 in 5 Americans don’t carry a dime in college-related debt. They deserve ideas that work — not big promises that look good in a tweet, but fail to deliver real change. 
Happy 15th Birthday Alex! I love going undercover and hitting the town with you as much today as I did when you were 10! 
Divided government is not an excuse for progress to stop. If we’re going to build the country our kids deserve to inherit, we need a candidate who knows how to win — and knows how to govern.
I governed with a nearly 60% Republican legislature. That didn’t stop us from getting progressive things done: expanding Medicaid to nearly 100,000 people, freezing college tuition, and getting Dark Money out of our state’s elections.
This election is about more than 270 electoral votes. Once we win back the White House, we need a President who can get things done.
I can’t do this alone. You, me, and are going to take our democracy back.
Taking on the corrupting influence of dark money is the fight of our time — and it’s been the fight my career. I’m honored to be named a  candidate by 
Together, we can do it. Join us: 
I’m in this race because we must do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat the corrupt system that keeps people like him in power.
We cannot continue to confront gun violence with empty words. No one should fear for their family’s safety when they go to a festival, to school, or to a movie. Enough.
Washington is broken. Getting Big Money out of politics is how we fix it.
How Washington works: 1️⃣ Hundreds of millions in Big Money is spent influencing our elections.2️⃣ Many of the elected leaders act in the interests of Big Money instead of the Americans they serve.3️⃣ Our country ; our elections become less safe. 
Big Oil. Big Pharma. Big Money. Until the only Big thing in our politics are our ideas, special interests will continue to hold us back from making progress.
Good. Now let's get Big Pharma and its Dark Money out of our politics, and create a healthcare system that doesn't put a family like Sov's in this position in the first place. 
EXCLUSIVE DETAILS ON MY DEBATE STRATEGY: I’m going to talk about the problems folks face every day and how to solve them now. 
A three year old is not a security risk. We need to get our priorities straight. 
We fought hard, campaigned everywhere, and spoke with everyone — no matter who they may have voted for in the past. And we won. If we can do it in Montana, we can do it everywhere.
We got progressive stuff done, even with a Republican legislature:📍 Protected the rights of LGBTQ+ employees in the workplace📍 Expanded Medicaid to 100,000 Montanans📍 Stopped every single attack on a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions
I was the only Democrat in the country to be re-elected statewide in 2016. Donald Trump took Montana by 20 points. I won by 4.
We can’t hide from climate change. We have to face this crisis — and the Big Money profiting from Washington’s inaction — head on.
I am in awe of the strength of the 148 American patriots who co-signed this op-ed, calling for resolute unity in the face of a President using racism to divide us. You are what makes this country great. 
"Mr. Bullock has a talent for knowing how to talk Republicans into doing Democratic things (including voting for him)." 
The promise of a high quality life in America shouldn’t end when you turn 65. 
In 2015, I went to a town called Choteau to campaign for Medicaid expansion.A Democrat hadn’t won that county in years. But if we were going to secure healthcare for 100,000 Montanans, we had to go everywhere and talk to everyone.I’ll never forget that visit. 
Our Secretary of Education cares more about serving her bottom line than serving our children. 
This is true: Washington hasn’t passed a budget in 22 years. If I did that even once as a Governor, I’d be out of a job. Washington needs a change — and on Election Day, we are going to deliver it.
Nearly two in three American adults don't have a college degree. What is the next President going to do for their futures?
As Governor, I fought for folks with disabilities to receive equal wages and work without discrimination — but we have a long way to go. On the anniversary of the ADA, we must all recommit to ensuring a fair shot for every American. As President, that's exactly what I'll do.
1 in 5 folks in this country have a disability.29 years ago today, the ADA began to tear down the walls preventing them from the fair shot they deserve.
The lies. The bragging. We expect more out of our kindergarteners than this.
“Bullock has been combating dark money since his years as Montana’s Attorney General when he led the charge in challenging the controversial case Citizens United v. FEC.” 
We have to take immediate action on climate. That’s not up for debate.But we won’t get anywhere while Big Money and special interests control our political system. We’ve got to eliminate the toxic influence of money in our politics — before it’s too late.
No one should have to face a half-million dollar bill for getting life-saving care.Our healthcare system is broken. But when we take Big Pharma and special interests out of the equation, we can make it work for everyone.
Chanda spent her childhood fleeing torture ; certain death.She spent 25 years in refugee camps.Now, she’s building a new life with her family and working hard.Diversity makes us strong, and I will never stop fighting for those who embody the best of our American values. 
So I know firsthand: while promises of free college and total loan forgiveness make for flashy press releases, they aren’t serious solutions for most people’s daily lives. 
The student debt crisis is personal to me. I graduated from law school with over $175,000 of debt in today’s dollars — and I’ll never forget the day we paid it off.
I’m a pro-choice, pro-union Democrat who won three elections in a red state.  I didn’t do it by compromising our progressive values. I did it by getting stuff done.
Until we rid Big Money from our political system, everything else will stay broken. But we can do it. I know because I’ve done it before. 
We’re going to go everywhere. Listen more than we talk. Bring back the folks who feel left behind. Then, we’re going to win. 
...of course he did.

 No matter what's tweeted today, let's not forget: because of Robert Mueller's investigation, 6 Trump campaign advisers…
“So when Governor Bullock campaigns across the country talking about his plan to beat Big Money for good, I know he will make it happen.”
The Special Counsel’s investigation directly led to the guilty plea deals or indictments of six close aides to the President. The American people are ready for an Administration that focuses on making people’s lives better, not avoiding criminal prosecution.
At every opportunity to cooperate with this investigation and give the American people clarity on what happened in the 2016 election, the Trump Administration chose instead to impede its progress and attack its legitimacy.
A farmer in Rippey, IA told me, “When the President tweets, it costs us hundreds of thousands of dollars.”Farmers are hurting, and this President is at fault. 
Instagram vs. reality (Family lake days are no joke.) 
We won't solve climate change by hiding from it.
No matter what's tweeted today, let's not forget: because of Robert Mueller's investigation, 6 Trump campaign advisers have been charged or pleaded guilty.Make sure that's not forgotten with a limited edition shirt:

Let’s be honest: too much of the discussion on the last debate stage was disconnected from folks’ everyday lives. Next week, I’m going to change that. 
Donald Trump is the biggest threat to our democracy in modern history. We have to go everywhere, talk to everyone, and do everything to make him a one-term President
The path to victory in 2020 isn’t just through the coasts. It includes places we lost in 2016 — and as the only Democrat in the race who won a  state Trump won, I know this firsthand. 
Talking has replaced doing for far too long in Washington. So here’s my promise to you: I’ll focus on making government work again so we can finally get things done. 
 "I have the right to do whatever I want as president."Narrator: He did not in fact have that right.

We're leading on women's pay because I believe in a fair shot for all. As candidates, we have the opportunity to put our ideals into action — we should seize it.

Seriously, she has ten yachts.

If we can do all of that in Montana, we can do it across the country — and that’s the perspective we need in this race.
My legislature is more Republican than Congress. But that didn’t stop me from: ✅ Protecting healthcare for 1 in 10 Montanans✅ Freezing college tuition ✅ Kicking the Koch Brothers out of Montana’s elections. 
Our public lands belong in public hands. We deserve a President who will fight to make sure they stay that way.

President Reagan said “America is a shining city upon a hill whose beacon light guides freedom-loving people everywhere.”President Trump is extinguishing that light.
We’ll never have a strong economy if it doesn’t work for all Americans.
Our economy may look good to the corporations profiting off of Trump’s handouts  — but working families still struggle to find a good-paying job, pay off loans, and provide their children a better future.
Even with a 2/3 Republican legislature, I kept fighting to expand Medicaid to 100,000 people. This is why. 
When we focus on solving the problems that working families face every day, we will make Donald Trump a one-term President.  
Families are working harder, and making less. Folks are choosing between life-saving medication and paying rent.Two thirds of communities in the country have lost businesses over the last 10 years.

Took a quick break from the campaign trail to visit Lowell, Iowa: the place my family found opportunity. It was pretty special.

Our public lands should be a rallying cry to save our environment. Not a means to destroy it.

Small towns and rural communities aren't just a soundbite — it's the way 20% of us live. We cannot forget rural America. As President, I won't.

It’s official — I’m taking the debate stage on July 30 to share my plan to ensure a fair shot for all and that no American is forgotten.Let’s keep the momentum going: 
It’s an honor to be nominated. 
I know most working folks won't have the time to watch this video. But this story is about saving lives and entire communities.It’s an example of how government ought to work. 
Corporations just spent $1 trillion on stock buy backs.The wealthiest got billions in handouts from Trump ; the GOP.So, no more excuses.It's time that everyone gets a fair shot at a better life. 
$22.5 trillion is the definition of “a huge problem.” What ever happened to the supposed party of fiscal restraint?
If we stay focused and tackle the issues that matter to working families, we’re going to win exactly where won.
A living, dignified wage is the first step to a fair shot. Let's get this done and  
Burying your head in the sand won’t solve the problem. It’s time we act on climate change now. 
I’m going to spend every day of this campaign working to ensure every family gets a fair shot at a better life, because that was always the promise of America. This administration isn’t delivering it. Working together, we will.
Most Americans haven’t seen a pay increase in 40 years in real terms — yet President Trump gave giant tax handouts to corporations and his biggest donors. DC is swampier now than it ever has been. But it doesn’t have to be.
Trump’s Interior Secretary said he's not losing sleep over climate change. As the father of three kids and Governor of a state that has dealt with record wildfires, I am.

If we're going to win in 2020, we've got to win back the places we lost. If we’re going to move our nation forward, nobody should feel forgotten. Join the fight:  
This race is about one thing: how to make sure working families have a fair shot again. This administration isn't doing it — but working together, we will. 
Now that it’s official, my team is… really excited for me to take the debate stage.Chip in if you’re excited too:  
I can't wait for the debate. Together, we’ll finally ensure every American gets a fair shot at success.
At the debate later this month, I'll be focused on fighting corruption in Washington, securing healthcare instead of dismantling the entire system, and breaking the logjam that's plagued our politics for far too long.
We can’t let this debate become disconnected from folks' everyday lives. This can’t be about bickering or grandstanding — we've got to share our solutions to the problems working families face every day.
You did it! We just locked in our space on the debate stage, and it wouldn’t have happened without you. From all of us at  thank you.

Seeking asylum is not illegal. Period. 
We don’t have many sure things in life. But when I’m President, we’ll have one: public lands will stay in public hands.
When we replace anger with civility and division with compassion, we will make Donald Trump a one-term President. Help us make it happen:  
Our public lands are one of our great equalizers. They belong to you and me — and we have to make sure they stay that way.
What this company just did is inspirational, but it should never come to this. Every woman deserves equal pay for equal work.
“His record fighting what is derided as dark money — the unlimited money flowing from undisclosed donors to try to influence elections — in Montana was so influential that it was featured in a movie, aptly titled 'Dark Money.'"

We could learn a thing or two from the empathy and compassion of our kids.
Your healthcare should be more important than the egos of Republican leaders. 
Our progress on these issues requires us to eliminate the Big Money corrupting Washington DC.
We face some of the biggest challenges of our time: a humanitarian crisis at our border, climate change, the toxic influence of dark money in politics, to name a few. 
Diversity is our strength.
It’s no wonder folks are angry. But instead of doing something about it, Donald Trump is pouring gasoline on that fire. He’s further damaging our economy, our communities, and our country — but we won’t let him succeed.
If you’re reading this, you’re probably working harder and making less. Real wages are lower today than they were 40 years ago. And we’ve got a President who’d rather give tax handouts to the wealthy than support working families.
In the most prosperous country in the world, it is unacceptable that insulin costs 346% more than it does in Canada.
While Donald Trump gives a massive tax cut to the wealthy, the average American hasn’t had a raise in real wages in 40 years. Working families deserve to be our first priority again. 
He's used racist rhetoric like this before. Left unchecked, he will do it again.We need to do everything we can to make sure he’s a one-term President. 
Never underestimate the impact one judge can have on OUR Supreme Court.

Inspired by the young folks at taking action on our climate crisis this weekend in Miami. This is one of the biggest challenges of our time, and we need all hands on deck to tackle it.
Grateful for the opportunity to listen to farmers in Rippey this week about what they’re going through, and how we can ensure this economy works for everyone.
The folks in our small towns and rural communities are suffering under Trump’s Trade Wars — and they’ve been ignored for far too long. 
We deserve better than Citizens United. 
We’ve got to keep all of our options on the table. Here’s why:  
We cannot allow this President to divide us. 
Washington has become a place where talking has replaced doing. And let me tell you: that doesn’t fly with me. We need leaders ready to get stuff done. 
With these rights under attack across the country, we all have a responsibility to speak up and fight back. Every woman deserves the right to make her own healthcare decisions. Period.
Republican leaders are waging a war on women, and I don’t say that lightly. As Governor, I protected a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions every time it was threatened.
President Trump spoke for nearly an hour on his “environmental leadership” this week — and didn’t mention the phrase “climate change” once. Pretending to care doesn’t cut it.
We live in one of the most prosperous nations in the world -- failing to pay our educators a living wage is unacceptable. No teacher should have to take a second or third job to make ends meet.
Our teachers do one of our most sacred jobs: helping our kids meet their highest potential, and in doing so create a better country to pass down to our next generation.
I consider myself lucky to be a public school graduate. I wouldn't be running for President today without the teachers who guided me back at Helena High — that's why I'm sending my kids to the same schools that I graduated from.
To win back the places we lost, we must have the backs of candidates up and down the ballot. I’m inspired and thankful for the work is doing to lift up leaders at every level. 
For folks in the path of Tropical Storm Barry, please heed safety warnings from and state and local officials. I'm thankful to the first responders and others across the Gulf helping their families and neighbors. My family and I are with you all.

If we can’t win back places that we lost and give people a reason to vote for us, not just against him, Donald Trump will win again.
One third of Iowa counties went Obama in ‘08 and Obama in ‘12 — and then along came Trump in ‘16.

This is how DC works now — but it doesn’t have to. My plan to fight Big Money in our politics: 
➡️ Spend millions of dollars of Dark Money buying an election.  ➡️ Receive a massive kickback in the form of a tax cut when your candidate wins.  ➡️ Spend millions more to keep that candidate in office.  🔁 Wash, rinse, repeat. 
We need action from the President – not more political games. 
Farmers and ranchers aren’t the only people who feel the effects of a downturn in our rural economy. Folks in the city see higher prices at the grocery store, making it that much tougher for working families to put food on the table.
Grateful to and inspired by the folks who came out tonight in Des Moines to fight for a fair shot for all of us.  Join us tomorrow in Marshalltown, Waterloo, Vinton, and Iowa City!  
Some people ask me what my "lane" in this race is. From now on, I'll just direct them to this mug to answer their question. 
The farmers I met with in Rippey, Iowa told me President Trump's trade war is impacting their livelihoods. These folks have farmed for generations and deserve real solutions from a leader who knows the difficulties they face firsthand. Not just platitudes. 
Folks should know what’s at stake:1. ~20 million folks will be kicked off their health insurance plan. 2. Americans could be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions.3. Insurance companies wouldn't have to cover young adults up to age 26 under their parents’ plans. 
What did the Baby Corn say to the Momma Corn? Where's Pop Corn?! Awesome to have one of my favorite jokesters on the trail with me -- my son, Cam. 
Rural families deserve a President who understands their needs. Grateful to Lt. Gov Patty Judge and Wael Sanduka for showing me around POET Biorefinery today, and the work they do every day using renewables to fuel their community and our country. 
Take note: President Donald Trump wants to sell some of the most pristine places on the planet for pennies on the dollar. 
It’s clear has broken the public trust. He should resign.
President Trump is attempting to sabotage our healthcare — after promising us he’d protect it.
The kids in President Trump’s border camps still don’t have access to toothpaste and soap.  Maybe the President should visit the families in the detention facilities he’s running. Then they’d at least have hand sanitizer.

We're fortunate to have many voices in this race, all with the goal of making our nation a better place. is an important voice for the future of our party, a dedicated public servant, and I wish him the best.
It may be easy to avoid the price tag in DC, but as a Governor, I've got to balance my budget. We deserve a government that knows that. 
“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…”
We need your help to make sure public lands stay in public hands. Chip in here: 
The 23 million women living on the tipped minimum wage deserve a raise — and the fair shot at opportunity it brings. It’s time to   
Teddy Roosevelt called conservation “a great moral issue.” I’ve never been afraid to stand up to Big Money and keep public lands in public hands — and you can bet I will never stop doing so.
Our public lands are our birthright as Americans. But through his desire to divide up and sell off our national monuments to the highest bidder, the president has made his disdain for conservation abundantly clear.
“Environmental leadership" does not  include vastly shrinking our public lands and cutting environmental protections at the request of Big Money donors. 
The minimum wage for tipped workers has been frozen at $2.13 for 28 years. I led the effort to raise the minimum wage in Montana because we cannot fight for a fair shot without a living wage. Help us  if you agree:  
Grateful for the chance to participate in Server for an Hour campaign to raise awareness of their fight to raise the subminimum wage for tipped workers. If you're in Denver, drop by

Prescription drugs are costing seniors more than four times their Social Security benefit. That’s called price gouging — and if we get dark money and Big Pharma  out of our politics, we can fix it. Thanks to for their work to shed light on this.
The millions of families struggling to afford prescription drugs cannot afford “soon.” They need real action, now.

The energy from our organizers on the ground in Iowa this weekend was unbelievable. I’m grateful, inspired, and ready to get back to Iowa on Tuesday. Join us:  
We’ve heard almost nothing in this election on protecting our public lands from corporate greed and climate change. Our kids deserve to enjoy those public lands, and they need a President who will fight to protect them for this generation and all that follow.
Congratulations, You are champions on and off the field.
While Donald Trump celebrated Independence Day with a self-indulgent parade, thousands of kids were at the border, torn from their families, sleeping on the floor.We need a change. Now.  
As Republicans wage an unprecedented assault on women’s rights, we’ve got to take every opportunity to stand up and fight back. As Governor, I stopped every single attack on a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions. Every. Single. One.
This isn’t diplomacy, it’s dangerous.

I was raised by a single mom, and was able to pay for college by taking a job picking up my classmates’ plates. I had a fair shot in life. I’m running for President because we should all have one.
We need someone on that stage who has actually won a place Democrats have lost, and I need your help to tell that story. Chip in today: 
We’re qualified for the second Democratic debate and ready to take the stage in July — but to ensure our place in future debates, we’ve got to reach 130,000 donors.

We can’t define success as economic opportunity for only part of America. When nearly 40% of folks in this country can’t afford a $400 emergency, our economy isn’t working for everyone. 
We cannot take meaningful action on healthcare, gun violence, or climate change without first ending Big Money’s grip on our politics. My plan to make that happen: 
“I think in part that’s what happened in 2016. There were parts of the country that just felt like the Democrats didn’t care about them.”
“You might think a town of 25,000 isn’t important, but if folks in Clinton don’t feel that they’re equally as important as folks in Des Moines, well then, in the general election we’re not going to win.”
I’m on with after my Fourth of July swing through Iowa. Tune in!
American stories are those of immigrants, who left their home countries seeking freedom and opportunity. We can’t forget that.
Today, I’m grateful for the men and women who defend the United States, and the good folks doing the work at home to make our country a better place. Thank you. Happy Fourth of July.
America was founded on ideas. We cannot simply assume they’ll be realized — to truly be the Land of the Free, we have to work for it every single day.
Glad to join you and the folks in your district for a beautiful July morning, Glad to see it’s in good hands.

We’ve spent 243 years fighting for the values this nation was built on: the freedom to live, love, and seek the opportunity for a better life for our kids and grandkids. And we’re not stopping now. Happy Fourth of July!
A Type 1 diabetes diagnosis should not cost $700 a month in the most prosperous nation on earth. 
No matter what state she’s in or what circumstance brought her there: every woman deserves the right to make her own healthcare decisions. 
Public lands are our birthright as Americans. To lose them would be to lose a part of our national character.
The truth is, we may not know all the ways Russia interfered with the 2016 elections. And under our current law, we wouldn’t even know if Russian money makes its way into the next election. We have to change that. 
You do not get to decide whether you will follow a Supreme Court decision. As a lawyer and a former Attorney General... trust me on this. 
As a graduate of public school and a father of three kids currently in those same public schools, I know our task is straightforward: we have to invest in our teachers.  
When asked if Russia had influenced our elections, Donald Trump said “I don’t see any reason why it would be.”He embarrasses us on a daily basis. We deserve better.
Yeah, and I am *thrilled* when I run through shin splints.
“I think as time goes on we'll probably see more and more of what these cultures are really all about.”Thanks to the work of folks like Wes, that time will be sooner rather than later. Congratulations, Mr. Studi.
I grew up in Montana’s state capitol — but I only knew there was a Governor’s house in town because I delivered newspapers to it as a kid. I’m running for President because every kid in America deserves the chance to go from the paper route to the Presidency.
The President is destroying our public lands to build his border wall. This has to stop. 
To beat Trump, we’ve got to win back the places that voted for him. I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it again. 
55 years ago, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed into law and we took one step towards true equality for every American. On its anniversary, we must recognize that our work is far from over and continue to move forward.
The Trump First foreign policy puts photo ops over American security.
When I was growing up, the NRA was a group for hunters. Today, it’s a political machine that buys influence. If we’re going to stop the epidemic of gun violence, then we must stop groups like the NRA from buying influence in the first place.
Despicable is an understatement.  
Good. 
3,400 folks in this facility have been held there for longer than the 72 hrs legally permitted. 1,500 people for longer than 10 days.50 children under 7 without their parents. Stop talking and start taking action.
 Look at these photos. These are men, women, and children who came to our country seeking a better life, only to be crammed into overcrowded facilities and denied basic necessities by the Trump Administration. How much more will it take before you act? 
Washington DC hasn’t passed a budget on time in 22 years. Apparently when they’re beholden to Big Money and corporate PACs, they aren’t in any hurry to get things done.I’m running for President because we deserve so much better than that.
It’s time to hold Big Pharma accountable.
Almost 41 drugs have increased their price by 100% in 2019.
Prozac, an antidepressant, is up 879% this year alone.
Want to see price gouging in action?The cost of insulin — a life-saving drug — has doubled in 5 years.
It doesn’t matter if you’re from a red state or a blue state, climate change is a threat to us all. I joined the Alliance to honor the Paris Climate Accord — because if this Administration won't act on the climate crisis, we will.
How to be a Trump official: 1. Work in an industry that gives millions to DC politicians.2. Get an influential job in the administration. 3. Return to your company and use your new relationships to increase profits at the expense of working families.
Big Money and corporate PACs have been buying influence in our elections for generations. They’ve purchased the power to write their own laws and give themselves free rein to shape our country as they see fit. This Election Day, we’re taking that power back.
Last week we watched four hours of Democratic debates. The corrupting influence of Big Money in politics was discussed for... 84 seconds. That’s. Not. Enough. Donate here to change it come July and help me make the next debate stage: 
It is a huge, massive, loss. 
No one should be forced into a healthcare crisis because of partisan politics. The privatization of Medicaid puts the profits of corporations over the well-being of families and entire communities, plain and simple. 
The NRA doesn’t just own Congress. They own the White House. On Election Day, we take it all back.
Not even close. 
Beating Donald Trump is the bare minimum. We have to categorically reject the behavior he’s normalized. 
Climate change is a threat to our entire way of life. We can either sit back and do nothing, or we can actually do something about it. For the sake of our kids and the planet they will inherit, we  choose action. 
It is a huge, massive, loss. 
This is the consequence of Donald Trump’s ‘America Alone’ foreign policy: Iran is now closer to attaining a nuclear weapon than when Trump took office. We need to put our national security before political grandstanding. 
The United States is the only place that Dreamers like Bruna have ever called home.They have suffered through painful uncertainty long enough. We need a permanent solution for our Dreamers. 
On Thursday, we celebrate our nation’s highest ideals of freedom and respect for all.On Friday, Donald Trump will trample those values as he tears families apart. We deserve so much better in our country. And in this election, we must demand it. 
Let the doctors in. 
Timeline of the Opioid Crisis: 1. Pharma companies flood DC lawmakers with cash to drive up their bottom lines. 2. Washington chose inaction in the face of an epidemic. 
I can answer that question right now. On Day One, we start getting rid of Big Money in politics. My plan:  
✅Big Pharma  these groups spend millions to buy influence, Washington does nothing to take on the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, act on climate change, and tackle the gun violence epidemic.But we can fix it. My plan: 
"You all said you would never forget. Well, I'm here to make sure that you don't.”Luis Alvarez should not have had to spend his final days advocating for the healthcare he deserves. He and all 9/11 first responders are heroes forever.
Together, we can make sure the country our kids and grandkids inherit is one they can be proud of. 
Millionaires get huge tax cuts, while income inequality hit record highs. Big Pharma spends millions to influence our government, yet we pay more for healthcare than any other industrialized nation — with nothing to show for it.I have a plan to fix it. 
✅Skyrocketing Healthcare Costs (Pharma, insurers)✅Climate Crisis (energy companies)✅Gun Violence Epidemic (NRA)We cannot tackle our biggest crises without first addressing the toxic influence of Big Money in our elections.
The ugly, racist attacks against represent the worst of us. As Americans, we’ve got to call out conspiracy theories like these — rooted in nothing less than hatred — when we see them.

Before Citizens United, dark money groups accounted for just 2% of outside spending. Now it’s over half — and it’s impossible to tell definitively if foreign money is being used in our elections. My plan to fix it:

Let’s not forget that Trump ran a fraudulent for-profit "university" that stole millions from students. Now his administration continues to put private profit over our kids' futures.

I went from delivering newspapers to the Governor's house as a kid to raising my three kids in it.Everyone in America deserves that fair shot at success. 
Our kids deserve better than inaction in the face of crisis. 
4 hours of debates. 84 seconds on money in politics. 0 questions on ending Dark Money. We must do better at the next debate. 
We’ve got to hold Big Pharma accountable for the damage they’ve done.
End the grip of money in politics is the fight of my career and it has to be a focus of the next debate. Chip in now to get me on that stage: 
We have to do more than just win this election — we have to make Washington work for us. Not for Big Money, not for the special interests, but for each one of us.
Two debates, four hours, 20 candidates. Not a single question on Big Money in politics.
The Little Shell Tribe has been recognized as a sovereign nation by Montana for years. This bill needs to go to Donald Trump, and he needs to sign it.

It's not hard: we must listen to scientists. Climate change is an immediate threat. We must take immediate and durable action to combat it. 
PS: If anyone needs a playbook on fighting dark money:  
It's no wonder nothing gets done in Washington. All they do is talk (often past each other).
It may be easy to avoid the price tag in DC, but as a Governor, I've got to balance my budget. We've got to pay for our proposals. Period.
I’m here live bringing reactions straight to you. Good luck everybody! 
I was raised by a single mom, and we lived paycheck to paycheck. I worked my way through college and borrowed my way through law school — and I got my shot at the American Dream. We all deserve that shot. That's why I'm running for President.
I’m the only one in this field who’s won in a state that Trump won — and we need to win back those places we lost. It’s not going to be enough to just be against Trump, we’ve actually got to give folks a reason to vote for us.
20% of rural hospitals in the country are at risk of closure right now. We’ve got to recognize that if we lose our rural hospitals, we risk losing our rural towns.
I believe we can break this dysfunction. It’s not going to be easy, but I’ve seen it done firsthand.
We need to get universal background checks — and the majority of Republicans and NRA members actually agree with that. Let’s get it done.
Prescription drug companies spend more on advertising than on research. I’ve never met anyone who says they’re giving us a fair shake. 
I bring a perspective where I’ve had to balance budgets and actually govern. 
I go directly to the districts and I talk to folks, because most people outside Washington actually want government to function and make a positive impact on their lives. That’s how we’ll beat Mitch McConnell.
When it comes to Mitch McConnell, it's not going to be enough to sit in DC and take the case to Senators. You need to make the case to the rest of the country.
From where I sit, the question ought to be: why are Democrats losing those places that we used to win, not should we be blowing up the overall system of the Electoral College.
Republicans won’t even acknowledge that climate change is human caused, because of the outside influence of spending in our elections.
The Secretary of Interior says he doesn’t lose sleep over climate change. As a father of 3 kids, as someone who’s dealt with fire seasons now 78 days longer than when I was growing up, you bet I lose sleep over it.
No one that presents at our borders should be treated like animals, and that’s what this administration is doing.
We have to win back some of those places that we lost — but it has to be more than just being against

"Bullock laid out his plans for securing the US border, addressing the migrant crisis and what to do about Dreamers and the millions of others who live in America illegally."
If we don't change our strategy — if we don't both turn out Democrats and win back some of the voters we lost in the last election — we will lose to Trump again and we will deserve to. 
I've been focused on winning back the places we lost. That's why tonight I spoke directly with voters in a televised town hall in Iowa and will do the same in New Hampshire tomorrow.
As the only candidate who has won a Trump state, it was clear that a critical voice was missing from the debate stage tonight.
When you see the effects of climate change firsthand, you see that inaction is no longer an option. As Governor, I led the efforts to expand clean energy solutions, quadrupling our solar and doubling wind generation.
There’s only one right answer here: climate change is a global threat. We must take immediate and durable action to combat it.  
It’s time to treat gun violence like the public health crisis it is — and rid our political system of the Big Money groups like the standing in the way of solutions. 
Here's how I slipped past the DNC official guarding the door: I started talking about rural issues and they stopped paying attention. 
Donald Trump has brought us to the brink of war to satisfy his own ego. We deserve real, responsible foreign policy — not political brinkmanship. 
Our immigration system has gone from a bureaucratic nightmare to a moral crisis. We deserve leaders who are ready to take real, meaningful action. I’m ready to do this on Day One.  
We are witnessing an unprecedented assault on a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions. As Governor, I’ve stopped every attack on a woman’s right to make those choices, and that’s exactly what I’ll do as President.  
As a Governor, you get judged on results — not on speeches or grandstanding. I’d put my success expanding and protecting healthcare to nearly 100,000 people against anyone.

 is absolutely right: corporate Big Money and the climate denial they push are two sides of the same coin. We’ve got to address them both.
We cannot run from the climate crisis. Whether this Administration takes action or not, climate change is real — and it’s a threat to our way of life.
Big Money has stained our political system for too long. If we want to see real, structural change, there’s only one logical first step: ridding our politics of Big Money entirely.
DC has become a place where talking has become the substitute for actually getting things done. As a Governor, I don’t have that luxury.

Building a wall is an 18th century solution to a 21st century problem — and no matter who asks the question, my answer will be the same. 
Trump's own party knew the serious problems with his administration. Yet again and again they chose silence and complicity over action.
There’s only one right answer here: climate change is a global threat. We must take immediate and durable action to combat it.
This article is a tough read. But we have an obligation to know the cruelty being committed, speak out against it, and fight to stop it.

“People are starting to say, ‘I don’t know how we’re going to survive this,’  said Martinmaas, who voted for Trump in 2016, but says he’s open to a Democrat like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock this time."

We’re good, thanks. 
Forcing children to endure these cruel and needless conditions is wrong. We must do better.
It is not going to be enough to just be against Donald Trump. We’ve got to be for a strong economy,  affordable healthcare, and a good public education for our kids ⁠— the bread and butter of what makes folks’ lives better.

When I was growing up, 90% of 30 year olds were doing better than their parents were at that age. Today it’s only half. But we can do something about it. This election is about winning back our country and making sure everyone has a fair shot at success. 
Standing up for reproductive healthcare has never been more urgent. Trump’s actions are an attack on women and families across our country.
We deserve a President who fights against the corrupt system — not one who creates it. 
As our President uses fear in an attempt to divide us, it’s more important than ever to make clear: we stand with those yearning to breathe free and we always will.

There is no way to hide it. This administration provides hand outs to the wealthy while literally ripping food away from hungry Americans.
Trump is painting his plane while farmers in Iowa are under water, kids are being separated from their families, and workers haven't had a real wage increase in forty years. This election is about priorities. This President has got them wrong.

There is nothing that keeps me going like someone letting me know that they feel heard. 
“The challenges of our time call for someone with the proven ability to bring Americans together — Republican, independent, and Democrat alike — to get things done.That’s exactly what Bullock has done throughout his entire career.”
Getting progressive things done in a state Trump won by 20 points is a record that should animate our political discussion. Instead, that commitment could be what keeps me off the debate stage at the end of the month.

Dark money groups like those run by the Koch Brothers used the dead of night to tear away 40 years of collective bargaining rights.They rammed through a tax bill that benefits those at the top, not working families.
Iowans and I have a lot in common… including our reaction to the debate rules.

I had a shot in life: I grew up to be the Governor of Montana and a candidate for President of the United States. But today, too many kids growing can’t count on those same opportunities — the promise that if you work hard, you can succeed.

If the DNC rules are trying to shape who’s going to be in this campaign against Donald Trump in 2020, when voters are still 250 days away from even expressing a preference, democracy suffers.
No, thanks. 
We are doing everything we can to reach 65,000 donors. So I'm asking you: can you chip in $1 this morning? 
If I had to decide between campaigning for 100,000 donors or getting 100,000 people healthcare, that’s the easiest decision I’ve ever had to make. 
It’s about winning back the places we lost, getting rid of the dark money that has taken over our political system, and ensuring every person in America has a fair shot at success. I sure hope you’ll join us: 
We need a candidate that can both get Democrats fired up to vote and win back the places that voted for Trump, and I’m the only candidate who’s done it. I need your support because this is about a lot more than one debate.
I agree with Chairman that every candidate has to demonstrate progress to make that stage. But if progress isn’t what we’ve been able to achieve in Montana, our Party’s definition of progress needs to change.
These rules are not the standard our Party should be setting. If we're ever going to get beyond partisan gridlock and back to governing, we must include those who have done the hard work to get things done outside of Washington.
But the DNC’s new debate rules threaten to keep us off the debate stage because I didn’t get in earlier. The truth is if I ever had to choose again between campaigning for 100,000 donors and securing healthcare for 100,000 people; well, that’s the easiest decision I’ll ever make.
We had a job to do in Montana. And we did it.
I don’t regret for a minute waiting so long to launch my campaign. Nothing is more important to me than the work we did to expand Medicaid, freeze college tuition, ban foreign money from state elections, and protect a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions.
Here's how you win a Trump state: you show up, you listen, and you recognize that no matter who you vote for, folks generally want the same things in life. We can win in Trump states, and we can take our country back.

You proposed ripping healthcare away from transgender people 6 days ago. 
This is encouraging news, but our fight isn’t over. Every woman has the right to make her own healthcare decisions, and we cannot stop saying it or fighting for these rights.
This is a humanitarian crisis, not a reason to tax working families and start a trade war.
Tackling money in politics is the first step towards addressing climate change, skyrocketing healthcare costs, income inequality — and all of the biggest crises of our time.
Washington DC can learn a lot from what we’ve done in Montana, but I'm not so naive to think it’ll be easy. It all starts with tackling the corrupt influence of money in politics. Here's how we're going to do it:  
Lindsey Graham literally told his caucus to pass Trump’s tax plan or else their big money donors would walk away. South Carolina, you deserve better than Senator Graham — and you’ve found it in 
This has to stop. Trump is using a trade war to push his divisive policies—and it’s American families and businesses who are paying the price. 
We aren’t just going to beat Donald Trump. We’re going to build a government that actually works again. 
Two obstacles stand in the way of America once again being the land of the free: the divisive presidency of Donald Trump and the corrupting influence of big money in politics.
Remember Trump’s tax law? He gave away billions to corporate treasuries, but the average worker got just $28.(Oh, and we still haven’t seen his tax returns.)
If we’re going to take back this country, we've got to support folks who take on the corrupt system to make change in places others may not expect. South Carolina is lucky to have at the ready to

We can make Donald Trump a one-term President. thank you for the work you do to make that dream a reality. 
This is divisive, cruel, and as far from our American values as you can get. But I was actually in district this week. And I saw folks coming together to fight for a fair shot for everyone. Everyone. This is a fight we can win. 
I had a 60% Republican legislature — even more of a majority than they have in Washington DC. But we were able to come together to pass Medicaid expansion, freeze college tuition, and pass one of the strongest anti-dark money laws in the country. 
How low can he go. 
Make no mistake: this is Donald Trump turning his back on working families in Montana and states like it across the country.We shouldn't be denying these students a fair shot — we should be working every day to guarantee it.
The DNC just increased the number of donors we need to qualify for the next round of debates. And honestly, we could be kept from taking the stage. But if you chip in today, it’ll get us that much closer to bringing our fight for a fair shot nationwide: 
One of these things just doesn't belong. 
Together, we can make Donald Trump a one-term President. 
When I speak with voters in Iowa and across the country, I hear concerns about the costs of healthcare, cost of living, and sharing in the opportunity of our country. We should expect our leaders to focus on both.
Congress should fulfill its constitutionally empowered oversight of this Administration.
Thank you to for hosting a great conversation last night! 
Indianola, thanks for coming out. Together we're fighting for the fair shot we all deserve. If you're with us, chip in today:  
We need to go everywhere, listen more than we talk, and really show working people that we will fight for them — regardless of who they’ve voted for in the past. 
A "strange name" with a big heart. Uncle Nancy’s was one of my first stops on the campaign trail — thanks for such a warm welcome to Newton! 
We pay more for healthcare than any other industrialized nation — with nothing to show for it. If we’re going to take on the biggest crises of our time, we have to tackle the corrupting influence of money in politics head-on. 
People need a driver’s license to keep a job and make a living. Period. That’s why in Montana, your license can no longer be suspended because you can’t pay a fine. thank you for your support on this. 
We cannot just beat Donald Trump. We've got to return to the task of building that more perfect union and ensuring a fair shot for everyone.Thank you Mason City, for coming together to get us started. 
Everywhere I go, I tell folks the same thing: if we can chase the Koch Brothers out of Montana’s elections, we can do it all across our country. Let’s get to work. 
Climate change is a threat to our way of life. Donald Trump may not be losing sleep over it, but as the Governor of a state dealing with record wildfires and the father of three kids, I am.
See you tomorrow, Cyclones! RSVP here: 
Iowa, I can't wait to see you again tomorrow. Join us in Mason City, Ames, and Indianola:  
'America First' has become 'America Alone.' 
We have to do more than just win this election — we have to make Washington work for us. Not for Big Money, not for the special interests, but for every single one of us in the communities we call home. Here's my plan to do it: 
Big Pharma cuts some of the biggest checks in politics, yet we now pay more for healthcare and prescription drugs than any other country—with nothing to show for it.As Big Oil reaps record profits, our politicians stand by and do literally nothing to deal with climate change.
Big Money has broken the political system’s power to take even the first step towards solving the biggest crises of our time. Millionaires get huge tax cuts, while nearly half of Americans can’t spare $400 if they have a family emergency.
Here's the understatement of the century: Washington DC is broken.
We're taking this fight all the way to Washington DC, but we need your help. Chip in $1 today: 
Montana's flags are at half staff this morning as we honor the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. We're a grateful nation.  
In Montana, we passed Medicaid expansion and the most progressive anti-dark money laws in the country through a 60% Republican legislature. I know firsthand: even as we’re more divided than we’ve ever been in my lifetime, government can still work. 
Another attack on the ACA, another attack on Americans’ healthcare. All LGBTQ+ people deserve access to high quality, affordable care. These political stunts are putting lives on the line, and we have to fight back. 
I’ll be in Iowa on Tuesday, Dad joke-off? 
Good to have S’more family time before the next trip! 
“We need a president who can lead us through the traffic jam. I believe Bullock will be that president. He listens. He reaches across old dividing lines to find new ways forward.”Thank you! Join us back in Iowa next week: 
Our nation is founded on the basic idea that every voice matters. Yet too often it's those who cut the biggest checks who wield the most influence. Together, we can change that. Join us:  
These young people got their fair shot in life because of the good jobs and valuable skills they learned through the Jobs Corp. The Trump Administration’s decision does nothing but rip that opportunity away.
The highest paid CEOs got a median raise of $1.1 million—even as American workers haven’t had a pay raise in real terms for 40 years. We can get our country back on track, but that starts with ensuring every working family gets a fair shot at success. 
These attacks must stop. In the face of these repeated efforts to undermine every woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions, we must continue to speak up — and fight back. 
We’re building a team that can listen, learn, and show up in every community. Join us as we fight for a fair shot for everyone: 
Trump is normalizing behavior that has never, ever before been acceptable. 
A fair shot for everyone means a system uncorrupted by Big Money, leaders unrestrained by special interests, and a bad Election Night for Donald Trump.
I'm still thinking about the folks I met in Iowa last week — teachers, small business owners, and students. I'm grateful, I'm energized, and I'm ready to see you again on Tuesday:  
When we first met while working with Jeff said something that's stuck with me ever since: "I can’t think of anything more patriotic than taking care of our kids.”That’s what this campaign is all about. Thank you for your support, Jeff. 
Donald Trump is using taxpayer dollars to try and fix a problem of his own making. This isn’t a game — not to our allies on the world stage, and not to the farmers struggling here at home.
I'm running for these three, and for the America we pass on to the next generation. 
It’s time for McDonald's to do better. I stand with the brave men and women across the country speaking up for fair treatment and an equal shot at success. 
Where I’m from, you’re not judged on a speech you gave or how many Twitter followers you might have. You’re judged by how many people actually have healthcare, and if they’re getting the fair shot they deserve. 
 “I’ve done more… on the one issue that’s holding us back from everything else, from giving folks a fair shot in the econo…
It's impossible to fully address climate change without facing the influence of Big Oil money head-on. As they reap huge profits, our government stands by and does literally nothing to deal with climate change. 
I got a $400 million infrastructure package through, and I didn’t even have to threaten anyone. 
Washington has been so throughoughly corrupted by Big Money that it's become unable to tackle our biggest challenges — that included the skyrocketing cost of insulin. 
I’m the only candidate in this race to win a Trump state. In the same year Trump won Montana by 20 points, I won by 4. 
Welcome home, Wade. 
I would not pardon Trump if he’s charged after he leaves office. That’s it. That’s the tweet.

These women are standing up for their community, their families, and themselves. I am inspired by their bravery, and stand with them as they call on to end sexual harassment and respect their right to unionize. 
We all have an obligation to stand up for a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions. Today, join a  event to say loud and clear: we cannot go back. 
When you show up and listen, it's easy to realize that there's more that unites us than divides us. Thank you to to the Meskwaki Nation for hosting me. 
I heard stories like this all over rural Iowa last week. Folks struggling to afford their healthcare, or worried they don’t have enough savings to pay for an unexpected emergency. Nobody should have to leave their home just to have a fair shot at success. 
Dang, I could talk about this all day. How we’re going to kick Big Money out of politics and make Washington work for us: 
This is not that hard. On Day 1 of my campaign, I made public 14 years of my tax returns.Trump is the first president in the modern era to not release his tax returns. Let’s make sure he’s the last. 
Twitter, the time has come: we're getting ready to launch our campaign store. What merch do you want to see?
400 graduating seniors now see a future unencumbered by student debt, thanks to the generosity of Robert Smith. I am inspired by his gift and by our shared vision: a day when a fair shot at success is within reach of every American. 
We're at a dangerous point in the 243 year experiment we call representative democracy. If we want to take our democracy back, we must first back the places we lost in 2016. 
I just announced my candidacy for President. I’m ready to take on Donald Trump and defeat the corrupt system that keeps people like him in power. This is the fight of our time, but I need your help. Can you sign up to join my team today? It only takes a second &gt;&gt;
As Governor of Montana, I worked with a Republican legislature to pass one of the most progressive campaign finance laws in our country. I’m running for President to take this fight to Washington and overturn Citizens United once and for all. Add your name to join our campaign:

We’re going to win this thing by going everywhere and talking to everyone — including folks who may not have heard from us in a while. Thank you for your donation. 
Washington DC has been so corrupted by money in politics that it's become unable to face our biggest challenges. Let's fix that together.
Without the money spent by oil and gas companies, we could finally tackle climate change and protect our public lands.
If Big Pharma didn't buy lawmakers, 18 year old Dillon wouldn't be forced to consider rationing his insulin. 
I'm running for President because every American deserves a fair shot at success. But the influence of Big Money in politics is standing in the way.
My Montana values make me who I am, and they’re exactly what Washington needs. 
I left Iowa with clear eyes and a full heart. Can’t wait to be back! 
This is an all-hands-on-deck moment. Thank you and the folks at for the important work you do.

Clinton County went red in 2016, after voting consistently for Obama. These are the places we need to go, and stories we need to hear, if we’re ever going to win them back. 
After a great trip through Iowa with AG Tom Miller, I’m on my way to See you tomorrow morning 
We are more divided as a nation than at anytime in my lifetime. But yesterday in Independence, a room full of people gathered to fight for the fair shot they and their families deserve. I can’t wait to be back.
Thanks for letting me crash your brunch! Finish off that beer for me. 
Gave away my best dad joke on national television the other day. If you have a possible replacement... let me know. 
When I say I’m going everywhere — I mean everywhere. Good morning from Maquoketa, and thanks to everyone who joined us on this early and rainy Saturday. Every one of us deserves a fair shot.

The stakes have never been higher, and we need to get this right. Take it from Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller: 
This is an all-hands-on-deck moment. As President, I will fight to protect Roe and if the new Supreme Court majority overturns it, immediately push to codify its protections into law. 
Some of my most enriching memories as Governor are with Montana’s Tribal communities. Thank you to the Meskwaki Tribe here in Tama for inviting me to listen, learn, and share our experiences. 
We’re here in Jasper County, a county that flipped to Trump in 2016 after voting for Obama in 2008 and 2012. We can take these places back — we just have to show up. 
We are here today to make sure Donald Trump is a one term President. 
To me, you are perfect.

What a welcome. Thank you Des Moines! 
Great to see you too, AG Miller! What a welcome back to Iowa. Next stop, — see you there!  
We need to do more than beat Donald Trump. We need to fight the corrupting influence of money in politics so that our democracy works for all of us—not just the Donald Trumps and the Koch Brothers of the world.
Don't know about the dusty vistas, but I do rock a dad jean.
Our kids are watching — and learning — from us. Let’s show them we‘re still capable of moving past division and solving our toughest challenges. 
We can’t write off parts of the country just because we didn’t do well there in 2016. If we do, we’ll lose. And we’ll deserve to. 
I'm talking with on at 2:20 pm. We're going to win this election the only way I know how: by going everywhere and talking with everyone. Hope you're able to tune in.

This is irresponsible, dangerous and would make it even more difficult for women to access basic healthcare. As governor, I’ve stopped every attack on a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions, and that’s exactly what I’ll do as president. 
As my wife Lisa introduced me yesterday, she handed out her favorite quote: the full text of Roosevelt's “man in the arena." As much as the text inspires me, it isn't entirely complete. Lisa is with me in every arena I enter. I couldn't do this without her.
"He has supported same-sex marriage, net neutrality and held pro-choice views on abortion. He also worked with the Republican-controlled legislature to push through some of the most sweeping campaign finance reforms in the country.”
Our place on the world stage is going to be in jeopardy if we can’t overcome our division. Donald Trump is the only thing standing in our way. 
It's time we defeat the corrupt system that lets campaign money drown out our voice. This is the fight of our time. It's been the fight of my career. Find out more:

This is the fight of our time, and it’s been the fight of my career. It's a big task. So here's my plan: 
Para que todos reciban la oportunidad justa que se merecen, tenemos que hacer más que derrotar a Trump. Vamos a derrotar al sistema corrupto que mantiene a las personas como él en puestos de poder. Por eso quiero ser tu Presidente:
