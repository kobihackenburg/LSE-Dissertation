I’ll be interested in the remaining Iowa vote totals as I think there are many counties on the outskirts where we performed very well that have not yet come in.
Now to see if we can top that several times over in NH where MANY more people vote on a percentage basis and voting is far easier AND the message hits home most directly. I think we can.
Early returns in Iowa have us at 5.2% of the popular vote. Not far from projections going in - THANK YOU to everyone who worked hard to get us there.  😀👍🙏

“the Granite State may now become the de-facto opening night of the Democratic race in next week's primary.”  - CNN
My takeaway from Monday night:  this race is a muddled mess. That means the opportunity for us is growing because there isn’t a clear front runner or even field.  New Hampshire will be more important than ever.

The truth is I don’t think Mike particularly wants to debate. He could easily have gotten himself onto the stage with the donor requirements.

Happily the growth has not slowed. We are still growing fast and have many exciting developments ahead of us. It’s almost voting time - it’s almost time for the people to make their voice heard. There will be no denying our strength then. We will continue to earn it.
We released polls showing us at 5% in New Hampshire and Nevada - and we are clearly there in Iowa according to the most authoritative poll in the industry. We were at 5% nationally in a PBS poll. We have grown more consistently than any other campaign through grassroots support.
Thank you to everyone who worked so hard and gave so much to get us on the debate stage this week. I want us to be on that stage. I think we earned it. Now let’s make sure we make the next one in February. It’s yet our time. Let’s show that this campaign cannot be stopped.
 You know it.  😀👍🏀

This decision highlights the need to get Donald Trump out of office. We need better decision making in the White House that does not escalate violence but instead invests in diplomacy to achieve our national interests.

 I find this data point very compelling.
First I would give every American $1,000 a month so that we all are in better position to benefit from and participate in our shared progress. 5G would have massive ramifications on the economy and workforce.
The race to deploy 5G is on between the US and China - this is a race we must win. I would scale up federal investments and coordination and fund the training and apprenticeship of tens of thousands of technicians.

 Andrew Yang got a bigger favorability bump than any other 2020 Democrat after the December debate 
Our healthcare expenses of $3.6 trillion are almost $12,000 per person per year. A couple thousand dollars a year to ‘spend’ on things that make us healthier would go a very long way.
Happy Holidays from our little  to yours!  😀🌲🎉 
If we spent a fraction of the money we spend in our healthcare system on actually keeping people healthy it would transform everything. We should be paying people to go to the gym/yoga studio/nutritionist instead of vice versa.

If the media spent a fraction of the time they are spending on impeachment on the economic dislocations that got Trump elected we would be a stronger country for it.
Watching impeachment unfold is like watching a game when you know the final score.

In 2016, Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes. 200,000 votes can swing an election. Our democracy doesn't work if people are prevented from voting. We need to fight for people's right to vote or face the same results.

I’ve been asked what I think about Iowa’s outsized role in the presidential nomination process. I like Iowans. I find them to have a ton of common sense. They elevated Barack Obama in ‘08 - they have demonstrated an ability to judge based on who would move the country forward.
Fantastic time bowling with Iowans in Davenport! 

A couple of journalists have asked me whether I feel a responsibility to represent all people of color on the debate stage next week. I tell them that is impossible - our communities are too diverse for that. Most Americans I meet are concerned about very similar things.

I agree with proceeding with impeachment - it’s the right thing to do. But there is potential for it to increase polarization and galvanize the President’s base particularly if impeachment doesn’t succeed. We need to provide a new positive vision to move the country forward.

The whole time we have gotten stronger. This is actually bad for MSNBC. It will only get worse after I make the next debates and keep rising in the polls. The people are smarter than MSNBC would like to think.
They’ve omitted me from their graphics 12+ times, called me John Yang on air, and given me a fraction of the speaking time over 2 debates despite my polling higher than other candidates on stage. At some point you have to call it.
Was asked to appear on this weekend - and told them that I’d be happy to after they apologize on-air, discuss and include our campaign consistent with our polling, and allow surrogates from our campaign as they do other candidates’. They think we need them. We don’t.
I’m not ahead of my time. It just seems like it because we are used to government lagging behind by decades.
Also said: “You have to win.”

 If you’d like to sit down and have a debate on this I would enjoy it.  We could livestream it and let people decide for themselves. This is one of the great issues of our time and it deserves careful consideration. 👍
The Knicks drama is something else.  They should clean house - but it’s hard to fire yourself.
Glad that Melo is back in the league!  He deserves a different final run.  Hope he helps the Blazers.
 Instead of citing a backward-looking stat why not get out and visit with the technologists, labor leaders, factory workers, educators, retail workers, truckers, Amazon facility workers and others who are experiencing this day-to-day? You might have a different perspective.
 It’s hard to see why you are so dismissive. McKinsey, MIT, BCG, Oxford, the Obama White House, the World Bank and just about every other org who has looked at this is deeply concerned about automation. They see the same stats you and I do.
 Thanks Paul. The productivity growth stat could be a result of the fact that many workers are being pushed into - or stuck in - low productivity sectors as a means of survival. It could also be a lagging indicator.  As you know it’s hard to pack every stat into an Op-Ed.

 Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang wants your data to be your property  
 our new ad is LIVE in New Hampshire and on our website! Watch it now -; 
I like Deval Patrick. I think he is going to have a tough time getting in the race at this juncture. It’s November. It’s hard to have thousands of face-to-face conversations with early state voters at this point. It’s hard to build passion on a dime. He has an uphill climb ahead.
The first thing is to make it harder to get access to guns, particularly for young people. We need to take action on federal gun safety legislation that most Americans agree is long overdue. We owe our kids this. They deserve action. They deserve better than this.
Too many young boys and men in particular are falling through the cracks in ways that can become catastrophic. We have to rebuild our capacity to form and educate healthy boys and men.
As the parent of two school age boys this is our worst nightmare come to life. I can only imagine the pain, anguish and heartbreak of the families. No one should fear sending their kids to school or going to school.
The high school shooting in Santa Clarita is horrifying. My heart goes out to the families and children - our kids deserve better. We have to fight gun violence and shootings at every level, from firearm laws on down. The time for action is long past - we must do more than mourn.

Had a blast with this morning - missed you 😀👍 
Having spent a lot of time in Iowa and New Hampshire with voters I have been blown away by how seriously they take their duty to vet candidates. The culture has been built over decades. They compare you to candidates from past cycles. When you see it up close you appreciate it.

Bottom line - it takes a lot of heart to run. “It is not the critic who counts . . The credit belongs to [he or she] in the arena .. who strives valiantly .. because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds” - T. Roosevelt
I could easily be on this list myself if not for the  and the fact that I always knew I was staying in no matter what - I never had another race to run or a post to return to. This was always a one-way trip.
The press makes it seem like a horse race. Each candidate is a human being on the road away from loved ones. Not many know what it feels like from the inside. I appreciate everyone who stepped up. Win or lose.
I like and admire most everyone on this list. Some I consider friends. You get to know people on the road. You bond in unexpected ways.

Just got a letter from my son’s school about the first shooter drill of the year. 4 are required each year by the district. We should make these drills optional - they make our kids anxious and confused and create an atmosphere of fear while their benefits are unclear.

Anything you do that touches voters in the early states is worth its weight in gold - canvassing, phonebanking, textbanking, visiting, talking to friends and relatives who live there. It’s time to reach out to that cousin or classmate you haven’t talked to in a while.  👍
The fact is we have bigger goals than making the debates. It’s go time  - it’s time to build on the momentum we have created and start opening hearts and minds at scale. I am pumped up and I hope you are too.  💪🇺🇸🚀
We are now investing directly in the early states via staff, organizing and advertising. Fundraising will now have a direct relationship to polling results in the early states.
We have hit 4%+ in polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina as well as nationally so this is very achievable. And in Nevada we get 3%. We have already blown through the 200,000 donor number by 100,000 or so. 😀
That’s the kind of thing you think about when you touch down in Vegas.
Strengths. Weaknesses. Virtues. Defects. Courage. Fear. Resilience. Fragility. Abundance. Scarcity. Self-love. Self-hate. We’ve each got all of them. We each contain multitudes.

Q:  Do you think should get impeached?- 
 My baseline is half the average European level. Could be tailored to fall more heavily on tech and luxury goods and less on consumer staples.
 I would love to solve for this problem and believe there are ways we can do it. The Freedom Dividend would certainly help all creators. I’d explore micropayments and transfers where when you watch something and enjoy it the creator gets a tiny payment. They’d add up quickly.
The  no question 😃

Excited to answer tons of voter questions starting at 10 am EST today!  Got my sleeping bag and MATH hat and water bottle ready.  😀👍
I wrote a book that presents the data 
I also approached the problem having spent 7 years working with hundreds of entrepreneurs in Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, Baltimore, Birmingham, New Orleans and other communities around the country. I saw what was happening. The data bore out my experiences.
I honestly approached the data interested in what I’d find. It painted a pretty clear picture to me. I didn’t have an agenda. I wish our labor market were more dynamic and that the adjustments were happening. But they aren’t. By the numbers.
What has blown me away is how lazily dubious some journalists and pundits are. Dig into the data and make a balanced determination. Don’t dismiss it because you wish it weren’t true and you prefer another story.
Are there data points that muddy the picture? Yes. But it is indisputable that 4 to 5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the US since 2000, largely in OH, PA, MI, WI and IA, and that a lot of that has been due to automation, technology and machines. Start there.
Here is Oxford saying 1.5 million additional US manufacturing jobs will be lost to robots by 2030 
Here is McKinsey saying 23% of US jobs impacted by automation by 2030 
Here is the Obama White House saying that 83% of jobs making less than $20 an hour are highly likely to be automated away.  
An honest approach to the automation issue would be to say “Huh, is that a problem? Let me do a little digging.”  Dismissing a problem doesn’t make it go away.

You know who the Sixers should sign for the playoffs?
I think the Warriors are going to have a very tough year. Their depth is gone and they are going to run Curry ragged. I’m not sure they make the playoffs.
In the East I think the Sixers are top heavy but scary. They are ginormous and talented. If they stay healthy they could beat anyone. They could use a vet guard or two. Horford is invaluable.

The Clippers need one more quality defensive big. Someone like Joakim Noah or Andrew Bogut.
I will say the Lakers may have a higher ceiling and would have homecourt in any series. The Hallway Series is back.  (Billy Crystal)
Clippers over Lakers is tough. Kawhi just proved he could do it. Doc is a proven championship coach. Quality veteran depth.
If the Market is right about Us then parents, caregivers, nurturers, volunteers and too often artists, journalists, mentors and musicians are worth next to nothing.

As a Knicks fan from childhood I think is telling it like it is.  Banning Oakley and a fan from MSG, alienating KP and having zero record of player development is not exactly what you’re looking for in a franchise. We haven’t been cool in a long time.

 USA TODAY: UBI is Social Security for the 21st century. Andrew Yang's plan would help Americans-damn right!.
The question is how do we generate an environment and culture in which a mindset of scarcity is less pervasive. Getting the economic boot off of people’s throats would help immensely. So would a higher degree of empathy and compassion. The opposite of scarcity is abundance.
We all struggle with a mindset of scarcity sometimes - whether it be tied to self-worth, money, time to oneself, accomplishment, companionship, food or other basic human need. In good times we recognize the doubt and laugh it off. In bad times it becomes the only thing you hear.

One reason I’m passionate about the Freedom Dividend is that it will dramatically increase the resources available to non-profits and make them more responsive to different kinds of problems. Too many orgs are living hand-to-mouth while the problems they are addressing only grow.
As someone who founded and ran a non-profit for 7 years I understand the work that non-profit leaders do:  championing their cause and presenting a vision. Trying to solve a problem while simultaneously gathering resources. Building a team. It’s beautiful but very tough work.
This weekend in South Carolina a non-profit leader said I was his role model.  That meant a lot to me.

I make mistakes all of the time. It’s part of being human.
We all know that presidential campaigns focus on a handful of swing states and the rest of the country gets left out. The best way to change this would be for each state to allocate its electors in proportion to its popular vote - we’d campaign everywhere.

 I do believe that no one should be working and be poor - but that we should recognize parents and caregivers as well. A Freedom Dividend is a more effective way to give Americans a raise and recognize different forms of work in my view.  I’m for all approaches. 👍
At least one person who has won the Freedom Dividend has not responded to the email - so if you got an email with the subject line ‘Freedom Dividend Pilot Program - please respond” you should open it.  😀🇺🇸
 Germany, France, Denmark, Ireland and other countries tried a wealth tax and repealed it later. If we can’t learn from the experience of other countries then we have very limited data to rely upon when setting policy.
I’m thrilled to share the first winners of the Freedom Dividend! Giving people money and seeing their reactions is the best feeling - they will do great things with it. Let’s make it happen for all Americans.  😀💪🇺🇸

If $1,000 a month would make no difference in your life you should probably be for other people getting it.
 automation is depressing American worker compensation and making it hard for workers to ask for more.  We should just give Americans a raise.
Technically going up by 3.5 times quarter over quarter isn’t ‘exponential growth’ - but it’s pretty close.  😀
 You are confusing me with someone else - I like to give people money not take it away.  😀
A Democracy Dollars bill that put $100 into every voter’s hands each year to contribute to campaigns and candidates would be a much more effective way to overcome corporate lobbyists than a mild tax. You can’t just make lobbying a bit more expensive. You have to flush it out.
One way to free up legislators from corporate interests is term limits. Right now legislators spend decades in DC trying to stay in power. With term limits you would be free to vote on behalf of your constituents because you are returning home soon anyway. 
The citizens of this country need to become our most powerful lobbyists. Voting is not enough to hold legislators to task because of incumbency and the two-party duopoly - the voice of the people is now drowned out by corporate money and interests. That is what we must reverse.
A mild tax would just make lobbying slightly more expensive. You would either need to make the tax greater than 100,000% - or 1,000x - or prohibit lobbying entirely. Or you could flood the system with people-powered money and tie legislators to the public. 
A tax on lobbying is interesting - but if the return on lobbying is somewhere between 22,000% and 100,000% as it has been estimated to be then a tax of 35-75% will do next to nothing. 
 Thank you - and great seeing you!!  😀👍

One should pay equal attention to how the resources are spent. To me, the best use of resources would be to put them directly into citizens’ hands where it will do the most good.  👍
Other countries have approached remedying the concentration of wealth through a value-added tax that taxes those who benefit most from and consume the most in our society. It is proven and it works.
Third, we would likely see significant capital flight. If you are worth $500 million would you spend $10 million a year and submit to an annual audit to maintain US citizenship? Or would you become a citizen elsewhere? That is not an easy question to answer.
Second, many of the truly wealthy would take giant steps to avoid an annual inventory of their assets to the government.  This would include even adjusting their marital status and/or legal guardianship to divide assets among family members to fall below taxable thresholds.
First, in many cases it’s hard to come to a proper value of assets. Intellectual property, goodwill, illiquid family businesses, and speculative investments may be tough to find comparables for.
I understand the spirit and appeal of a wealth tax. It makes sense that those who enjoy vast fortunes should pay back into the system, particularly given the concentrations of wealth in our winner-take-all economy. But the implementation would be impractical and problematic.
 Determining how much very rich families would owe under Senator Warren’s tax plan would be devilishly difficult, the e…

 Looking forward to this 👍 
I will never forget what it’s like to be the odd man - or boy - out.  It’s too deep.
If impeachment isn’t successful my plan is to beat Donald Trump at the ballot box in 2020.  👍💪🇺🇸
Still I agree that moving forward is for the best. It will enable a more thorough investigation that may unearth new details. And it is an appropriate use of Congressional authority as established in the Constitution. Sometimes you do the right thing independent of politics.
A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.
Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward. Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.
The power bar is back!  We have a $1.5 million goal by September 30 - help us hit it!   👍💪🇺🇸
Congrats on making the October debate!  You earned it.  See you in Ohio.  👍😀🇺🇸

I understand those who have another point of view on this. Obviously the folks at NBC are the real decision-makers. But if I can forgive Shane, as the guy he called a slur, I hope others can as well. I also hope Shane is open to learning. We are all human, we’re all fallible.  👍
I think we have, as a society, become excessively punitive and vindictive concerning people’s statements and expressions we disagree with or find offensive. I don’t think people should be losing jobs unless it’s truly beyond the pale and egregious.
But I took the time to watch and listen to Shane’s work. He does not strike me as malignant or evil. He strikes me as a still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania who made some terrible and insensitive jokes and comments.
It’s also the case that anti-Asian racism is particularly virulent because it’s somehow considered more acceptable. If Shane had used the n word the treatment would likely be immediate and clear.
I’ve been called chink and gook any number of times in my life. It can be extraordinarily hurtful to feel like you are somehow not part of the only country you have ever known. I have certainly felt that - the churning sense of alienation, anger and marginalization.
 Thanks Eugene. I believe that people can find out about each other through this kind of dialogue. We should try to make this a teaching moment if possible. I understand and appreciate your perspective though, as there is a line to be drawn. 🙏👍

"Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA? We all know, everyone on this stage knows, that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests." 
How long do you think until we talk about the future of work? 
We can't trust on trade.  
Trump says build a wall, I'm going to say to Immigrants come to America because if you come here your son or daughter can run for president.  
Immigrants have been and continue to be an asset to our country.

Team USA Basketball not winning the gold medal is disappointing but not surprising. The rest of the world is catching up in talent and other national teams have higher levels of continuity. Hats off to the players who are repping the US - they are doing it the right way. 👍💪🇺🇸

I like to solve problems - and many of the biggest problems of this time need our government to be part of the solution.
Today is  - a day to embrace that we all struggle and that suicide and depression are silent killers that affect us all. Acknowledging them is not a sign of weakness but of strength. Everyone is loved and everyone has value, and everyone needs reminders.
A robot tax is an appealing idea but very difficult to administer. Is an IPad at a CVS a robot? How about software that eliminates a call center worker? A better way is to tax value transfers which captures the gains of automation in different contexts.

The automation of our labor is a lot like climate change - easy to ignore at first, but already having calamitous effects and set to accelerate.
Mets fans are used to heartbreak.
Glad that Hong Kong has pulled back the extradition bill that catalyzed the protests - that’s a big victory for the people.
None of it would be possible without your belief and support.  I still appreciate it just like in the early days.  Whenever someone tells me they support me it still feels unreal.  I will make the most of it.  🥊🙏😎
But these days are better in terms of the scope of what we can accomplish.  I’m more focused on things that can move the needle for the entire country.  We’ve already reached millions of people.  And we will reach millions more.
I remember the early days when I would scan each individual donation.   I’d tell myself a story about each donor based on what info was available. Sometimes I’d reach out. I miss those days in some ways.
These are heady days for the campaign - we are on track to more than DOUBLE our fundraising total from last quarter.  Thank you   You all are the new force for change in American politics.  😀💪🇺🇸
 The point is what is plausible is subject to change.  Best to keep an open mind and avoid making judgments until then.  👍
 For the record if you were to rewind four months you would have said I had no plausible path to the top 6 or the Fall debate stage. Yet many people - many journalists- used their heads and did their job. And here we are.
 My chances are actually based on the number of people voting for me in a number of months - which is an awfully difficult thing to project accurately.  Until then the job of the press is to report the news as they see it - and this campaign seems awfully newsworthy.  👍💪
Great move in the right direction by Walmart. Now for Congress to show it can be just as responsive and pass gun safety laws supported by the vast majority of Americans. 
Many Americans are underbanked and rely upon payday lenders, particularly in rural areas. If we made basic banking services available through the post office we would cut fees for consumers around the country.

Millions of Americans are going to tune into the debate on September 12th.  Thousands will say, “That guy is still here?”  Yes I am.  I’ll be here all the way to the White House.  😀
Some have called me pessimistic. Some even nihilistic. I would call myself something new - a believer in cash to improve people’s lives.  
It would probably be better for to report on Hurricane Dorian and the actual effects of climate change rather than having us talk about climate change.  We can always reschedule while Mother Nature is on her own timeline.

Imagining that people are infinitely adaptable is a waste of time. We need to start valuing people intrinsically and provide a path forward such that losing your job is a setback or inconvenience not an existential crisis.
Most of the tragedies will be unreported. Men quietly going home and drinking themselves to death. But occasionally there will be something externalized. Applied across a group of hundreds of thousands you would expect a wide range of outcomes including some that are unthinkable.
If you take a population of 3.5 million truckers, 94% of whom are men, average age 49, tens of thousands of whom are ex-military making average $46,000+ per year, losing their jobs will produce a range of reactions, some of which are likely to be tragic in consequence.
Oh no. There will be many displaced truckers in the days ahead. Tens of thousands are ex-military.   
 I like the verb ‘upending’ 👍

Today only 7% of private sector employees are in a union. Not coincidentally, worker benefits and compensation are harder to come by for most Americans. We should provide benefits like health care and retirement savings incentives independent of employment.
Happy Labor Day! Labor Day became a federal holiday in 1894 in response to mass riots and strikes that agitated for workers rights during the Industrial Revolution. It was meant to recognize worker rights. Today unions represent the lowest percentage of US workers in decades.

USA Basketball being available only on ESPN+ is highly disappointing.  Highlights only for most of us.
When you start with an employer with a job they are looking to fill, job training programs can work. It’s when you have a school operating in a vacuum that you see problems. 
We are the only country that struggles with gun violence at this level.  Other countries respond to tragedy.  We must as well.  Our people deserve better than to live in fear and be struck down at random.  We are better than this.  We will do better for our kids.
The Odessa shooting is horrific - people shot randomly in a shopping center for no reason. My heart goes out to the families of the dead and wounded, including our brave law enforcement officers. We must do all we can to curb the scourge of gun violence in this country.
One reason DC seems like it’s always years behind the curve is that legislators get there and stay there for decades.  A 12-year term limit would align lawmakers’ incentives with the American people and speed up the adoption of new ideas.

Many politicians are essentially saying “I’ll make companies do less bad stuff.”  That’s helpful in some ways but falls short of what the vision should be: “Let us, the people, do more of what we value for ourselves.”
An entrepreneur said to me “We are using our people for revenue instead of the opposite.”  He’s right.
FEMA should be separated from the Department of Homeland Security and bolstered to combat the worst effects of climate change.  It should not be sharing money with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This country pays a lot of attention to its outliers. We should be paying more attention to the normal person.
I’m a fan of a higher minimum wage - no one should be working full-time and be poor in this country. I prefer a dividend though because 1) it recognizes parenting and other caregiving work and 2) it supports small businesses rather than increasing their costs. It’s a better path.

Which is more unlikely - 1) going from being a complete unknown to 6th in the polls or 2) going from 6th in the polls to winning the whole thing?

One thing I like about politics - it all comes down to the people.  If you have the right people on your side you win.

You know what would be a great idea - a global climate change mitigation force. Countries would contribute according to their GDP.  There are a lot of issues out there in places that don’t fall neatly in any one country’s territory.
Technically there is no official dress code for the debates.  😀

 Bernie ignores the facts that money in our hands would 1) create hundreds of thousands of local jobs and 2) recognize and reward the nurturing work being done in our homes and communities every day.  He also assumes that everyone wants to work for the government which isn’t true.

The fact is most Americans are still just tuning in to the 2020 primary.  Anyone who thinks the current standings in the polls will hold true through February hasn’t paid attention to what happened in past cycles. The  surge yet lies ahead of us.  😀👍💪

Primary challengers to Donald Trump on the Republican side are a very good thing.  Would love to see a real heavyweight take a risk on it.  would be awesome.
Americans don’t get each other.  One way to change this - a program that sends high school seniors to visit and work in other parts of the country.  They would come back with a different perspective and some new friends.  👍🇺🇸  
Haha you all are the best.  Confession - I  quite often.  😀   
Reminds me a little bit of politics - most campaign teams have to come together pretty quickly. Though you’re seldom competing against teams that have been together a long time. And if someone has done it a bunch of times their experience can be both an asset and a liability.
I wouldn’t be surprised if this USA basketball team drops another game or two - it’s hard to come together in a few weeks and win against teams that have been together for years. The talent gap is not what it once was either.
Fireworks in the summer in New Hampshire 👍🇺🇸🎉 
Wow Andrew Luck retiring.  It’s so rare that someone reaches the highest levels of performance and competition and then steps away in their prime.  Good for him and his family.  Though I wouldn’t be surprised if we see him again.

Oh no.  RBG is a boss.  Stay strong.
We are staffing up in the early states and starting to build field operations in key areas. We are picking up people who are excited about what we can achieve. This campaign is growing at the best possible time.
Incredible volunteers have already made more than 20,000 phone calls to early states - thank you   That’s the kind of passion and energy that will lead us all the way to the White House.  😀🥊🎉
We can totally do this. We have been at 4 and 5% in early state polls and at 3% nationwide. The shrinking field and the Fall debates should give us an extra boost too.  😀💪🚀
Looks like making the November debates will be based on polling   calling and working on the early states will be key.  👍🇺🇸
Gerrymandering is a disaster for our democracy. It skews our policies and our legislators’ incentives and makes more elections foregone conclusions. We need to empower independent redistricting commissions to draw lines using objective standards.

There are many things we can do to improve our democracy - the most obvious is to automatically register voters when they turn 18.  Other countries have done this and seen increases in their voting rates.  
We live in the most prosperous economy in the history of the world; it is unconscionable that some senior citizens still struggle to survive. The Freedom Dividend would help our elders enjoy the basic economic dignity they deserve. 
If we are to fight climate change, we need to find a way to harness market incentives to ensure that polluters internalize the costs of emissions. A carbon fee and dividend will do just that while encouraging companies to seek innovative solutions to minimize pollution. 
 Thanks Justin!  👍💪
Hope they remember this summer in New Hampshire 👍🇺🇸 
 Yup 👍

Breakfast of champions 💪 
Every journalist should get in the habit of asking every politician “What are your thoughts on the right responses to the 4th Industrial Revolution?” This would be a step in the right direction.
The imbalances are going to get much worse with the arrival of new technologies. Journalists and politicians should be laser-focused on these problems and real solutions. The 4th Industrial Revolution is the greatest economic transformation in history and it is picking up steam.
When a $20 trillion+ economy stops working for people and the winner-take-all dynamics grow you need big moves to rebalance. In that context a Freedom Dividend of $1,000/month is one of the few moves that will put buying power into people’s hands and rebuild the middle class.
I’m not the only one who has looked at the numbers and concluded that the economy has stopped working for most people. Ray Dalio says we need to declare a national emergency. Jamie Dimon says we need a Marshall Plan to rebuild the US and a negative income tax. The data is clear.
You know how you can tell who might drop out - whoever seems to be enjoying themselves the least.

This country simply follows the almighty dollar. The best solution is to put more dollars into more people’s hands to get the economy and society working for more of us.
Immigrants contribute massively to our economy. Scapegoating them for the problems of automation misses the point. We need to solve the real problems and create a path forward for all Americans in the 21st Century Economy. 
Even our politicians have been brainwashed into thinking that economic value and human value are the same thing. They are not. Pretending or thinking that they are will lead us to ruin in an age when technology will be capable of more and more.
I get the sense they don’t trust people.  That’s a mistake.  People are our best hope.
It’s strange that politicians who claim to want to help people overlook the most direct solution - give people money.
Food service and preparation is the 3rd biggest job category in the US.

The future of fast food - no cashiers and no seating means no cleaning 
Only half of Americans own stock and the bottom 80% own only 8% of stock market wealth. The stock market in particular is a terrible proxy for American well-being.
Donald Trump seems to be betting his presidency on continued economic strength and stock market prices. That’s unwise on several levels. If the President could control economic growth we would never have a recession.

Now that William Morris Endeavor is going public we may get a sense of just how exploitative the numbers are. If I were ESPN paying hundreds in millions in broadcast rights I’d want more than 10 percent of it to go to fighters.
Any journalist reading this - dig into the story. You will find an American hero who was fired for doing what’s right. And you know who helped make it happen? 
Every other major sport has a union - NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL.  Players get 47 - 51 percent of revenue. In the UFC it’s closer to 10 percent. The sport is tougher and more dangerous too. I will empower the fighters as President.
The techies are among the most concerned about what is coming. They see it every day. They are working on it.

Just got a phone call from a number that looked just like mine - it was a robocall. I’m going to ban robocalls as President. We have better things to do than have our time wasted. I remember being glad when my phone rang. Times have changed.

Student loan debt has exploded over the last decade. We should reduce the financial burden of education by ensuring that the federal government does not profit from these loans and by forgiving much of the debt of graduates.

Americans don't care about political theater, they care about why they keep working harder and harder without getting ahead. It's vital that we address that issue, the root cause of why Donald Trump was elected. 
As president, I'll match China's spending on computing resources instead of focusing on harmful trade wars. We need to be able to keep up with their developments in AI.

 doctors are fighting for their first union contract. Interns and doctors need fair treatment and conditions in order to take proper care of their patients. Right now we often push residents in particular too far.  
Data is now more valuable than oil. The data we generate gets monetized in myriad ways while we are increasingly subject to advertising and see none of the value ourselves. I would establish data as a property right for us to share in its use and value.

I was in a shipping container apartment in Las Vegas that cost only $30,000 and was downright appealing.  There are things we can do to make housing more affordable for many Americans.
Housing costs and rent are going up for more and more Americans while income stagnates. Relaxing zoning laws and NIMBYism would help in many areas as would micro-apartments and innovative approaches to communal housing.

Taking the most prominent prisoner in the country off of suicide watch 6 days after an attempt seems like a truly bizarre decision.

I don’t expect people to agree with me on everything- that would be odd. My main hope is that people trust that I’m trying to solve problems and I’m open to different approaches - particularly if the data drives in a particular direction. Changing one’s mind is not a bad thing.

The IRS should automatically fill out our tax returns - it would be simple for the gov’t to figure out most people’s taxes based on previous years and publicly available information. We could just sign off and modify as needed. We have better things to do.

We should also emphasize technical training, apprenticeships and vocational tracks. College is not the answer for many Americans.

The language our leaders use carries great weight. When they use dehumanizing language they normalize hate, and people can be encouraged to do terrible things. I will never use such language as your president; we must improve our rhetoric to combat hate.

The Freedom Dividend is far more than just extra money. It's a source of dignity, stability, and well-being in a changing economy. 
Gun violence is a scourge on this nation. Universal background checks and red flag laws are common sense steps toward keeping our citizens safe.

One of the more promising approaches is to ‘reforest’ the ocean by setting up algae and kelp arrays that could spur marine life. We have to be proactive and invest.

In the Atlantic Ocean, satellite imagery is detecting a 4 to 8 percent annual decrease in biological activity, a number that exceeds existing global warming models. That is catastrophic. Reversing these trends will take mammoth ingenuity and investment.

 I was in the room Michael. You have bigger problems than fond memories of your pretend run. Good luck with them.
We must do more to combat gun violence and hate in America. In addition to gun safety laws we need to prioritize domestic terrorism, make it harder for hateful ideas to spread, help victims of hate and strengthen our families and schools. 
 Even the inventor of GDP Simon Kuznets said it was a terrible measure of national well-being and we shouldn’t use it as that. That was nearly a hundred years ago. It’s well past time for an upgrade.
 The problem with current economic models is they treat us all as inputs into a system. The system should be trying to optimize for our well-being.  When GDP and life expectancy are going in opposite directions you know the measures are leading us in the wrong direction.
 What we need is a new economic vision that revolves around our own well-being. Instead of GDP and capital efficiency, we should use our own health, mental health, childhood success rates, freedom from addiction and environmental quality as the new measures of economic progress.

How much was Zion worth to the NCAA and their partners last year?  Tens of millions.

Domestic terrorism has killed more Americans in the past decade than any other form. It is long past time for common-sense gun reform and a federal domestic terrorism statute. Most importantly, we must come together as a nation and prove that there is no place for hate in the US. 
It's too easy for these debates to become little more than political theater and entertainment.  I'll make sure to stay laser-focused on the issues at each debate you send me to.  Looking forward to many more!

Upgrading our power grid to a new intelligent grid that could dynamically monitor and change energy flows would cost up to $480 billion - but it would save us up to $2 trillion over 20 years and reduce CO2 emissions by 2 gigatons a year by 2050. Would also create plenty of jobs.

I’ve been too busy this summer for movies - but it seems that this summer’s movies were a real dud. I hope some real creativity and originality returns at some point.
Last week, the DNC declared one of our qualifying polls as invalid, but we know that it's only a matter of time before we hit that next poll. Until then, enjoy BOGO longer-than-long-shot-glasses, so you and a friend can celebrate when the time is right.  
If we update our economic measurements to reflect the things Americans actually care about, then we can align corporations' profit incentives with improving our citizens' health and well-being.

We need a clear federal domestic terrorism statute. The majority of terrorism deaths in the past ten years have been the result of domestic terrorism. A proper statute would help law enforcement and the FBI investigate and utilize appropriate resources.
Let’s beat Donald Trump.
And hours later another mass shooting this time in Dayton, Ohio - the death toll could have been much higher. Enough is enough. We need common sense gun laws. We owe it to ourselves, our children and the countless Americans impacted by gun violence to get this right.
I deserve a cameo 😀 
The Internet is more powerful at spreading hateful and toxic messages and ideas than positive ones. How to counteract this is one of the foremost challenges of the 21st century.
It looks like this was a hate crime. We should focus the attention of the FBI and law enforcement on hate groups.  These ideas have no place in America. Hate kills, love saves.
Wow 600,000 friends on Twitter up from only 50,000 at the beginning of 2019.  It only matters if we do something with it  🥊👍🇺🇸
We also need a national mental health initiative. When people - young men in particular - are set to self-destruct there are often signs that go ignored and unaddressed. Millions are suffering from mental illnesses and there is so much more we can do for each other.

Oh no. My heart goes out to the families and individuals impacted by the El Paso shooting. We owe them and all Americans common sense gun safety laws. Other societies respond to senseless tragedies - we must do the same. We are better than this.

I call it the Trickle Up Economy - from people, families and communities up. It’s good for businesses obviously but more importantly it’s good for us. It would make us stronger, healthier, mentally healthier, more productive, more creative and more generous.
One study said that alleviating poverty would increase our GDP by $700 billion based just on better health and education outcomes. That doesn’t include the massive increases in entrepreneurship and creativity. Investing in ourselves is the best investment we could make.
Most of the money would stay right in our economy anyway - go to car repairs, daycare, little league signups, etc and create 2 million jobs in our local communities. It’s not like the money disappears - instead it is spent in the most impactful ways possible.
The biggest lie in America today is that we don’t have the money. We bailed the banks out for $4 trillion and gave big companies a $1.5 trillion tax cut. Our GDP is $20+ trillion up $5 trillion in 12 years. We are the richest society in history and can easily afford a dividend.
GDP is an old and incomplete measure. If our life expectancy is declining because of suicides, drug overdoses and stress, who cares how much we're producing? We need to make our well-being the measurement of our progress.

 $1,000/month is not an adaptation plan. It is however a good idea on top of an adaptation plan to help make families and communities more resilient. If you were a poor American in a flood plain you would not want your future to rest on our ability to reverse climate change.
 Hey Robinson - I’m passionate about addressing climate change. It’s an existential threat to our way of life.  We need to do everything under the sun to respond. That to me includes making our communities more resilient. Please don’t mistake my concern as a desire not to act. 👍
 Thank you!  😀👍

The fact that his work is necessary in America is distressing and appalling.
Visiting Pastor Bobby and the Mission of Hope dispensing water in Flint - truly inspiring. Need more servant leaders like him. To support his work   👍🇺🇸🙏 
 grading on a curve 😀👍
It’s not just Flint - there are thousands of communities that are dealing with water quality and safety issues in South Carolina, Ohio and all parts of the country.  We have to get this right for all Americans.
On the way to Flint - imagine not being able to trust your water supply and having your kids poisoned.   Unconscionable and an emblem of how far behind we are in 2019 at getting the basics right for our people.
Lesson  of running for President:  Quality luggage is worth the investment.

Democrats fighting each other might make for good TV, but it's a distraction from the real issues. We need to solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected instead of playing into his hands.  
Hey  I just stepped off the stage in Detroit, and wow, what a fantastic night. I hope I made you proud, I think the Yang Gang is about to get a lot bigger. If you can, please make a donation tonight, and then head out to celebrate this win!

I have already signed the pledge to end the forever wars. As President, I would bring the troops home, deescalate tensions with Iran, and I would start investing our resources in our own communities.  
We’ve fallen apart at home, so we’ve elected Donald Trump and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies. What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problems right here at home.
What we have to do is give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses, and the best way to do this by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands.  
The way we win this election is by redefining economic progress to include all the things that matter to us, like our own health, our well-being, our clean air and clean water, and how our kids are doing. 
How do we beat Trump? We bring together people of every political ideology and focus on building an economy that works for all of us regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum. That's what I'm doing, and that's why I'll win this election.  
 Ok, I’ll say it: You were right,  -your pick to click-is having a good night.
Martin Luther King believed that the most genuine way to address racial inequality in the United States was through universal basic income. I couldn't agree more.  
We need to take dramatic steps to remedy the damage that we're doing to our planet, but we also need to prepare for the consequences of the damage we cannot undo, and the damage done by other countries.   
I'm the best candidate to heal the racial divide in America because civil rights hero MLK believed that the most genuine way to address racial inequality in the United States was through universal basic income, and I'm the only candidate on this stage proposing one.  
Our criminal justice system should be data driven and solution driven, not profit driven.   
I’ve done the MATH. In 2014, immigrants paid over $328 billion in taxes. Scapegoating them for problems they have nothing to do with and ignoring their upside is ripping us apart and distracting us from the real issues plaguing the American people. 
A corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me, “We should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when they’re behind bars.” We think we’re saving money, but we just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways. 
Our current healthcare system is a massive hinderance on our nation's entrepreneurship. The burden of keeping America healthy shouldn't be on business owners or individuals, but our government.  
If you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants, you will find wall-to-wall robots and machines.  
Immigrants do amazing and important things in this country. They pay taxes, they work hard, and they're members of our communities. These are the stories we should be telling.  
 Andrew Yang: "If you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants, you will find wall-to-w…
My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 US patents for GE and IBM. I think that’s a pretty good deal for the United States. That’s the immigration story we should be telling. 
If we say "Look, we're going to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families", we'll watch both businesses and families recover and bloom. That's the argument we should be making to the American people.  
 Andrew Yang gives a superb answer on medicare for all, framing it as a massive positive thing for businesses and business…
When I told my wife I was going to run for President, the first thing she asked was "what are we going to do about healthcare?" That's a true story and a real problem  
The word "automation" doesn't come up in the DNC debates unless I say it. Let's get our priorities straight and talk about what we're going to do when half of all US jobs are automated away.  
We need to do the opposite of what we're doing right now, and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. I've done the math, and that's why I want to give every American adult $1000 a month.  
It may sound like a gimmick, but UBI is an idea that's been championed by great American thinkers of all political persuasions for centuries. Today, it is more than an idea, it's the solution to the fundamental problems of the 21st century. That's why I'm running for President. 
We've already automated away millions of jobs over the last decade, and with new developments in AI, yours could be next. These jobs won't come back. Don’t believe me? Ask any autoworker in Detroit.

What would you do with an extra $1000 a month? 
Well that’s it for the debate! Tune in tomorrow for the next episode of “Who Will Run Our Country?”
Only 33% of Americans go to college. We should focus on plans that help Americans who pursue all different paths, like the  of $1,000 a month.
The greatest downside of being in the debate tomorrow night is that I won’t get to live tweet it.
We should also be honest that automation is responsible for 80% of the jobs being lost in manufacturing.  It’s not trade or globalization that are driving the changes.  If you go to a factory or Amazon fulfillment center you will see wall-to-wall robots.
We should be honest that government-funded retraining of workers doesn’t work. The success rates for the manufacturing workers of the Midwest were 0-15%.  Almost half left the workforce.
Whoops spoke too soon.  reading my Twitter.  😀
They are not talking much about race tonight.  I wonder why.  
I hate to say it but most of the green manufacturing jobs will go to robots.
So far it feels like everyone is doing about what you would expect.

One reason why the  has bipartisan support is that it is both humane and fiscally efficient. Milton Friedman, one of the fathers of modern capitalism, championed Universal Basic Income for this reason. 
It’s not just Flint.  Towns in South Carolina and Ohio have water quality issues.  We need to rebuild our decaying infrastructure as soon as possible and get people clean water in the meantime.  Poisoning children is unacceptable.
On the way back to Detroit!  Been coming every year since 2010.  It’s come a long way since the bankruptcy - but there is still a lot of work to be done.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Access to clean water is such a basic human right and should be a given in the richest country in the history of the world. When I'm President, I'll make sure the water in places like Flint, Michigan is clean enough that my kids could drink it.

Journalism, particularly local journalism, is absolutely crucial for holding government accountable and a functioning democracy. I would protect this vital institution through a Local Journalism Fund, which would help local media outlets adapt to the 21st Century economy. 
In America only 6% of high school students are on a technical or vocational track. In Germany it is 59%. We should massively invest in apprenticeships and vocational programs as they will lead to resilient opportunities for millions of Americans.

The skills and experience that our veterans gain during their service should be applicable to their employment when they return to civilian life. Starting them back off at 0 in the job market after years of training is wasteful and disrespectful.

Anyone with the last name Yang should just say “Yeah he’s my cousin.”
I can’t remember a team with less direction. If you’re developing young players you use your cap space for assets and let them play. You don’t use it on role players for 1 year when there are limited free agents the following year. It’s the strangest thing I’ve ever seen.

American retirees deserve every penny of Social Security benefits they earned. They also deserve $1000 a month for being a shareholder of the wealthiest nation in history. This will make sure that seniors can actually retire with dignity. 
Puerto Rico needs new leadership and a path forward in rebuilding. Forgiving its debt is the right thing to do, as is statehood if that is the will of the Puerto Rican people. Rebuilding the island should be a national imperative.

Our vets deserve to be healthy and valued when they come back from service. That's why I launched my new policy, More Than a Handshake, an initiative to support and strengthen America's veterans here at home.   
Marijuana is already legal in most states for medical use and in many for recreation. It's time to end the ambiguity and legalize it at the federal level. This would improve safety, social equity, and generate billions of dollars in new revenue based on legal cannabis businesses. 
This is going to sound odd coming from someone running for President but I think we pay too much attention to what is going on with the President. We know who he is. If he verifies it for the 1000th time it should be considered barely newsworthy.

Americans are moving across state lines at multi-decade lows. This is bad for our labor market and for people who are seeking new opportunities. We should make it easier to move by reimbursing work-related moving expenses and easing licensing by state.  
Serving our country can be an amazing experience, but also an incredible sacrifice. Our vets deserve more than our appreciation and a handshake when they return home and reenter civilian life. 
We have more in common than not. 
The economy was not a top 5 discussion topic in the last DNC debate. Our winner-take-all economy has dramatic effects that ripple throughout our society - we are in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We must make this the center of the national conversation. 
We should also revive the Office of Technology Assessment so that Congress has its own set of technical experts to turn to for guidance. We are decades behind on these issues and they threaten to undermine our democracy, depress our children and transform our way of life.
The FTC settlement with Facebook is the latest sign that we need a new Department of the Attention Economy to focus solely on regulating the digital economy. I would also appoint a Secretary of Technology in the Cabinet to address tech issues before they become full-blown crises.
Financial literacy. Communication and relationships. Positive psychology and healthy use of technology. Teaching these subjects in our high schools will both keep kids engaged and better prepare them for the future.

We have set a date for an AMA with our Reddit Basecamp! Tune in with your burning questions on Wednesday morning  
Our economy is transforming in ways that are pushing more and more Americans to the sidelines. People are blaming themselves when it’s not their fault. We need to evolve and build an economy that works for people. 
 Thanks Rutger - took that from your TED talk.  Was there.  👍 Thank you for opening so many hearts and minds.  🙏😀

It would also make car repairs an irritation rather than a catastrophe, give parents more time with their children, spur arts, creativity and entrepreneurship, and have myriad other positive effects on our way of life.
Studies have shown that not being able to pay your bills consumes bandwidth and reduces functional IQ by 13 points - almost one standard deviation. The  would make us more rational, reasonable, optimistic, generous and more able to solve problems.
A mindset of scarcity is pervasive in a country where 78% are living paycheck-to-paycheck and half of us can’t afford an unexpected $500 bill. If you change that reality you have a chance to reverse the mindset of scarcity that polarizes us and puts us against each other.
I can't fathom a country that is enjoying unprecedented wealth and at the same time, its elders are unable to retire with dignity and struggle to survive. This is why the  would supplement seniors' hard-earned Social Security benefits. 
What is making things worse in America is a mindset of scarcity - if someone else is doing well then I’m somehow losing out. The antidote is a mindset of abundance - if you are doing well that’s great for me too. The question is how to generate an abundance mindset in more of us.
 Great meeting you too!  😀👍🙏

 You know it Ryan 😀👍
It’s quite hot here in Iowa.  Good thing I wear a jacket and trousers.
I think this summer may hammer the point home - most of the country has a heat advisory in effect.  
Climate change is much too benign sounding - we need to rebrand it to “climate crisis” or “global warming” or “climate catastrophe” to convey the severity of the situation we are in.
AI joke: “How far behind the US is China in AI research?”  Answer: “12 hours.”  Now they might be ahead not behind.
 Thank you Kara - great spending time with you!  😀👍

 I love it!  😀👍
 I don't make memes or gifs but I can cross stitch. Hope  likes this☺️    
If I was there would be constant shots of my face being like “I will let you two hash this out.”
Glad I’m not standing in-between Joe and Kamala.
July 31st is debate night!  Nice placement.  😀👍 
Just because I come from the business world doesn't mean I have anything else in common with the current POTUS.  Trump was a phony entrepreneur and is a bad president. Real entrepreneurs build strong teams. 
Thanks for having me on.  👍 
America is fantastic at letting market incentives dominate - but our current problems aren’t market-based problems. There is no market-based solution to fighting climate change or reintegrating society - unless we create them and change the rules.
 that’s 3 pm Central 😀👍
We should reform our laws on what constitutes excessive force - Eric Garner should be alive today.  At the least we can honor his memory by changing our broken system of evaluating police behavior.  
I am pumped for the next round of debates, and I want you to come with me!  Sign up to be entered for a chance to win a trip for 2 to the July debates in Detroit!   
Here is something you never hear when a company pays a dividend: “What are the shareholders going to do with the money?” “How do we know they’ll do something good with it?” We are the owners and shareholders of this society. A  would improve our lives each day.

On the way to Des Moines for some campaigning - see you soon Iowa!
Watching Trump continue to try to bully people for political mileage is disgusting.  I can’t wait to relegate him to the dustbin of history.
South Carolina Jermaine Johnson is the man!  😀👍🇺🇸 
This is what $1,000 looks like.  Imagine getting it once a month. We can make the  real for every American.  👍🇺🇸 
Coincidentally heading to Iowa tomorrow.  👍
This is deeply messed up. 2Pac is awesome and expressing one’s humanity should be a good thing. 
Freaking global warming.
Just heard that we are rescheduling the Philly rally due to a heat wave that is advising people to stay someplace cool.   and safety first. Will reschedule and be there soon!!  😀🙏
When we talk about healthcare, people often ask "where are we going to get the money?” We are already spending more than enough money, we just need to make sure it's being spent more effectively. 
Ooh I’m Tier 2 for being Top 10 in polling!  😀👍🇺🇸 Nice! 
 this will make my poker playing friends sad
Looking forward to Detroit!  😀👍🇺🇸 
 Thanks 👍🇺🇸
 Silicon Valley has found its presidential candidate in Andrew Yang 
I am a huge fan of Raj Chetty’s research and cite it frequently (e.g. an American born in the 90s has a 50% chance of doing better than his/her parents). The remedies to the problems he identifies seem both big and obvious to me - give more people money. 
The idea of a Universal Basic Income has been around for a long time and has received bipartisan support. In the wake of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we need it right now. That's why I'm proposing a  of $1000/month for every American adult. 
 ‘This would be tremendous for America … this is not as radical as you might think’ — explains why he’s spearhe…
We are in 6th place and polling at 5% in NH!  😀👍 
The candidate who wins in 2020 may simply be the candidate who makes following politics less exhausting.
 Candidate doing better than many veteran politicians in first White House run.via 
They didn’t see us coming. They will doubt us at every turn. And when we win they will be left wondering how it happened.
 Thank you!!
Thank you Nikki!  😀👍🙏 
 Thank you!!  😀👍🇺🇸
 My car got a butt job.    🇺🇸🦅 
Happy to sign a pledge not to take money from defense contractors - we need to end the forever wars.  👍🇺🇸🙏 
The  would be a game changer for millions of Americans. It's easy to think about policies in the abstract, but when you get to see the profound, concrete effects of one, it really reminds you what you're fighting for. 
I have met with several veteran groups and one vet told me something profound. “It’s not that employers just aren’t pro-veteran. They are actually looking for reasons to say no and rule you out because they think you’re damaged goods.”  We need to do much more for our veterans.
We need to rewrite the rules so that trillion dollar tech companies aren't paying less in taxes than the average American. If we put a mechanism in place where we all benefit from new innovations we can easily afford a dividend of $1,000 a month. 
One thing I’ve discovered through this campaign - there are many people who see things the same way that I do. It’s just that none of us has been in position to run for President.
 Thanks Steve!

There are times when new technology seems a bit like magic. We need to take the good aspects and amplify them while acknowledging that there are going to be many unintended consequences that we need to own and address too.
Looking back on our Q2 donations, I am extremely touched that we raised as much money as we did with so many small donations.  Our campaign is built on a strong foundation of grassroots support.  Have you made your first small donation of Q3 yet?   
5% in New Hampshire and rising fast!   thanks 👍😀🇺🇸
Thank you for being such an awesome role model - it’s Dads like you who will help make paid family leave a reality in the US.  👍🇺🇸
Our criminal justice system needs an overhaul. I’d get rid of private prisons and cash bail practices that systematically target poor folks. It shouldn’t be a crime to be poor in this country. 
We need a president who is focused on uniting Americans to solve the problems facing our nation, not making hateful comments that separate and divide Americans. 
Automation of low-end jobs makes them even more punishing 
Trust is one of the most vital aspects of a society.  If you lose it, it's hard to get it back. 
Running for President is both less human and more human than you’d think. Less human because you spend a lot of time chasing media coverage and $$. More human because you have awesome supporters with incredible stories all over the country.  👍😀 
The level to which police ignore or minimize violence against women is staggering 
As the son of immigrants I’ve been told to go back where I came from several times. When I was young it hurt. Now it seems absurd. We are all American.  👍🇺🇸

 Thanks Caleb great to meet you!  😀👍
In 7th place according to combo of polls 
AI will bring fundamental transformation in relationships, economics and geopolitics 
Starting a business without stable economic footing is near impossible.  It's no wonder we've seen more businesses close than open in most of the country in recent years.  By putting money into our hands more small businesses will grow. 
 Thank you for being here!  😀👍🇺🇸
 A beautiful day with  in  My first political rally. Thank you 
Characterizing members of Congress as being from another country is part of the problem. We need to come together and stop putting up false barriers between different groups of people.
I’ve been through a blackout in NYC. It can be very frightening and dangerous. It’s just the latest sign of how much we need to invest in our infrastructure - not just for efficiency and sustainability but for our basic health and safety.
About 25% of Americans are considered politically disengaged.  If we activate enough of them we can win the whole election.
 Thank you!!  😀👍
 As promised, we waved around the signs and got some honks and cheers!  
Thanks 👍🥊
Looking good Portland   You all are incredible.  👍🇺🇸🥊 
Increasingly, there will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot can't do as well as, or better than, a human. We need to get real about the future of work, including Universal Basic Income in an era of unprecedented automation. 
Time with family is good for both us and the economy.  We should catch up to the rest of the world and have federally mandated paid family leave. 
One of the reasons my campaign has such strong grassroots support is that we are talking about real solutions to real problems that most Americans face.  It's hard to get excited about politics when you don't think it will make a difference in your day to day life. 
Millions of Americans lack access to inexpensive financial services. But every community has a post office. We can follow other countries and provide basic banking services through the post office - it would lower costs and give post offices a boost. 
I have many friends in Louisiana including - hope all remain safe and dry through Hurricane Barry. These storms are likely to become more and more common and powerful. We should invest in upgrading infrastructure and protecting our communities from climate change.
Just landed in Portland - see everyone Saturday!!   👍😀🇺🇸
Things you miss on the road. 
Way to win it  😀👍🥊
Our national parks and lands are bigger than politics.  We need to do everything in our power to preserve natural resources for the public and for posterity.  Take a hike. 
I find live action remakes of Aladdin, Lion King and other movies I grew up with a bit depressing. It’s like we can’t come up with new stories.
The only ones who win when communities bid against each other for corporate headquarters are the companies. We should end the practice - from a national perspective it doesn’t matter where the HQ is.

7,000+ retail locations are closing in the US in 2019  being a retail clerk is the most common job in the US. The average clerk is a 39 year old woman making $9-10 an hour.
As capitalism increasingly specializes, fewer and fewer people will be valued by the market. There is no justice in good people being left behind because a robot can do their job more efficiently. We, as a society, need to value people even if the market doesn't.

We have a winner!  Telling Malorie that she won the  was an amazing experience for me and my team.  It's a reminder of why we are running: to change the lives of millions of people like Malorie, for whom $1,000 a month will be a game changer.  👍🇺🇸 
Amazon committing $700 million to retraining workers is a sign of just how big the automation problem is 
 Half of Americans won’t have adequate retirement savings - the Freedom Dividend would help.
Another detail - only 12% of respondents feel confident they know who they will support.  This race is very early.  😀👍
Thank you for your support in Q2   We’re going to crush it in Q3.  👍🥊🇺🇸 
2% in NBC poll  one poll down 3 to go 😀👍

2% in latest NBC/WSJ poll good for 6th place  👍🇺🇸
One of the reasons why the  is for everyone is that it would create a trickle-up economy, in which local businesses are stimulated by an increase in consumption, which would circulate the money over and over again and create millions of jobs in the process. 
Thank you   You all are amazing!!!  This campaign is truly of the people - and we will change the course of history.  😀👍🙏 
Ranked Choice Voting would dramatically improve our democracy by letting voters express their true preferences and making it so no one is afraid to ‘waste their vote’  our politics would become more dynamic and representative.
Portland coming your way this weekend and can’t wait!  👍😀 
Financial insecurity has the effect of decreasing mental bandwidth - studies have shown that it reduces functional IQ by 13 points. Getting the economic existential stress off our minds would actually make us smarter, more rational and optimistic.

Retraining workers who are displaced by automation is great in theory, but the data suggest that in practice it doesn’t work — these retraining programs have a 0-15% success rate. Most people who think we can turn truck drivers into coders are neither. 
Also not a great sign that Washington DC is now the richest metro area in the country.

It may sound like science fiction, but automation is projected to replace 20 - 30% of all jobs in the next 10 years, including many of the 3.5 million truck drivers in the US. It is the most common job in 29 states. The transition could be a disaster if not managed properly. 
Washington DC has become a place to spend one’s career instead of a place to solve problems and go home. Term limits would transform the culture of Congress, free members up from the fundraising treadmill and introduce newer legislators with new ideas.  
Now that’s what I call grassroots!  😀👍  
I’m very fortunate. Let’s give more people a chance to say the same.
Artists have the same impact on a community as entrepreneurs. Creative arts account for 4.2% of GDP but have an outsized impact on community vitality and our quality of life. The Freedom Dividend would free up many Americans to pursue artistic aspirations. 
 Democrat Andrew Yang wants to end robocalls as president 
Martin Luther King and others have supported versions of the Freedom Dividend over the years - it’s an idea whose time has come. 👍🇺🇸 
People with dyslexia often make great entrepreneurs. Their struggles in school often drive them toward different approaches to solving problems and making connections.  Our neurodiversity should be celebrated not discouraged.

The purpose of economic progress should be our happiness and fulfillment 
If we mistake money for the worth of a person we are lost.
I say I ride my bicycle to work because it’s faster and better exercise - but the truth is it’s a lot more fun. 😀
Just met with a robotocist- he described how 96% of a warehouse fulfillment job has been automated leaving humans to do the remaining mind-numbing 4%. They often quit.  “If that’s the future of work we need a different one.”
This just in - I’m in this for the long haul.  I don’t have another position to run for.  This is the only one.  😀👍
Thanks for running and being such a great public servant  - you are only getting started my friend.  👍🇺🇸

Universal Basic Income seems like a radical idea until you realize that our winner-take-all economy is about to accelerate in unprecedented ways.  There are very few means to distribute the gains broadly and quickly to millions of Americans. It becomes common sense very quickly.
Iran’s incentives to adhere to the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement are limited if US economic sanctions are being imposed. I would re-enter negotiations with the existing agreement as a starting point. The goal should be to reduce tensions while moving our interests forward.

I grew up in the 80s in the heyday of shopping malls.  Now 30% are going to close in the next 4 years which will have a disastrous effect on local property values.  We should try to help malls transition to new uses wherever possible.

And my kicking a bottle cap is now one of our best-performing videos ever. Maybe next time I’ll break a board with my head.

With accelerating developments in technology and AI, capital efficiency and humanity will be increasingly at odds.  We need to bring capitalism into the 21st century and make our own well-being the goals of the economy. 
 Thanks 👍

Haha  accepted 
The truth is there are millions of Americans living in punishing circumstances that we can 100% afford to improve - we should be better than that too.
As a parent and American this treatment of migrant families does not represent our values  we are much better than this.
When experts refer to our time as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it's something we should take very seriously. History has taught us that industrial revolutions are messy, painful and disruptive. We must face this challenge head on. 
Someone said that supporting my campaign is the most fun they’ve had in ages.  That made me very happy.
Heard that could head to Asia if he doesn’t get a good NBA deal/offer that he’s excited about.
Also expensive.
The military is one of the most trusted institutions in American life. Politicizing it for a holiday celebration is a terrible precedent.

Space-based solar energy could be one way to get the clean energy we need 
For reference about 8 - 10 candidates are projected to make the Fall debates so the field will thin considerably  better for us if we make it which we will.  👍😀
 That’s the plan Barry. What’s interesting is that aside from Harris there hasn’t been much of a bump from the debates for other candidates. So the more we do up front the better.  👍

 Yes we have to reach the landline answering generation. Think about the folks you know who answer the phone and talk to pollsters. Or maybe they can pick up the phone just this once.  😀👍
Looks like Nevada is one of the early states that counts too.  👍😀
I will update this thread anytime we get an approved poll result and then we will celebrate the 4th one together.  😀👍🇺🇸
If there’s a key thing to do it’s to reach out to folks who get polled - particularly in the early states - and tell them to come out for Yang! Literally a few dozen poll responses could make a difference. Let’s do it.  👍😀
We’ve made 2%+ in some of the polls that count before (Fox, Monmouth) so we are in great position to meet this. Polls in New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina count too.
Now that we’ve cleared 130,000 donors the only hurdle left to make the Fall debates is to get 2% or higher in 4 approved polls by August 28! There are 16 polls that count.

At least the Knicks traded their franchise player for cap space.

Let me say how irritating it is that rules are keeping citizens from giving other citizens money in a way that helps this campaign even peripherally.  But rules are rules and I obviously agree with contribution limits.
We are working on Option 2 and have several people lined up. If you are interested in joining as a donor please contact joi Yes that means a citizen gets the money instead of the campaign - but that is the whole point isn’t it.
Option 2 is to say “Great. The contribution limit is $2,800. Let’s figure out a way for you to give that to someone in a way that helps the campaign.” Get 5 donors together (who haven’t yet donated to the campaign) and we fund another Freedom Dividend.
Now we are trying to figure out how to channel the generosity of those who have the means and have been inspired by the campaign to help others. Option 1 is to say “Do it yourself in your own way with zero connection to our campaign because we don’t want you to get in trouble.”
This doesn’t apply to the candidate himself. So if I do it it’s fine, though it’s considered a contribution to my campaign.
The holdup is actually FEC rules. The argument is that if someone gives someone else $12,000 and it helps my campaign (through publicity) then that person is circumventing contribution limits ($2,800). I know.
Someone approached me last night and said “I want to give someone else $1,000 a month.” He’s not the only one I’m happy to say. This campaign is inspiring generosity and philanthropy in wonderful ways.
Getting judged or attacked for things you said or did 20 years ago seems terrible. Guess it’s a good thing I was a nobody 20 years ago. Heck I was a nobody 6 months ago.  😀
A supporter tonight suggested I start doing a podcast called “Let Yang Speak” and do an annotated commentary on the debate and other topics. Like this if you like the idea.  😀👍

My guesses:  Kawhi to Lakers, KD and Klay re-sign with Warriors, Kyrie and Harris to Nets, Kemba to Celtics, Butler to Clips, DLo to Phoenix, Knicks get Randle and Rozier.
This race may be humans vs. machines in more ways than one.
Wow website traffic at  hit an all-time high yesterday!  Guess even my limited airtime generated some high-level interest.  😀👍
The past couple days have been a wonderful reminder of how many people have invested their hopes for the future in this campaign.  Thank you.  We can do it.  You all are uplifting.
A supporter pressed a $20 bill into my hand yesterday and said “use this with love.”  I just left it for my hotel housekeeper - hope that fits the bill.
Donor  is Joshua Evans from Havertown, Pennsylvania!  Thank you Joshua and thank you   Onwards to 2020!  👍🙏😀

Heck yeah - we are at 129,943 donors and will clear 130,000 donors later today! Next stop September and October DNC debates! Thank you  - you all are making history and changing what is possible in our country. We will give a special shoutout to donor  😀👍🇺🇸
 Tonight, 2020 presidential hopeful goes  with in at 7 p.m. ET. 
Wearing makeup makes me feel like Brent Spiner in Star Trek: TNG.
The erosion in trust in institutions is a problem for Dems in particular - if people don’t trust institutions they also mistrust institution-based solutions.
Confidence in our institutions has been falling dramatically across the board for decades. Solving our problems will take big measures and belief in people. 
Yes USA Women’s National Team - way to beat France!  U-S-A!  👍🇺🇸 
Proof 
I went up 50k followers in one day.  I must have been on TV.
The  in Florida is so wholesome during the day 😀 
I was the last kid who would have run for student body President. Probably a good thing.
Now to boil this down to 60-second spots.
Or if you prefer a long interview here’s a convo with Joe Rogan 
If you REALLY want to dig into what I wanted to talk to the American people about I wrote a book about it 
I’ve noticed that conservatives often follow liberals on Twitter - but the reverse does not seem to be true.

Haha  indeed.  You all are the best.  The  is amazing. 👍😀
I stood at the center of the political universe last night and did not come away encouraged by our future. Will do my best to change that.  👍🇺🇸
 With someone with your considerable public profile it would be helpful if you display a sense of openness to the possibilities instead of simply a cut and dried conclusion. There is data in both directions.  Our society depends on our getting this right.  👍
 Declining productivity stats can also be explained by the fact that we are pushing more people into lower productivity pursuits because they have to do something - anything - to survive. The stats are also backwards looking and ignore AI/autonomous vehicles/coming changes.
 Thanks Paul.  This study puts US manufacturing job loss at 85% due to automation  other studies I’ve seen have it at 80%. Trade doubtless played a role but a smaller one.
Meeting with the  last night - complete with Miami color scheme. 😀 
Overall I’m pumped for what we accomplished and even more pumped to take what I’ve learned and get out there again soon. 😀👍🇺🇸
Like you have to fake and force things even more than I’d anticipated. I’m a quick study though.  😀
Fourth, I’m glad that the network switches and we get different moderators each time.
Third, this format is not a natural one for me at all.  Requires very specific behaviors that feel very forced.
Second, I feel bad for those who tuned in to see and support me that I didn’t get more airtime. Will do better (my mic being off unless called on didn’t help) and glad to have another opportunity in July (and afterwards)!
Some reflections from my first debate:  First very glad to have the chance to represent on stage!  Truly a privilege and thank you for making it happen.
I love this campaign. If it were a straight line it wouldn’t be human. These are big changes we are fighting for. Appreciate the chance to speak to the American people - we have come a long way in a short time. We have much longer still to go.
My vision for this campaign and for this country is a simple one.  It's not left, it's not right, it's forward.  Thank you   👍🇺🇸 
Taking care of our basic needs first will allow us to better focus on solving the big problems of our time like climate change.  That's why we need to pass the  and get the economic boot off the throats of millions of Americans. 
 “Get the boot off people’s throats!”  Yes, please!

Lucky for Stephen, talk show hosts will be safe from AI for a while.  😀 
If only I got my walkout music - either ‘Return of the Mac’ or this 
I’m glad I don’t feel pressure to manufacture some ‘breakout’ moment as we are in great position to make the debates through the Fall.  😀👍
Based on last night I will get between 5 and 10 minutes of airtime tonight.  Seems about right.
Over 400,000 friends on Twitter, up from fewer than 40,000 in Feb!  The  is growing fast.  79% of Americans aren’t on Twitter - let’s spread the word to them too.  😀👍🇺🇸
I wonder who will play me on SNL.
Looks like I can forget about reading that briefing book on Yemen.
9 million viewers tonight - going to be more tomorrow.  👍😀🇺🇸
Well that was fun.  It will be highly interesting to see what impact this has on various candidates’ momentum. I wonder if voter impressions have formed or changed.
This debate both flew by and was 2 hours long.
Ooh I just saw an ad for the 2nd debates in July in Detroit!  Looking forward to that too.  Maybe I’ll get next to Joe Biden next time.
Lester Holt has a deep and resonant voice.
Inside scoop - you get an option as a candidate to have a little stage to stand on for the  to make you look taller.
Sorry Ms. Trovato my 9th grade Spanish teacher - not your fault.  🙏
Oh no - technical difficulties.  It’s the Russians.
FYI - most candidates know each other and are friendly behind the scenes. Makes it rare to take swings.
The trickiest thing will be keeping my facial expression neutral while the person next to me is talking and I’m on camera.
My Spanish is terrible.
This debate is very interesting.
Translation:  we are going to be in this race the whole freaking time.  😀
We are at 128,000 donors and counting - just about the 130,000 donors we need to make the Fall debates!  THANK YOU for putting us in this position   We will make the most of it.  👍🇺🇸🙏
Where will you be tuning in from? 
 Universal basic income proponent Andrew Yang says debate offers him ‘nothing but upside’ 

Checking out the stage for tomorrow night in Miami 
 Thanks Gilad - those were great times.  😀👍 
Top 5 in Google search data - a good sign for growth ahead.  👍 
Money doesn’t make people lazy.  Sometimes it has the opposite effect.
Hey  let’s text! Text Yang to 74217 to make a donation, receive campaign updates, and more.  😀👍 
Most Americans are not really paying attention to 2020 just yet - they are just starting to tune in. Our timing is perfect.  👍🇺🇸😀
Got a lot of new friends on Twitter in the last 24 hours.  I think people like the idea of an extra $1k a month. Now imagine $1k a month as a right of citizenship.  We can make that happen together in 2020.  👍🥊🇺🇸
Hey   The debates are in 48 hours, are you as excited as we are?  Make sure to tune in, join a watch party, and keep an eye out for our end of the quarter money bomb!  😀👍 
Landed in Miami and I am ready to speak words.
 it’s true I was educated through two recessions.
Mark your calendars!  It’s going to be a good night.  😀👍 
 Retweeting this presidential candidate could win you $12,000 
 Andrew Yang could be the wild card at the first 2020 Democratic debate 
The meritocracy will make even less sense when robots can do many jobs better than we can.  We need to rethink capitalism in order to bring it into the 21st century in a way that puts human interests and wellbeing at its center. 
 Andrew Yang is holding a universal basic income giveaway:  
Shocker - people like money.  Modifying our capital flows to get more money into the hands of people and families is the most powerful positive thing we could for our society.
Someone this weekend thanked me for running.  I told them “Thank my wife.”
Inside joke as is the guru of Universal Basic Income.  If you want to learn more about it he is the guy to follow.  👍
The winner of the Freedom Dividend - of New Orleans, Louisiana!  Haha just kidding.  😀
I’m hearing the same things 
I only wish I could give $1,000 a month to every American myself - but that’s going to take all of us banding together.  Let’s do it.  👍🇺🇸
Had a blast with and the  last night on here’s the full segment 👍🇺🇸 
 2020 Dem Andrew Yang offers to give $1,000 a month to Twitter user to test universal basic income

Thank you - can’t wait to see who wins on July 4th!!  😀👍🇺🇸

I will give $1,000/mo for the next 12 months FREE to someone who retweets this and follows me by July 4th 😃 Let's show why money is the answer ; why this is the campaign for people. No purchase necessary. US citizens only.

Our points of view are more similar than most think 
Someone told me that folks in DC are stunned by our campaign’s success - that we are outperforming senators who have been preparing for a presidential run for years. To that I say: they haven’t seen anything yet.

Talking to a doctor who practices telemedicine - he is licensed in 8 states but if he talks to someone in another state he’s not allowed to help them. That seems woefully inefficient.
Having a blast in South Carolina with the other candidates - thanks Jim Clyburn for hosting us last night! 
The Internet is wise 

That’s what I’m talking about 👍 
 the Freedom Dividend is a big idea whose time has come 👍🇺🇸
In South Carolina with the other presidential candidates.  One element of running for President is you get feedback based on how people react to you.  Based on people’s reactions we are growing fast with more to come.  👍 A lot of  in SC!
Hello  - thank you so much for your support!!  Please do keep our online discussions positive and wholesome - we will win more people over plus it’s the  way to respect others’ points of view. Thank you and let’s make history in 2020!  🙏😀👍

Let's put cash into the hands of Americans and watch the value trickle up from our families and communities. If people wake up to this as a real possibility there will be no stopping us.  👍🇺🇸 
Local journalism is vital to a vibrant democracy.  👍🇺🇸 Over 1,200 local papers have shut their doors - how can voters make decisions without knowing what is going on in their own communities? 
Escalating tensions with Iran are a massive move in the wrong direction - the American people have very low desire for another conflict in the region. I would re-enter the multilateral 2015 Iran agreement with the UK France Russia and Germany and pursue diplomatic solutions.
Cyberattacks have already crippled local governments’ computers for ransom money - sometimes successfully 
Attacking people based on poor word choice is almost always unhelpful. Most of the time we know what you meant. Manufactured/faux outrage is not going to solve the problems.
In particular everyone will know I won campaigning on a dividend for the American people. When people realize we can build an economy that works for us the momentum will be impossible to contain.
Sometimes people ask me how we will make all of these changes when I am President. Their question presupposes that I win. And after I win all things become possible. 👍🇺🇸
Pretending we can round up 12 million plus undocumented immigrants is a nonstarter - it would collapse regional economies, separate families and is essentially an impossibility. We need to provide a long-term path to citizenship and start addressing the issues in an honest way.
I’m getting stronger all the time.
Poverty is a big problem with a simple antidote: money.

Anyone running for President ought to be passionate about upgrading our infrastructure - you travel the country so much you can’t help but use it all. Planes trains highways Internet you name it. And you are constantly trying to get stuff done.

If we don’t have one by the time I take office I will make a National 5G rollout plan a top priority as President.
This will also demand that the US devise a more concerted national plan for rolling out 5G. Hopefully this is forthcoming.
Interdependence decreases the likelihood of conflict. After you force Chinese companies to adjust and adapt you have a more limited toolkit in terms of carrots and sticks.
The US - China tech trade war will have profound implications. It will be a massive setback for Chinese providers like Huawei in the short term. But if they succeed in building software independent of Google they will have a very different ecosystem. I preferred interdependence.

 As for my chances of contending for the White House - the money has me at  and rising fast. You may want to wait until our democracy speaks before you rate my - or any - candidate’s chances.
 Media figures like you should do more than cite a stat - come with me to Michigan or Ohio or Western PA and explain to the workers how their jobs haven’t been automated away because your chart says otherwise.
 When I spoke to 70 major CEOs and asked how many were looking to replace backoffice workers with AI - 70 hands went up. There’s a reason that technologists know this is real and about to accelerate.
 The low productivity stats can be partially explained by the fact that everyone has to try to find a job in order to make ends meet. Many are doing low productivity jobs to survive. These stats are also backwards looking and ignore all that is on the horizon.
 Of the 4 million manufacturing jobs lost to automation since 2000 almost half left the workforce and almost half of these workers filed for disability. We then saw surges in suicides and drug overdoses to the point where life expert has declined for 3 years.
 Thanks Paul.  As you know there is plenty of evidence to support the automaton thesis. Labor force participation is stubbornly low at 63% the same level as Ecuador and Costa Rica with almost 1 out of 5 prime working age men out of the workforce.

I’m an operator.  I figure out the key variables for success in an endeavor and then I optimize for those.  You could say I’m good at tests.

States spend welfare money on a lot of things that are not direct assistance to families 
Imprisoning a former President is the kind of thing that happens in developing countries - America should avoid falling into this pattern if at all possible. The focus should be on winning in 2020 and solving the problems that got Trump into office.
On the road to New Hampshire - see you soon!!  👍😀🇺🇸

Most political polls are done by calling people with landlines. I have the feeling that this may underestimate our support.  😀 Still we have to reach people where they are.  We have a lot of work to do.  👍

We had a campaign event and made a custom ice cream flavor for us - green tea dark chocolate!  I feel like I’ve arrived. 
So far, our growth has been exponential.  We need to end Q2 on a high note for it to stay that way.  Can you make a donation today to keep our momentum going? 
We are one of the only countries that doesn't have a federally mandated family leave policy. The data strongly suggest that paid family leave results in healthier and happier children and parents. We need to catch up to the rest of the world and do better for our families.

The biggest misconception about the  is that it will reduce work. The influx of cash will stimulate local businesses, creating thousands of jobs in our communities.  It will also recognize work that is currently valued at zero - like parenting and caregiving. 
Yes I am 👍😀🇺🇸 
Out of 19 presidential candidates in Iowa this weekend I guarantee you that several were missing family obligations.  That’s what happens when you run for President.  If a front runner says that we have different values that’s on him.
While other campaigns are still worried about 65K individual donors, we've almost doubled that. All the money that we've raised has come from real people like you, and our average donation is still $20. Can you donate $20 today to help us reach our Q2 fundraising goal?  
 So excited for this - thank you Kyle and Pam for letting me help!!  👍🙏🇺🇸

Silicon Valley parents are among the most likely to say that their kids get zero screen time.  That tells you all you really need to know.
As President I would create a Department of the Attention Economy to get into the guts of social media apps and counterbalance their financial incentives with the mental health of our kids. We can design these apps to be healthier and less addictive.
Parents are outgunned. It’s impossible to compete or insulate your kid from screens entirely. As a friend in tech said: “We have our smartest engineers turning supercomputers into slot machines and dopamine-delivery devices for teenagers.”
I also can’t imagine being a parent and having your daughter go through that. You would feel so helpless.
When I had a hard time at school as a kid I could go home and close the door.  Today your peers are right there with you in your room through your phone.  I can’t imagine going through that as an eleven-year-old.
Just spoke to a parent who said that his 11-year old daughter has been struggling with suicidal thoughts in part because of bullying over social media. I know that his daughter is not the only young person experiencing this kind of struggle.

Running for President is one part startup, one part playwright, one part media company, and one part pro wrestling.
Met another Andrew Yang last night.  One day all of us will get together.
The best balance would be term limits that are quite long - say 18 years - that would be long enough for expertise and coalitions to be built up without letting legislators become totally careerist and self-dealing.
The drawback to term limits is that they would entrench the non-legislative bureaucracy and may make it harder for legislators to organize as everyone keeps showing up new with a learning curve and a need to form relationships and coalitions.
Had an amazing rally in Minneapolis. The takeaway: you can feel bad about what's going on in this country, but the moment you start to do something about it, you feel a lot better. 😀👍🇺🇸 
Term limits in DC are a good idea - they would lead legislators to try and get something done and then go home. They would also make room for new leaders. We all know some folks have been in DC for a very long time.
College is too expensive, forcing many to take out student loans that will saddle them with debt throughout their lives. I would forgive much of this debt and work with schools to reduce tuition. We can do much better for our young people.

People won’t agree with me on everything - but I think they will respect my approach and know that I’m approaching problems with an eye toward what the data says as well as the experience on the ground. I don’t care whose idea it is if it solves the problem.

The tariffs on imports from Mexico will hit American consumers, cost tens of thousands of American jobs and are a bizarre way to stem the flow of migrants - if their economy takes a hit more people will want to move for new opportunities. It’s a big move in the wrong direction.
Automation and artificial intelligence pose an unprecedented challenge to our current version of capitalism. We must evolve towards a new form of human-centered capitalism that focuses on our success, health and well-being.

I wear makeup so often now I often forget that it’s on.
 Presidential candidate Andrew Yang weighs in on the universal basic income debate with his "Freedom Dividend" plan 
The bottom 80% of Americans own 8% of stock market wealth and the bottom half own essentially zero.  Anyone who pays attention to stock prices as a barometer of how Americans are doing is missing how most people live.
If you think our institutions are going to rescue us you have not been paying close attention.

Martin Luther King Jr. believed that a just society required the elimination of poverty, and that the elimination of poverty required Universal Basic Income.

Trying to suppress ideas often doesn’t truly make them disappear - it just pushes them into the shadows where they sometimes gain strength and currency. Being open to ideas is itself a sign of confidence in your own.

When I’m President the last thing anyone will be concerned about is the name on a boat.  We have much bigger things to focus on.
According to twins studies between one-third and one-half of political alignment is linked to genetics; that is most of us are born somewhat wired to be liberal or conservative. If this is the case we need to build bridges as much as possible. It’s not just info or culture.

Reading the Righteous Mind by - apparently there is something magical about dancing to bring people together. We should make our rallies into dance parties if possible.  😀
P.S. President Mike Pence
Personally I think the focus should be on solving the problems that got Trump elected in the first place. Democrats should focus on winning and improving people’s lives. If the political landscape changes then one can reevaluate.

The desire to impeach Trump is understandable - but the fact is impeachment is almost certain to fail in the GOP Senate which would require 67 senators to approve. Unless a bunch of GOP Senators decide to get on board it will fail, rally the GOP base and play into Trump’s hands.
Is it possible that a disgruntled employee would respond less violently if he was going home to a secure financial future? I’d say that is very possible and even likely over a large number of cases. Stress kills and financial stress kills. Universal Basic Income would save lives.
A Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month would help too - it would reduce stress levels and increase mental health across the board. A lot of job stress comes from feeling like you need the job to survive. If you didn’t you would likely respond differently to situations.
As President I would attack this problem from all angles. Mental health. Gun buybacks. Background checks. Free upgrades to signature guns. And a push to bring law-abiding gun owners to the table to say enough is enough and we can do more to protect ourselves from gun violence.
The vast majority of Americans agree on common sense gun regulations.  We can move forward. We must move forward. The alternative is to become a country numb to periodic mass shootings. We must be better than that. We owe it to ourselves and our children.
The shooting in Virginia Beach is a nightmare come to life - a disgruntled employee who massacred innocents. My heart goes out to the families and individuals who were killed and injured. We have to make it harder for people to get and use guns that can cause such tragedies.
You could put a lot of other things on the list too like mental health, graduation rates and life expectancy 
Up to  in the rankings  👍😀🇺🇸
As someone running for President I respect and appreciate how much each candidate puts into it. It requires an extraordinary level of commitment. Commentators who miss this are missing just how much work goes into each campaign, even one that doesn’t reach its goals.
Wow just found out my book the War on Normal People is getting translated into at least 3 other languages.

 at least a few young Americans are now relocating abroad to escape their student loans. 40% of loans could be in default by 2023. The $1.5 trillion in student loan debt is a house of cards that should be expunged.

Millennials have an average net worth of only $8,000 - much less than precious generations  we have left young people an utter mess of an economy.  Let’s fix it. If you haven’t set up your young people to succeed you haven’t done much to be proud of.
One thing I’ve noticed about many politicians - they are unlikely to do something they perceive as against their own interests. If this changes all things become possible.
Our data often helps to fuel AI.  As AI creates wealth, we should get a cut of that value. A  of $1000 a month to every citizen serves the same purpose. 😀👍🇺🇸 
We are very excited to release a new line of merchandise for pride month!  Get yourself a rainbow t-shirt, sticker set, or button set on our website  😀👍🇺🇸 
 put it in a way that stuck with me: our political parties are playing “First you fail, then I fail” while our way of life degrades. We need a new set of ideas and a new coalition of voters.
Real people see hope for a better way of life in this campaign 
 Wow maybe we can have the Game on out West!  That’ll be fun!  😀

This is controversial - I would even accept a pay raise for legislators if it helps lead to a ban on lobbying after the fact. A very small price to pay for a cleaner more effective legislature.  👍🇺🇸
This bill would fundamentally change the revolving door incentives on Capitol Hill.  Would be absolutely gamechanging and would dramatically improve legislation over time. Government would look out for people more and big business less.
It will be amazing seeing the rationale for rejecting this bill.  “Members of Congress are needed to represent industry after they leave office so big business will understand government.”  Please.
This ban on members of Congress becoming lobbyists is the greatest thing I have ever seen.  Pressure members of Congress to sign on.  👍🇺🇸🥊

Every American should receive a $1,000 Freedom Dividend every month starting at age 18. It would solve many problems. If enough of us get together we can make it happen in 2021.  Let’s do it.  👍🇺🇸🥊

Big news - the DNC has released its qualifications for the September and October debates: 130,000 donors and 2% polling in July and August.  We can hit those marks!  We are already at 113,000 donors and counting!
The truth is that we have earned coverage through grassroots support.  Thank you.  🇺🇸👍🙏
When we were getting very little mainstream news coverage we were like “it doesn’t matter, people get their news in other ways.” Now that we are getting picked up in the press we have changed our tune to “these journalists are amazing!” 😀

Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Rand Paul so many folks you kind of forget were there and in the running.  Reminds you of the fluidity of these elections.
Watching the 2016 debates is getting me fired up for June.  It’s also a real trip down memory lane.  A lot has changed in 4 years.
Check out our latest video from the road, this time in Des Moines, Iowa.  😀👍 
 the reality of retraining is very different than talking about it.  We need to be more realistic and responsible.
Also says that military credentials around equipment operating and other jobs should translate to civilian context.  Already in our policy list at  👍🇺🇸
Talking to a military vet - he recommends that veterans be able to get medical treatment at any hospital and have the VA pay the bill at cost.  Says that the VA doesn’t have a lot of services for women either.  Makes sense to me.  Faster services for vets at the same cost.
On a separate note I would independently strengthen Social Security so that it stays strong for future generations. A straightforward way to accomplish this is to lift the wage cap on contributions to Social Security.
I for one have no desire to live in a country where older Americans are destitute and doing subsistence jobs until the day they die. What good is unprecedented prosperity if our parents and loved ones cannot retire with dignity.
This will help address the pending retirement crisis as well as channel much needed resources to elder care and assistance.  It will create many new jobs and opportunities.
The Freedom Dividend is intended as a supplement to Social Security.  Social Security is a forced annuity - the Freedom Dividend is on top of it.  There is no reason for elderly Americans to be struggling with day-to-day expenses in the richest country on earth.  👍🇺🇸
 While Andrew Yang has hundreds of policy positions, he’s staking his presidential bid on one big idea: Universal Basic Income…
Two weeks ago, we told you we needed your help reaching our goal of doubling our Q1 fundraising in Q2. Since then, we've raised over $300,000 -amazing!  But can we raise another $300K by June 1st? Bug your friends and let’s grow the  
We should have a clear sense of what we can accomplish and what our limitations are in terms of foreign policy. We are not good at rebuilding - just look at our own communities.  We need to get better and more realistic. 
At 2% in at least one qualifying poll already.  Press and fundraising will help.  Also very achievable.  Let’s go!
130,000 donors - need another 20,000 or so.  Very doable.  😀

Americans fund the research for many pharmaceuticals, and yet drug companies often gouge their consumers while seeing record profits. This is an example of the market working against people. It's time to bring down the cost of vital drugs for Americans. 
 My turn to interview a 2020 hopeful for The Argument today. (For the record I remain anti-math.) 
Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Jamie Dimon, Mark Zuckerberg and others all believe we should move towards a basic income or guaranteed minimum income due to economic and technological changes. The time is now. 
This morning, I signed Common Defense's pledge to End the Forever War.  It was an honor to meet and join these patriots in their mission.  I am wholeheartedly committed to ending the constant state of warfare and returning military authorization to Congress where it belongs. 
There's no reason for corporations and wealthy individuals to have more of a voice in our elections than everybody else.  It's time to return the American government to its people.  👍🇺🇸

Happy Memorial Day! Here’s to elevating both veterans and the society they have sacrificed so much to protect and serve. 👍🇺🇸

The top 10% of Americans have 74% of total wealth - and the top 0.1% have 20% their highest share since 1929. This is before technology and AI make the winner-take-all economy even more extreme. Rebalancing the economy for people will take big dramatic measures.

Having journalists who are paid tens of thousands of dollars a year and work in a contracting industry being responsible for the additional award of tens of millions of dollars to pro athletes whom they are in regular contact with seems like something you would want to avoid.
Just saw Klay Thompson might have lost $30 million being snubbed from all-NBA team. Probably need a better system than journalist voting if tens of millions of dollars are at stake. MIT Sloan crew should make this a priority before journalists/players figure it out.
So of course Toronto pulls it out.  Oh well.  They also have homecourt against the Warriors - hope the East can make it a series.
Find myself going for the Bucks because they seem like a tougher roadblock for the Warriors.
The Freedom Dividend would be a great way to create a genuine economy around elder care - right now there is a need for home health care aides but not enough money going to them and other services.  America is aging fast 
We are programmed for resource scarcity.  It may be our greatest challenge to overcome - our own sense of what we can do for ourselves and our people.

Preserving America's natural resources and public lands is a duty we owe to our forefathers and to future generations. Let's keep America's lands beautiful, its monuments intact, and its water drinkable.  🇺🇸👍 
There should be a rule that if Andrew Yang passes you in the polls you must drop out and endorse him.
The paths that we are pushing on our young people are often expensive and vulnerable to automation. We should be promoting technical and vocational training, apprenticeships and skilled trades instead of just college.

That was a beautiful ending to the best show on TV.
 Waiting to watch it until later tonight 😀👍
The truth is the majority of Americans get their news from a source other than cable news. People listen to their friends first and foremost and get their info from podcasts and other new media; it’s one reason this campaign has taken people by surprise. 🥊
Would be glad to go on MSNBC or any other network too.  Enjoyed CNN and Business Insider.  If you give the  the opportunity you will see big ratings.  😀👍
I’d be glad to go on Fox for a town hall - and I think the DNC boycotting the network for its debates is a mistake. We are trying to win elections and the best way to persuade people of your point of view is to engage with them. Not talking to someone generally doesn’t work.👍🇺🇸
Great meeting with Andrew Hsu the new President of the College of Charleston. 
It's unconscionable that American kids don’t have clean water to drink. The problem right now is our will to get it done. It does not matter what it costs, we're going to get people clean water. In the end, I am going to have my kids drink from the water in Flint and Denmark SC.

Castigating all public schools or all charter schools does educators a massive disservice by calling into question the work they do with our kids every day. We should be looking to make all of their jobs easier by putting resources into both schools and households.
Of course there are thousands of dedicated teachers in public schools who are doing incredible work each day. They deserve higher pay more respect and more support. They also deserve more flexibility in how they do their jobs.
We can change this country and build a human-centered economy for all. Let’s raise $3.5 million by the end of June. If we can meet this goal, we will DOUBLE our numbers from last quarter.Please donate $20 right now.  
I have friends who have put their heart and soul into charter schools for underprivileged kids who were being failed by our public school system. Many changed thousands of lives for the better. I admire their work a great deal. They were there for the kids. No other reason.
There are very good public schools and very bad public schools. There are very good charter schools and very bad charter schools. The goal should be to make more schools high-quality and effective - not denounce an entire category.

The Democratic Party could use some new ideas.

Here’s my Fox appearance from earlier tonight  thanks
I was just playing basketball and we started shouting out the names of presidential candidates as we shot the ball.  “Bill DeBlasio!”  “Tulsi Gabbard!”  Added a lot of energy.  I won on Elizabeth Warren.
 Thanks!
Sometimes people ask me if I knew the campaign would do this well.  I always believed we would.  The most surprising thing to me is just how winnable this race is.
Thanks to you all we are guaranteed a spot on the debate stage by meeting both the donor and the polling thresholds. That’s for both of the debates in June and July.  Thank you!!  We will make the most of it.  👍🇺🇸🥊
It’s not easy to get 65,000 individual donors or register in 3 polls.  And if you miss the first Dem debate in June the path will get even harder.
I’m so glad I declared for the White House in 2018.  Gave me time to introduce myself to more Americans.  If I had to try and gain notice now it would be next to impossible.

We are trying to double our Q1 fundraising in Q2 - $3.5 million.  It’s a big goal but we can do it!  Let’s go   We can with this whole thing!  
I will say that this is about the only thing that might get rich parents to move to poor neighborhoods.
We invented the SAT during World War II to identify smart kids to keep away from the frontlines.  Now every year is wartime.
I should know.  I was quite good at them.
Standardized tests are a very poor measurement of human worth and potential no matter how much you adjust them. 
If a $20 trillion economy becomes imbalanced and punitive - as ours has - the measures to correct for it should be commensurately large.  Tweaks won’t do, especially if the winner-take-all dynamics are only accelerating.
Most of that money would add to economic activity and growth in our communities and neighborhoods.  It doesn’t disappear.  Quite the opposite.  It would bolster a trickle-up economy from our families and people up.  It would make our economy much more dynamic and mobile.
It’s our money anyway.  We are all citizens and shareholders of the richest society in the history of the world.  We all contribute to our historic growth and success - and in an economy of $20 trillion we can easily afford a dividend of $1,000 a month.
One thing that drives me nuts is when politicians or academics complain about historic and worsening income inequality and then suggest solutions that wouldn’t even move the needle.  It’s obvious what would move the needle.  Giving people $1,000 a month.  Let’s do that.
Now we have to debate it in the most important arena of all - the American public.  If enough of us get together we can make it real.  Change can happen faster than most believe possible.
Universal Basic Income is becoming more and more mainstream - it has gone from marginal idea to a proposal debated in major publications and institutions.  The truth is it is inevitable - and the sooner we make it happen the better off we will be.  👍🇺🇸

I joked that we are like Arcade Fire circa 2004.  Time to go mainstream soon.  👍
Nobody likes pennies and there are many downsides to them. They cost US taxpayers $70m a year to create, mining the zinc and copper needed to make them is bad for the environment, and counting pennies at businesses adds millions of hours of work each year. 
Visited with my friends at Consensus today.  The blockchain has vast potential.  Thanks 
I personally don’t think male legislators should be weighing in on women’s reproductive rights and freedoms.  It should be up to women. I’m happy to let women decide for themselves.
$1,000 a month for each individual would help society become stronger.   It would help many Americans decide to have and keep children.  One person said to me that the Freedom Dividend is the most pro-life policy being considered in our country.

We spend twice as much on our healthcare as other countries to worse results.  Medicare for All will get a massive burden off of both families and businesses and largely pay for itself through lower rates and expenses. 
The Alabama law banning and criminalizing abortion even in cases of rape or incest is a dramatic step in the wrong direction.  Government should not be making decisions on behalf of women.  I would protect women’s right to choose.

Young people should be buying homes, starting families and starting businesses and not trapped in their parents’ basement paying off school loans for years. Forgiving student loan debt - now at $1.5 trillion - is a better stimulus than shoveling money to banks. 
Rebalancing a $20 trillion economy toward people will require big changes.
For anyone concerned that our government is behind the curve on technology you are right. We are 24 years behind. Congress got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995 and we have been flying blind. I would bring back the OTA and get us up to speed as fast as possible.
 How Andrew Yang's online following has turned into a real-life coalition
Our lack of paid family leave for new parents puts us far behind the rest of the developed world.  I will catch us up as President.  That will be a great way to celebrate Mother’s Day in 2021.  👍

One positive byproduct of this campaign - millions of Americans are going to hear the words “Fourth Industrial Revolution” and understand that we are undergoing the greatest economic and technological transformation in human history.  👍🇺🇸

The rent is too damn high.
Entrepreneurs are some of my favorite people. But it’s not realistic or a good fit for everyone. The danger of overhyping entrepreneurship is that we substitute “be your own boss” for functioning organizations and supports. Everyone should have a chance without being a superhero.
On my way New Hampshire see you soon!  👍🎉🇺🇸 
A co-founder of Facebook says the company has grown too powerful 
Holy crap I think KD just tore his Achilles.
LeBron should demand a trade.  To the Clippers.
I had an incredible time riding with Fred Ramey, who goes by Fred the Felon. Fred is a truck driver who works all over the US. After spending time in jail, he's worked hard to get on his feet and to help others who had a similar path. I learned a lot from him. 
Warriors-Rockets is the game of the year. Why do I feel like the Rockets break through?  They seem very motivated.  Kyrie to the Nets - or Knicks if they get KD.
Someone checked - 97% of my friends on Twitter are human/normal accounts. That percentage is unusually high for political candidates who for some reason have lots of bots following them.   👍
If Joe Biden doesn’t think that China is competing with the US he must not be paying attention to AI.
Trusting in people is the best path forward. We have to start believing in ourselves.
There are nearly 500,000 children in foster care in the US. The Freedom Dividend would give more foster kids a fighting chance as they try to get their lives started at age 18. 
$1,000 a month would improve people’s health, nutrition and access to care. It would improve graduation rates and kids’ ability to learn. It would improve stress levels and mental health and create many new jobs. It’s the game changer we need in a rapidly changing economy.
Riding a bike is the best.
The Campaign as Family  could be a sitcom though I think that’s being done.  👍

I just got a text message from my own campaign.  It works.  😀👍
Studies have shown that out-of-school factors like parental time, income, words read to a child, stress levels, and neighborhood account for 70-75% of kids’ academic progress. To improve education the best things we can do are give families money and pay teachers more.
Haha with a bit on the campaign  👍
New Hampshire I am coming your way tomorrow through Saturday in Hanover, Lebanon, Concord, Portsmouth, Claremont, Hollis, Windham and Milford!   Look forward to seeing you soon!   👍🇺🇸🥊
Past mismanagement and inefficiencies do not mean we do not have the resources. Our economy is up to a record 20 trillion dollars, up 5 trillion in the last 12 years. We can easily afford a dividend that will strengthen our people, create and recognize work and move us forward.
Every shooting hurts.  Let’s do something about it while it still hurts.  The danger is we become numb and it becomes commonplace.  We can do much more - we owe it to the next generation to rise to the challenge of school shootings via both improved mental health and gun safety.
Most people who think we can turn coal miners into coders are neither.

Had a wonderful time with the  in Minneapolis yesterday!  You are beautiful and we will be back soon!  👍😀🇺🇸 Let’s do give others hope and a path forward. 

Donald Trump is the symptom, not the disease. The disease is economic insecurity caused by a changing economy that is leaving people behind. We are in the third inning of an economic transformation, and things can get much worse if we do not make our economy work for people.

You know what America will be asking during the debates: “Who is the Asian guy standing next to Joe Biden?”  😀
I get asked all the time what my plan for the debates is. I admit I’ve been looking forward to them for a while. I was on the US national debate and public speaking team in 1992. Will be a great opportunity to introduce myself to millions of Americans.

We are in an era of the collapse of institutional trust. We don't trust our government, we don't trust the media, we don't trust the schools, we don't trust doctors. There is a massive rebuilding of trust that must be earned with many Americans. 
Be there Friday Seattle!  
How did I wind up running for President?  
Congrats to the teachers across South Carolina rallying for better conditions ; higher pay. Teachers need to be paid more full stop. I will be making my first trip to the state this month and am excited for it.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Running for President only highlights for me how little voice most Americans have. Our feedback mechanisms haven’t been functioning properly for years. Let’s change it.
 I like lasagna too.
 Thanks for this!  😀👍
Haha.  I have arrived. 
I find that many things seem smaller the closer you get.  This campaign is the opposite.  The more people dig the more they get it.
Seattle Friday, Detroit Saturday, and Minneapolis on Sunday - big few days coming up on the Humanity First Tour!    come on out and tell your friends that rallies are fun and free.  😀👍🇺🇸
 Richard Ojeda is right. Universal Basic Income would help millions of Americans do much more. $1,000/mo. no strings attached. It will be spent locally, help pay off debt, the occasional night out. Thank you for the shout out Richard.👍😀🇺🇸

Why has college gotten 3 times more expensive? It hasn’t gotten 3 times better. The money has gone to massive numbers of administrators. We need to rein in the cost of college, invest in vocational programs and reduce levels and rates of student loan debt 
Congratulations on this Doug!  Overdue.  😀👍🇺🇸 
A mayor said to me “You can say things that I can’t. Keep going,”  Those are my favorite politicians.
“The battle between good and evil is a legitimate theme for . . any work of fiction, but in real life that battle is fought chiefly in the individual human heart. .. In real life, the hardest aspect of the battle between good and evil is determining which is which.”
 Working on it.  Will definitely be back!  Loved Austin 😀👍
Instead of chasing symptoms let’s cure the disease.  The disease is pervasive financial insecurity driven by an increasingly inhuman economy - and AI is about to become a game changer for many companies and workers.

The opiate crisis is a plague that is literally reducing our nation’s life expectancy - 8 Americans are dying every hour. Our criminalization of opiates is causing thousands to hide their addiction rather than seek help. We should get people treatment rather than a jail cell.

GDP is a flawed measurement that doesn’t reflect how we are doing. I’d be thrilled to celebrate an uptick in children’s health or a decrease in drug overdoses.
Many publications would make fine businesses with modest margins - but the margins aren’t high enough for public markets or private investors. New models are needed.
Politicians come to Iowa and talk to local journalists. Meanwhile many of the local papers are going under and journalists are worried about their futures. Every presidential candidate should have a plan to support local journalism as vital to democracy.

Saying that every organization should “Think like a startup” is dumb. Different types of organizations have different time frames, different goals and different risk tolerances. They also employ different kinds of people. Startups should think like startups.
On the plane to Iowa and someone shouts out “Yang Gang!”  Love it.  😀
 Andrew Yang Probably Isn’t Who You Think He Is
 Iowa I am coming your way this week to Sioux City, Stuart and Des Moines!   see you soon 👍🇺🇸

 Sort of disappointed that doesn't have a program to subsidize taco trucks in taco-deprived cities. 
 Andrew Yang, the most meme-able 2020 candidate, also wants to save journalism 
New Policy  - Data as a Property Right. Our data is ours. Meanwhile companies know more about us than our own family members and sell and resell our data for their own commercial benefit. If anyone benefits from our data, we should as well. 
Just visited a prototype for affordable housing units made out of shipping containers that cost about $35,000 each.  Very comfortable.

Committing a crime shouldn’t make you a non-citizen including your right to vote.
I am the candidate to beat Donald Trump. I am pulling support from the entire political spectrum because I am laser focused on the problems that got him elected and proposing real solutions that would improve people's lives. This campaign will go very far because of it. 
Our LA rally plus a glimpse of what’s ahead in 2020 
New Policy  - Reduce Wildfires.  The massive wildfires out West are the product of drying forests turning into tinder boxes due to climate change. Effective forest management can reduce their frequency and magnitude. We don’t need to accept them. 
Ah Vegas. So many awkward bachelor party memories.
Now that I’m in Vegas - $1,000 on red.

 Andrew Yang and the robot apocalypse. My  interview
People take their support for the presidential election very seriously.  Saying “X should be President of the United States” is a big deal.  It’s one reason I’m so grateful for the support I’ve received thus far.  🙏👍🇺🇸 Thank you.  Let show what we can do.

I’m for full legalization of marijuana. I would go a step further and on 4/20, 2021, exactly 2 years from today, I would pardon everyone who’s in jail for a low-level, non-violent marijuana offense and I would high five them on their way out of jail. 👍 
New Policy  - Restoration of Voting Rights. About 3 million Americans who have paid their debt to society lack the ability to vote.  This is particularly problematic given that ex-offenders who vote are less likely to reoffend and rules vary by state. 
Millions of Americans don’t have adequate retirement savings.  Apparently it’s even worse for Generation X - Americans 38 to 53 - almost half of whom have no retirement savings. 
They use both criteria as a tiebreaker.  We will be on stage in June and July for sure.  👍😀
We are one of only 6 candidates to qualify for the DNC debates via both polling AND number of individual donors. Thank you for making it happen.  👍🇺🇸🎉

New Policy  - Proportional Electors. Let’s be honest - the Electoral College is not going anywhere. A more feasible change would be awarding electors proportionally within each state. Candidates would then have an incentive to campaign everywhere. 
The essence of democracy is that we choose our own leaders.  How vital is America’s democracy in 2019?  Let’s find out.
Americans move across state lines less than we have in decades even as our economy becomes more dynamic. The Freedom Dividend would increase our mobility - we should go even further by providing a tax break for moving expenses and making licenses portable.

I remember when Manhattan Prep was starting out - in lean times there was a “no spending” rule. No one was allowed to spend any money. You would find other ways to get things done for a while and do only things that didn’t cost anything. I feel like a lot of families can relate.
I am glad that the Mueller Report has been made public. It’s important to the American people. My focus is on beating Donald Trump at the ballot box and solving the problems that got him elected in the first place.
We are polling at 3% and most Americans have never heard of me.  As that changes we will do better and better.  👍 
Atlanta see you at 6 pm in Piedmont Park - over 2,500  RSVPed!  Not too late to come and tell your friends.  😀👍🎉

New Policy  - Digital Asset/Cryptocurrency Regulation.  Investment in cryptocurrencies and digital assets has far outpaced our regulatory frameworks. Investors need to know what their treatment will be in order to properly innovate in the U.S. 
I would be thrilled to give autism the attention it deserves. It has been long overdue. As a parent with an autistic child, I know what families go through. We have to invest in autistic children and adults and not leave families on their own. 
We are already at 3% nationally - we can contend and win. 👍🇺🇸🥊

 I was surprised - Bernie’s answer when asked about Universal Basic Income recently seemed closed-minded and a departure from his previous position on it.   of course Basic Income is a part of the solution. I think he knows that.

 Bernie Sanders knows better than anyone what it is like to be excluded by establishment politicians. It’s too bad that he is not more open to this campaign as I know many people who like us both.  👍🇺🇸

About to head on with a bit after 11 pm.  Too late?  Nah.
We need to pay teachers more. It is an investment in ourselves. The data shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold in terms of educational outcomes.  It also shows that the best way to give kids a chance to learn is to put money into their households. 
 FTFY  
'Capitalism is basically not working for the majority of people' - The Freedom Dividend would help give many people a better path forward in our economy. It is capitalism where income does not start at zero.  
We've been shafting young people and then telling them it is their fault. Let's unshaft them.

Some thoughts on Universal Basic Income from airborne 👍🇺🇸🥊 
In 2018, I pledged to give one person or family in New Hampshire $1,000/ per month for the year of 2019. The plan would be funded through personal finances and would be used to showcase the power a basic income of $1,000/month can do for American families.This is their story. 
12-year old today:  “Good luck with the, uh, running for President thing!”  Me:  “Thanks!”
In college there were many more people who wanted to be doctors than there were spots for.  Meanwhile there are now massive primary care deserts across the country. If we need more doctors we should train more instead of having the number stay constant due to med school limits.
 Yes - let’s make Universal Basic Income a reality in the US as quickly as possible.  👍🇺🇸
 "Interest in basic income is surging. It could help solve eight of society's biggest problems" 
Yes  thanks Guy Standing
The Freedom Dividend I am championing was actually first proposed by the former president of the SEIU. $1,000 a month would help workers and give them much more leverage in negotiations since they would have something to fall back on. 
I took a 15-year break from hair product.
New Policy  - Encourage Expansion of Selective Schools.  College acceptance rates have plummeted along with affordability.  Schools are encouraged to reject many students and stay small. We need more of them to grow and even start satellite campuses. 
We are next to Bernie in small donors - this campaign is very much of the people.  Thank you.  👍🥊🇺🇸

I’d also have your taxes pre-filed for you based on past returns and publicly available information.  80% of Americans have very simple tax returns. We have better things to do with our time.  👍🇺🇸
Today is Tax Day - I would make it Revenue Day and a national holiday. I would produce a video showing you where your money goes with thank yous from government employees. You could then elect where to send the last 1% of your taxes.

Autonomous vehicles may have a similar impact. Imagine getting into your own self-driving car/pod that reclines at 7:30 am, napping and watching early morning TV, and getting dropped off at the office at 9.   You could live pretty far away.
In Asia I’ve ridden a train that goes the distance from NYC to DC in 100 minutes. Imagine what that would do for an economy. Whole new communities would be developed that would be newly commutable. Changes one’s ideas of time and distance.
I’m a big fan of trains and wish the US had more modern railways. Heard recently that airlines have lobbied against high-speed trains that would reduce business across particular routes. Trains would be better for the environment and on other levels.
I don’t have any complaints.  I remember riding the bus a lot when I was younger.  Compared to that Amtrak feels great. 😀
Generally speaking booing your team doesn’t make them play better.
 Awesome!  👍🇺🇸

On my way to DC for the CNN Town Hall on Sunday at 7!  Riding the private jet known as the Amtrak.
 Disagree - freeing up the President’s time is a big deal. Imagine if the time is spent building relationships with legislators that gets an important bill across the finish line. This increases those opportunities.
Holy cow - the Nets have a system and can score.  Embiid way less than 100%.  The Nets can win the series.  What a disaster that would be for Philly.
New Policy  - Appoint a Head of Culture and Ceremony. The President should focus on improving our lives as much as possible. Someone else should pardon turkeys and congratulate sports teams. Most Americans would rather meet Oprah or the Rock anyway. 
Over 2,000 people have RSVPed for the Humanity First rally in DC at the Lincoln Memorial on Monday at 6!   Bet it goes up after Sunday night too.  😀🇺🇸🎉

I was in New York on 9/11. I remember walking uptown away from the WTC in a crowd of thousands. Remembering 9/11 does not mean inciting hostility toward Muslim-Americans who are just as American as anyone else. As President I would bring us together. We are all one country. 👍🇺🇸

Hello all - my Town Hall on CNN has been moved to 7 pm on Sunday.  Tell your friends and start those parties an hour earlier.  👍🇺🇸 
Yup. 
I understand the passion and frustration with the Electoral College.  For those who wish to change it, again, our challenge is to win the election in 2020.  Focus on that and when we win we will be in better position to have these conversations.  👍🇺🇸
If I were to advocate for any change it would be to make states award electors proportionally instead of winner-take-all. This would lead candidates to campaign everywhere and not just the ~12 battleground states. I believe Americans would appreciate this change a great deal.
Third, it runs the risk of making Democrats seem like we are losing elections by the rules that have been in place for decades so we need to change the rules. That’s a very unprincipled place to be.  We need to win an election by the rules we have before we call for any changes.
Second, the incentives would drive candidates to campaign in high-density cities and big media markets.  It would skew both campaigns and policies against lower-density rural areas in a very direct way.
First, getting rid of the Electoral College would require a Constitutional amendment. This would be a non-starter with many legislators whose states would lose electors.  It’s an impractical conversation to raise.
I think Democrats calling for getting rid of the Electoral College are off-base for a few reasons. Of course I get the beauty and simplicity of saying “whoever gets more votes wins.” It seems like the essence of democracy and has a strong innate appeal.
New Policy  - Reverse Partisan Gerrymandering. Politicians in both parties like to make districts ‘safe’ for incumbents. Unfortunately this makes them more responsive to primary challenges from the extremes of their own party and increases polarization

This weekend:  1) Game of Thrones premiere 2) NBA Playoffs begin 3) CNN Town Hall on Sunday at 8 pm EST.  Seems like the best TV weekend in quite some time.  😀
Acceptance rates for selective high schools and colleges have plummeted over the past number of years as competition and interest have picked up. An obvious response: create new schools.  Instead of rewarding schools for being selective we should increase the number of spots.

 Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang Defends Plan to Give $12k/Yr to Everyone 
New Policy  - Public Council of Advisors.  We should assemble a council of experts, artists and thinkers to advise the President and the public on the issues of the day. If done right it could improve both decision-making and public discourse.

This made me angry  I would lead us the other direction and get the burden of filing taxes off of the American people to the extent possible. We have better things to do.
Wow. The Lakers may have just overtaken the Knicks as the most dysfunctional NBA franchise. And they have LeBron James!! That seems impossible.
 Why Andrew Yang is the most radical 2020 candidate:  

For the Yang Gang in Nevada - we’re shooting some videos and would love you to be in them with me!  Fill out the form below if interested.  See you April 23-24!  😀👍😀 
This is what I’m doing after the rally tonight in Boston!  😀🇺🇸👍 
 Basic income would improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans overnight.  I do not see that as a corporate handout.
 If you think a guaranteed government job is the same thing as Freedom we have a real difference in opinion.
An AI system defeated elite Chinese doctors in a two-round brain tumor diagnosis competition on both speed and accuracy. This could do incredible good but is another example of areas in which new technology is capable of beating humans. We have to evolve quickly. 
 Haha 😀
 Amazing thanks Andy!
 Maybe the end state we are working toward are the same thing.  Fighting for humanity and freedom.  👍
 I love anything that helps people start businesses.  👍 Thank you for your service.  🇺🇸🙏

 Should Boston be worried about the effects of automation? Andrew Yang thinks so.
 We fought so hard for  to get MSM attention, and  is finally on the way.  Please mark…
 Thank you Jessica!  Will try and get your neighbors to join you.  😀👍🇺🇸
 Welp, now all my neighbors know I'm  Hopefully they'll follow suit.  😎🤙 
 Thank you!!  Can honestly say I never saw this coming.  😀
 Oh, I’m going EVERYWHERE in this shirt!    
Scarcity won’t save us or provide a path forward.  Abundance will.
Universal Basic Income would be a game changer for millions particularly for those at higher risk. LGBTQ Americans are more likely to be kicked out of the house or fired from a job based on their identity. UBI would help provide security and a path forward for all Americans. 
Probably should have said over a thousand instead of over a 1,000 - you know what I mean 😀
Boston we are coming your way tomorrow!   over a 1,000  already signed up 👍😀🎉🇺🇸
That is messed up.  I always leave a tip. 
We have made the DNC Debates and raised millions from small donors across the country - Thank You!  Now the hard part begins.  👍🇺🇸🥊

Iowa we are looking to demonstrate that receiving $1,000 a month is positive for people’s health, mental health and way of life. If you know someone in Iowa who you think would be glad to share their story please send them our way!   👍🇺🇸
New Policy  - Invest in Quantum Computing and Update Encryption Standards. Other countries are investing billions of dollars in next-generation computers that could render current encryption standards obsolete. We should invest and prepare new standards

Riding home from New Hampshire someone asks me my first rock concert.  “Depeche Mode 1990.  Violator Tour.”  The opener was Jesus and Mary Chain.  My team makes me feel old sometimes.
We are looking to hire another Andrew on the campaign. As a result I have started to speak in the third person. “Andrew is doing a great job.” “Andrew likes chicken.”
Had a blast with in Concord NH with hundreds of New Hampshire voters  👍🇺🇸 
 Good ideas transcend politics! Loved the chance to hear and have conversation about how we can reform…
New Policy  - Get Rid of the Penny. It costs more to make a penny than it is worth. It consumes time and environmental resources. We will be better off without the penny.  Other countries have made this move and it has been positive.

My tips - make the core numbers work. Always be honest with your people.  And don’t get so wrapped up in your goals that you lose perspective.  👍
The toughest thing about balancing a mindset of abundance with a mindset of scarcity is that they both can be correct and helpful in the same day.  Too much of an abundance mindset and you wind up with Fyre Festival.

 2020 Candidate joins tonight at 8 pm ET.  
My book is currently the 231st bestselling book on Amazon  that feels pretty high
I am an INTJ.
New policy  - 18-year term limit for Supreme Court Justices. The fact that we are scrutinizing the health of 80-year old judges is a clear sign that we should evolve from lifetime appointments that help elevate political clashes 
Here’s an excerpt 
Published an excerpt from my book on the impact of automation on white collar jobs  a lot of jobs you would consider safe may not be
This is the campaign of ideas, solutions and compassion.  People will win again.  It’s our best hope.
Most Q1 layoffs in a decade  not a good sign
 Looking forward to this 👍
Let’s go get that money.
Someone today asked me how a mother of 4 should think about the Freedom Dividend. I responded “As a parent imagine if you knew every one of your children would start receiving $1,000 a month at age 18. That’s over a million dollars. That’s a gamechanger.” She liked that answer.
 says that our current version of a capitalist economy is not working for most Americans and needs to be dramatically reformed. He says a national emergency should be declared around inequality. He is right. Let’s do something about it together. 
We qualified for not just the June DNC debate in Miami on NBC but also the July debate in Detroit on CNN.    Detroit coming back your way this summer!  👍🇺🇸
Economic insecurity reduces people's IQ by 13 points. When you don't have enough money, food, or time, it makes you less reasonable, less rational, and more subject to negative impulses. It is imperative we solve for this and why the Freedom Dividend will improve the US. 
The only thing standing between me and the White House is popularity.
More from my interview with on 
Who am I indeed  thanks 👍
Enjoyed the interview with on a great deal 👍🙏 
Young Americans report being less happy than in previous times 
We should have a psychologist in the White House. I have thought this for many years. My brother is a psychologist. The health of a person goes beyond just physical health. This move would reduce the stigma and set an important tone for our nation. 
 Looking forward to this 👍
New policy  - Revive the Office of Technology Assessment.  If it feels like Congress doesn’t understand technology we got rid of the office that used to advise them on tech in 1995.  I know.  Let’s bring it back pronto.  
I have many friends who recently lost their jobs and are now in professional limbo. Highly educated types whom you would never worry about. There is an undercurrent to this economy that is stealthily pushing people to the sidelines - and these are supposed to be the good times.
Hanging with on had a great time 👍😀🇺🇸 
First time seeing my face on a book cover - kind of strange.  In the past I made a comment that having one’s mug on the cover seemed political.  Then my publisher suggested it was a good idea after I became more of a thing.  Lesson learned.
My book, The War on Normal People, came out in paperback this week. I hear it might have a shot at being a bestseller. Lots of good data and math in there. Get a copy if you haven’t and I’ll sign it during our tour 😀👍🏽🇺🇸  
We are in the midst of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The 1st was mechanization and steam. The 2nd was industrial production and factories. The 3rd was the Internet and digitization. AI and robotics will make this one the most dramatic and disruptive.

My CNN Town Hall is the hour before the Game of Thrones premiere on Sunday at 8.  So hopefully people will start watching TV an hour early.  😀
I am coming to grips with the fact that half of my favorite Game of Thrones characters will almost certainly die this month.
More than anything I appreciate the lively discussion and the ability to disagree. I would never expect someone to agree with me on everything but I hope that people can arrive at different conclusions while maintaining a general degree of openness. 😀👍 
16 year olds can drive and they pay taxes. The benefits of engaging citizens younger seem to outweigh the cons. But I would understand disagreement with this 👍😀.
To the fact that many 16 year olds are politically uninformed - sure. But it’s not like we are giving voters pop quizzes at the polls to see how much info they have. We have low information voters voting all of the time. There might be a correlation with other factors than age.
To me right now our electorate skews older on every dimension.  And our policies reflect it.  Younger people participate less and are disengaged.  Anything you can do to move the needle there you should explore.
I love the discussion on this one.  If you use full cerebral maturation as the main criterion you would raise the voting age from 18.  No one seems to be advocating for that realistically.
 thank you for leading on this 👍🇺🇸

 Just kidding I’m wearing the same thing 
Holy cow I just found out my Mom follows me on Twitter.
 I’m wearing something different right now.  😀
Officiated a family wedding this weekend - love you cousin may you laugh like this always 😀❤️ 
More robots than ever are at work in the US. 2017 saw a 60% rise in robot usage within food and consumer goods companies. We are in the early innings of a fundamental shift in how work gets done. 
New policy  - Lower the Voting Age to 16.  Getting young people voting early makes them voters for life.  Our politics will affect young people for decades to come. They should have a say in their own future.  
 Thanks Topher

The astounding thing is ~95% of donations came in after February 11th.  We pretty much raised all of the money in the 2nd half of the quarter from small donors.  This bodes VERY well for our sustained growth.  😀👍🇺🇸
Our Q1 fundraising numbers. THANK YOU. This campaign has come so far. We are changing the conversation and we can do so much. There’s a new type of economy on the horizon 😁🇺🇸👍🏽 
New policy  - Decrease Pre-Trial Cash Bail. Thousands of Americans are being incarcerated because they cannot afford bail prior to trial. This results in many taking plea deals they might not have otherwise.  it should not be illegal to be poor in the US.
 Thanks for being such a great partner and publisher Paul.  👍🙏
And here is my yearbook photo in action 👍 
The Freedom Dividend would help hundreds of thousands of Americans rejoin society after serving time in jail. Money helps with many things. How would $1,000/month help you? 
Sometimes in an airport you think you’re seeing a cross section of Americans. In truth it is probably more like the top 30%.
Pointing out the automation of jobs is helpful - championing the Freedom Dividend to enable millions of Americans to more effectively transition is the main thing.
Red eye flights are like lousy teleportation devices.
My book ‘The War on Normal People’ goes on sale tomorrow in paperback  if you were waiting for the book to get lighter and cheaper now is your chance.  😀👍
Video from our rally in Chicago last week 👍🥊🇺🇸 
I am for Equal Pay, Paid Family Leave and on-site and subsidized childcare. I've seen how deranged corporate America is towards women; we should do all we can to make it better. Our lack of federally funded parental leave puts us in the ranks with Lesotho and Swaziland. 
 WIRED talked with about his methodical, data-driven, science-happy 2020 presidential campaign.  
New policy  - the Canine Dividend.  GDP continues to go up and up, while the number of dogs per household has remained stagnant. Nothing would do more to improve the mental health of every American than providing them with 1,000 dogs per month 
March was a huge month for the campaign and April is going to be even bigger.  👍😀
Spotted in San Francisco 👍 
There are times when doing nothing is not cool.
We did it - we cleared $250k for the Moneybomb and then some!  THANK YOU to everyone who made it happen!!  You all are amazing.  😀🙏🥊 Lets go all the way.
Americans are going to have a harder and harder time retiring securely  we adopted Social Security in 1935. It’s past time for an upgrade.
This campaign feels very necessary.
We have a special pre-sale  T-shirt from now until midnight  it has been a hot ticket all day. I love it.  😀🎉
Only 4 hours left and we are pushing $250k for the last few days!  Wow.  Thank you for the incredible support - let’s end the quarter on a high note and give people notice that we are the team to beat!   😀🥊🇺🇸

New policy  - Extend Daylight Savings Time All Year.  Switching back and forth literally kills a few Americans each year due to an uptick in accidents.  DST has real benefits.  We should just pick the time and stick to it. 
Today is the last day of March and we are reporting our fundraising progress! We need your help to put up a big number. As a special incentive we have a pre-sale on a new  T-shirt just for today  pick one up or donate today!  👍🇺🇸😀
It’s helpful to be simply fighting for what you believe.  You never have to remember what you’re supposed to think about something.
We are in the final day and are doing great!  Thank you for making this YOUR campaign.  😀👍🥊 With your support we can change the course of history.  🇺🇸
The economic imbalances have been building up for years and are now at historic levels.  Technology will only exacerbate the winner-take-all dynamics.  Addressing imbalances this big will require commensurate solutions.  $1,000 per adult per month will make a big difference.
36 hours left!  The Moneybomb is approaching 200k!!  😀👍🥊 THANK YOU for helping us show that we can win.  Let’s make today and tomorrow our biggest days yet!  🎉
New policy  - Relocate Federal Agencies. Washington DC is now one of the most expensive and crowded parts of the country. Relocating certain agencies would reduce costs, spread out the benefits and make our government more responsive  ht
People can tell when you’re actually committed to something.  It makes a big difference.

You all are giving me the chance to fight for the future.  I appreciate it a great deal.  Thank you.  I promise to make the most of it.  👍🙏🇺🇸
Giving every American adult $1,000 a month is so obvious a fix to our rampant income inequality that it will happen very quickly - it just needs more of us to wake up to our own power.
Getting rid of debt may help your brain function better  imagine what the Freedom Dividend would do for us all
Universal Basic Income works. Here is some of the data found from 461 papers and 35 experiments done on cash transfers over the last few decades.We should have passed the Freedom Dividend years ago.  Let’s do it now. 
New policy  - Democracy Dollars.  The best way to counteract corporate lobbying money is to make it so that gaining popular support also gets you financial support. $100/person/year just for campaigns. No more sucking up to rich donors and companies.  
 Yes
Heading to Miami June 26-27 for the debates!  Will have a rally there for sure 😀👍🇺🇸  
Nice piece in about this being the people-powered campaign  true democracy at work thanks 👍🇺🇸

Well it looks like my senior year yearbook photo is about to make the news in a feature about candidates when we were young.  Sharing it here so you can see what I was about in 1992.  Favorite bands: the Smiths and the Cure.  😀 
And we are off!  Already approaching $100k for the day - THANK YOU.  👍🇺🇸🥊 Let’s get it.
The Mets always seem to win Opening Day.  It’s the rest of the season you worry about.
MONEYBOMB. We have a huge reporting deadline this Sunday night and we need to show that we can raise big money ; compete. Townhalls/debates rely on it. If you can please donate today and bug friends to join you.So much is possible here. THANK YOU!🔐💰🇺🇸 
Get on board now.  You’ll look smart in a little while.  😀
 I support the right of workers to unionize and organize 👍🇺🇸
New policy  - Ranked Choice Voting. Our current first-past-the-post system rewards incumbents and often does not reveal voter preferences because people are afraid to ‘waste’ votes. The process matters. Ranked choice voting would improve our democracy.  
As someone who really likes trains and wishes we had more modern ones in the US this brief account of Amtrak was interesting

Doing media on a campaign is a bit of delayed gratification - you spend time interviewing and then a week later it comes out.  And by then you are doing something else.
 ICYMI: Why Would a Presidential Candidate Ever Campaign in Chicago?
Had a great time in Chicago!  😀👍🇺🇸 
One thing I’m proud of - people have a pretty clear idea of what I’d do as President.  
I remember watching The Matrix in a movie theatre and leaning over to my friend to say “this is the greatest movie I’ve ever seen.”  
Parenthood is not easy.  Every parent pursues the best for their child while climbing over obstacles each day.  Entrepreneurship is defined as pursuing an opportunity without regard for resources currently under control. So in a way all parents are entrepreneurs.
Big fan of Marianne Williamson’s message of humanity and would love for her to join the DNC debates.  👍🇺🇸  When I’ve met Marianne’s supporters they’ve always been awesome people. 
Humanity First Tour locations and dates will be announced soon!  Looks like Boston will be one of the early stops in April.  😀👍
The story of what each person would do with the Freedom Dividend of $1k/month is powerful. David is helping to tell that story. It was incredible to meet him. This campaign has so much warmth and love. You can see his work on IG:freedomdividend2020 
Driving toward this March 31st deadline!    The more we raise down the stretch the greater momentum we will establish as the campaign to beat in 2020 👍🇺🇸🥊
Still the champ 
We will be announcing a new policy proposal every day for the next month.  The first - decriminalizing opioid use and possession.  The War on Drugs has not worked.  We should refer addicts to treatment not a prison cell.  
Never thought I’d run for President.  Meeting one helped. 🇺🇸👍 
As a politician I’m a pretty good entrepreneur.
McDonald’s just bought an AI company to change its drive-throughs 
 recognizes the impact that automation and artificial intelligence will have on millions of Americans and that universal basic income may be necessary. 
After we pass the Freedom Dividend millions of Americans will say “Wow the government did something right that really improves my life!”  There will be a lot of excitement.  Then we will get other things done too.  👍😀🇺🇸
Climate change is an existential threat that is about to speed up.  Real solutions are needed.  This is an area where our government has to lead to shift market incentives.  Kudos to the lawmakers who are stepping up to propose big steps in the right direction.
Frederick Douglass wrote that “It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.”  He’s right.  What he left out is that it is also hard to build strong children.  We need to invest more in our kids from Day 1.
The tallest room I’ve ever been in - Chris Webber’s birthday party.
Little known fact about me - I was an entrepreneurship mentor for the NBA Players Association for a while.  Met many current and former players and felt quite short.  Being a pro athlete is much tougher than most imagine.
You know what I’m pretty sure works on a lot of problems?  Money.
 I am going to find Bianca.  👍🇺🇸
I’m a very practical person.  If I find an approach isn’t working I’m very happy to try something else.  Following your preconceptions too far is a great way to find yourself in a ditch spinning your wheels going nowhere.

Millions of American women are stuck in exploitative or abusive jobs or relationships because they lack the economic freedom to walk away. The Freedom Dividend of $1,000/month would empower women and enable them to directly improve their situations. 
I would support a transition to new models of public private supported journalism 
1,300 communities in the US have completely lost local news coverage  if you believe in democracy you need quality local journalism to keep voters informed
Wow almost 200,000 friends on Twitter!  Amazing.  I will celebrate by reminding myself that 79% of Americans are not on Twitter.  😀👍
I feared for the future of the US.  Then I started fighting for a better version.  Made me feel better almost immediately.  I highly recommend it.
Young people are depressed.  They have reason to be - we have left them an awful mess.  Let’s clean it up as fast as possible.
We have a reporting deadline on March 31st this Sunday - let’s finish the month on a high note!  THANK YOU.  👍😀🇺🇸
Apple is a little late to the game on content.  A lot to choose from and most people have made a streaming choice or two already.
Many people have some artistic passion that they would pursue if they didn’t need to worry about feeding themselves next month. A Universal Basic Income would be perhaps the greatest catalyst to human creativity we have ever seen. 
We have a fundraising deadline on March 31st and are trying to drive donations down the stretch!  Swag purchases count.  😀🇺🇸 
The Yang Gang is strong in Chicago!  👍🥊🇺🇸 Had a blast - back soon in a bigger venue!

Going to our event there is a ton of traffic.  Then we see a Yang Gang sign and realize it’s because of us.  😀
We have over 72 policy proposals on our website   But that’s not enough.  We will be releasing a new policy every day for the next month starting this week.  👍🇺🇸 Let’s dig in and solve the big problems.
I remember when the press was trying to make Avenatti a thing.

 Lead story in today's Carroll (Iowa) Times Herald: Norm-shattering presidential candidate plans to campaign…
Trust is one of the most important ingredients in a successful society.  Unfortunately our trust in institutions has collapsed in the past 40+ years.  The question is how to rebuild that trust and/or give rise to people and institutions that Americans can believe in. 
Spent much of last week in New Hampshire  thanks 👍
I always believed that the job is to beat Trump at the ballot box.  And then solve the problems that got him elected.  👍🇺🇸

 is right on in this conversation with Universal Basic Income would be a more efficient use of money and it would help us immensely as we transition through this period of great disruption. 
This is an important story - human contact is increasingly a luxury good  screens have gone from a status symbol to a commodity
The Freedom Dividend would help immediately - $1,000 a month per adult would go very far in rural areas. It would make paying local property taxes and school costs more affordable and enable people and communities to make better transitions.
In the interim you often have escalating property taxes to pay overhead for schools because there are fewer households. This is a double whammy that drives people to leave and often makes selling one’s home difficult.
One problem in rural areas is shrinking schools. One school in northern New Hampshire had only 4 students in its graduating class. Consolidating school districts means long commutes for kids, letting teachers and administrators go, vacant schoolhouses and political battles.
Millions of Americans are underbanked and rely upon payday lenders who charge extortionate rates. But every community has a post office. We should allow post offices to provide basic financial services as they do in other countries. Would help everyone. 
I had Wonderboy.  Wow.

If we want to get serious about reducing waste in the US we should reexamine our packaging practices.
Nowhere is our misplaced obsession with ‘efficiency’ more evident than in the lack of paid family leave for new parents and mothers. Paid family leave is positive both economically and socially. We need to join the rest of the civilized world and adopt it.

When I meet local journalists I root for them. They have a tough and important job that is getting tougher all the time. I’d support new models to support local journalism  it’s hard for people to vote if they don’t know what is going on in their own towns.

We just made yard signs, posters and the MATH hat available in the store.  Thank you for spreading the word!  Plenty more to come. 😁 
Northern New Hampshire is no joke. 
I know.  Thank you!  😀👍 
  
It’s not left or right it’s forward 
Paying for the Freedom Dividend is much easier than many think. It would not cause much inflation, would be good for business, and help millions of Americans towards better opportunities in life. Good companies invest in their people. It is time we do the same.

Apparently recidivism rates for certain violent crimes among men are very low partially because people age out and testosterone levels drop. Many did something as a teenager and then got released years later.
Just spent time with an ex-convict who helps reacclimate other formerly incarcerated men into society. He suggests tax breaks for hiring ex-cons. I’m for that but unfortunately don’t think it would do enough. Everyone deserves a second chance though - this guy is now thriving.
Humanity is more important than money.  The unit of an economy is each person, not each dollar.  Markets exist to serve our common goals and values.  We can make this happen. 
Looks like I’ll be on later today - might be my first time.
We will peak at the right time.  Getting stronger every day.  👍🇺🇸
I feel like being able to have a pet is a worthy benchmark of quality of life. Not a fish. A real pet. 
Awesome event in Plymouth NH with with local Dems 
Automation is ramping up and will impact every corner of our economy. 
As someone who was very good at standardized tests growing up I think they are a terrible measurement of anything other than whether you are good at the test. Certainly have nothing to do with human worth, character or virtue.
Depression among young people has skyrocketed  we should take this very seriously and try to treat and strengthen from every angle
These Midwestern floods are a genuine disaster  was just in Iowa last week and feel for those affected.  🙏

Here’s on the Freedom Dividend last night.   👍🇺🇸 
 Thanks Kevin 👍🇺🇸
I find that not talking to people is a terrible way to convince them of anything.
 would be happy to have a convo - my team will follow up.
The Yang Gang is growing - this is what we stand for.  Rule   Always talk about Yang Gang.   
Heard I was mentioned on last night.  Sign of things to come.  😀👍

Heading to Plymouth, New Hampshire today with   come on out and see you soon 👍🇺🇸
We’re going to have to think a little bigger.
This economy stopped working for most people years ago. Unfortunately the winner-take-all dynamics are about to accelerate as technology and capital converge. The question is what to do about it.
Small but mighty adjustment to my icon 😀 
The Freedom Dividend is pro-work, not anti-work.  It will create more work in our economy and recognize the work that is already being done. 
My team is amazing - imagine having people whose job it is to make you look good.  I appreciate it every day.  They even got me a haircut.  😀
Never thought I’d be part of a Gang.  Just goes to show.  👍
Great to see you Austin - be back soon!!  👍😀🇺🇸  Had a blast. 
Just to clarify - I support the freedom of parents to adopt circumcision for any religious or cultural ritual as desired. Actually have attended a brit milah myself and felt privileged to be there. Thanks Mikael.  Always up to parents.  👍
We are experiencing a mental health crisis in America: record levels of anxiety, depression, addiction and even suicide. My brother is a psychology professor and I am passionate about getting more Americans proper resources. I’ll do that as President 
I don’t think tweaking rules is going to save us.
 Not quite the cover but I’ll take it.  👍
 “The opposite of Donald Trump,” Yang added during his rally in San Francisco, “is an Asian guy who likes math” 
 Thanks Nate.  👍🇺🇸
 Andrew Yang has crossed the threshold where we consider him a major candidate, so here's his theory of the case: 
Holy crap my Twitter handle just changed to  There can be only one.  😀
We are the richest society in the history of the world - $20 trillion GDP up $5 trillion in the last 12 years alone.  We can easily afford a dividend of $1k/month per adult if that’s what we want to do. Anyone who says we don’t have the money isn’t looking at the right numbers.
The plan is to tell the truth and listen to reason.  That’s the whole plan.
Um sold out in 25 minutes.  We get it - more on the way!!  😀👍🥊 Thank you for being such awesome passionate supporters!!  🙏🎉

We’ve raised over $1 million since Feb 12 - THANK YOU for making it happen!  Let’s keep the momentum going!  Tell a friend to donate a buck today.  😀 
Sometimes I think of this race without us in it and it makes me really glad we are doing this thing.
US rates of incarceration are 4 times higher than most other industrialized countries, and it’s a national disgrace. People on both sides of the aisle now recognize that our system is badly in need of reform. I will make our system less punitive.

Lou on on the case for Universal Basic Income. 
We all make mistakes.  It’s called humanity.
Someone today said I’m campaigning for the Federation.
Submissions welcome to depose the leader.  Please keep it clean.  😀👍
The current leader for best song about me: 
Chicago we are coming your way next Monday!   don’t worry it’s indoors.  👍
Criticizing someone for something they wrote as a teenager is stupid.
This may be the most meta campaign for President yet. 😀
Apparently the incentives for energy efficiency vary greatly across state lines based on differing costs.  If the Federal government were to elevate the incentives in low-cost states it would help spur a reduction in both consumption and pollution.
My thoughts on New Zealand and the campaign’s next chapter 
We are leaving a mess of an economy to the next generation.  We can do much better. 
Interview with  thanks 👍
My appearance this morning on  Yes, yes I do.  
The ratio of days I have makeup on is getting higher.
 Andrew Yang is Ross Perot for millennials, says  
Scheduled to appear at 8:45 this morning on  Excited for it. 
I remember Ross Perot  thanks
Thanks to your donations we can focus on spreading the word.  THANK YOU.  I can’t tell you how good it feels to have your support.  Let’s take it all the way.  😀👍🇺🇸
Somehow the American people have become underdogs in our own land. That is messed up.  Let’s fix it.
A friend sent this to me - my odds of winning the nomination are quite high according to the Internet.  How smart is the Internet?  We will see.  😀 
Sometimes things can change very quickly.
Also Duke to win it.
As we fill out brackets, it’s worth noting that NCAA March Madness makes over $1 billion a year for the schools involved. The NCAA should pay star athletes some of what they are bringing in.  
I would make Tax Day a holiday, allow citizens to choose where 1% of their taxes go, and make it a celebration.  Show a video of where your money goes and thank you.  Citizens deserve to be more involved and appreciated.

We are going to have to do it ourselves.
The problem with deciding Presidential elections via popular vote is that candidates would naturally campaign in urban areas with big media markets and their policies would follow suit. Better to have proportional electoral college votes in each state so you campaign everywhere.
“A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.” - Paul Romer
Money doesn’t fix everything.  But it helps.
The idea of the American meritocracy is on ever-shakier ground 
 Why 2020 candidate Andrew Yang wants to give every American $1,000  
If you think things are going great I may not be your guy.  If you think we need significant changes to build an economy that works for people and families I might be just what you are looking for.
 have it right - I am going to ban robocalling as President.  Our time and attention are our most precious resource. I remember being glad when I got a phone call because it was a friend or loved one. Let’s get back there.
Scheduled to appear on tomorrow on to talk about my run for the White House. 👍🇺🇸
My book the War on Normal People is out on paperback April 2  also read the audio version.  Hear it’s good at 1.25x.  😀
I don’t think people mind that much if you disagree with them as long as you respect their point of view and are open to learning more.
Turns out meeting someone online and meeting them in person are very different experiences.
Made the evening news in SF 
In government most all of the time you are building consensus. You provide a vision and try to rally people around it. You build relationships. You compromise. You appeal to common goals. Things often happen more gradually. But when big things happen they can improve many lives.
As a CEO you can pretty much tell people what to do. You are their boss. You are paying them. If you say we are doing something then it generally happens. The downside is no one tells you unpleasant truths.
There are lessons and principles that government can take from business - like treating customers well and resource efficiency. But anyone who says they are going to “run government like a business” is dumb. They require very different forms of leadership.
We have to make Humanity an advantage.
Instead of all of these profiles on people who “made it” we should also show people’s struggles and pitfalls.  The success mythology fuels a lot of nonsense, guilt and misconception. Not every ending is Made for TV.
I started this campaign as a relative nobody who thought he could make a difference.  Thank you for proving me right.  👍🙏🇺🇸 Lets take it all the way.
Only 6% of American high school students are in vocational training - in Europe it is closer to 50%. We need to promote technical and vocational apprenticeships in the US. They lead to great jobs that will be with us for a very long time. 
What a rally last night in SF.  Thank you - keep fighting for what’s right.  👍🥊🇺🇸  
 Yeah maybe.  2 not good.
We may have to get rid of the penny.
I’m not sure skywriting is a good idea.
What is our potential?  Let’s find out.
A growth mindset is key.
As the son of immigrants I understand what it’s like to make a life in a new country. There is a place for everyone. There is no place for hate. Love and Humanity First. 
Health care bills play a role in 60% of personal bankruptcies  “$26k for a night of observation”.  We can do much better than this.
 
More like this 
Feels like history.  👍🥊🇺🇸 
A lot of people don’t pay attention to politics.  That is why we are going to win.
That about sums it up 👍🇺🇸 
Perhaps math will unite the tribes.

Generally speaking our society should be a little more forgiving. Shame in particular loses power if overused. And beyond shame lies entropy.
Glad James Gunn is back.
On with telling the folks in SF about the campaign and our rally tonight.  See you soon San Francisco.  👍🎉 
Math hats debuting soon 👍🇺🇸 
If being recognized on the street is a sign of progress we are doing quite well.

This is an incredible value - 2x your donations to charity + get a true American patriot in the debate stage!  John Delaney is a great guy.  👍🇺🇸 
Tribalism is part of human nature.  When tribalism is distorted, amplified and poisoned terrible tragedies occur and atrocities become possible. The goal is to keep that from happening. That is our challenge.
As the son of immigrants attacks on immigrant communities pain me on on a personal level. Everyone wants to make a better life for their families.  There is a place for everyone. There is no place for hate.
The shooting in New Zealand is a horrific tragedy and reflects the worst form of depravity.  Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment are the opposite of what we stand for.  My heart goes out to the families and communities affected.  Love and humanity first.
Strong men treat women well.
  spotlights the most interesting 2020 Democratic candidate you might not have heard of: Andrew Yang. 
Sometimes I get asked about our media strategy.  Our strategy was to say yes to whomever asked.  Just trying to introduce myself to as many Americans as possible.  👍🇺🇸
150,000 followers. That was fast.  Follower is the wrong word isn’t it?  More like trackers or enthusiasts or friends.  👍😀 Thanks for being first.
 Andrew Yang is running for president.Haven’t heard of him? You will soon. 
 with a profile saying it looks like we are headed to the DNC debates 👍🇺🇸 
Portugal decriminalized opiates in 2001; if you are caught with 10 days or less supply they simply take your drugs away and you are referred to a doctor, counselor and social worker for treatment.   Both the overdose rates and usage rates dropped.

If you watch on tonight with a certain presidential candidate may make an appearance 😀👍 
Artists and entrepreneurs have the same effect on a community - they make it more vibrant and dynamic over time.  The Freedom Dividend would enable millions of artists to pursue their creative passions.  
 Thank you Shireen.
Traveling with my staff, I told someone to secure the bag.
 Yes I’m sure we will continue to be.
 I hear you.  Thanks for understanding.  👍
 I grew up in upstate New York.  Love the country dearly.  Doing what I think is right.  If I imagine dark things that may be on me.  Don’t mean to attack anyone.  Trying to solve problems.  Appreciate anyone else who wants to solve problems too.  👍🇺🇸
 I get it.  Don’t mean to bring anyone’s race into anything.  Again trying to address the problems that affect us all.  👍
 I have the feeling that if we descend into automation-fueled madness and scarcity then terrible things will happen.  And yes that could well be one of them.
 I have the feeling that if we looked up the ownership of the 300 million firearms in the United States we know where the majority of them would be both absolutely and proportionally.  This is not racism.  It’s math.
 Reason it’s been done in the past.
 You are the best Marianne.  👍🙏❤️. Learning from you.

 My campaign is about calling out the reality of what is happening to us.  We are being ground up.  It is tearing us apart.  It will take Herculean efforts to keep us together.  Pretending that the descent will be gentle doesn’t help anyone.
 We are the most heavily armed country in the history of the world.  Everyone knows what I think is ahead. Why would one imagine disintegration to be gentle?  It will not be.  For any of us.
 Violence has occurred in several black churches and Jewish synagogues in the last years. It would be awfully optimistic to think that something similar would not happen to other communities.  I am trying to keep the country strong and whole for my kids and yours.  👍🇺🇸

A student in Iowa said to me last night “I’d love to vote for someone I actually like instead of voting for someone I dislike less.”  Made me happy because it seemed she was talking about me.
We are up to $1.5 trillion in school loans up more than 15x from 1999.  Default rates are rising and bankruptcy doesn’t give you a way out due to bank lobbying. College has risen in cost 250%. The system has become a crushing burden on many. Something has to be done. I’ll do it.
 Everyone hates student loan debt.  Not just well-off.  Plan will include some investment on part of borrower in most cases. 👍

 I love this and support a large-scale forgiveness plan.  👍🇺🇸
I support a forgiveness plan for a huge chunk of student loans. Young people should be buying homes, starting families and starting businesses and not trapped in their parents’ basement paying off phantom loans for years. It’s a better stimulus than shoveling money to banks. 
 Thanks Alyssa!!  Be in touch soon!  😀👍

More than 11 million Americans are addicted to opioids - many of whom are struggling in silence or not seeking treatment for fear of criminal prosecution. We should consider the case for decriminalizing opiates in order to more effectively treat more people for addiction.

 No.  Saying that they wouldn’t.
 That doesn’t get money from Amazon or help people whose jobs get eliminated
 Agree.  Think there are ways we can ID and curb fake news without curtailing press.  Requires incentives beyond clickbait.
 Exactly.  If Congress won’t do it then it won’t happen.
 Of course not.  Have to get Congress to pass laws.  That’s how it works.  👍🇺🇸

 I like that too Jon.
 The shame of it is that a union would be better for the sport long-term. Would draw better athletes. Better pipeline. More mainstream stars. Easier to watch with a clear conscience.
 He’s in a tough spot.  So are the fighters.  That’s sort of the point.
 Been following you for a long time and appreciate your awesome coverage.  Looked forward to your weekly chat for a long time.
 You don’t know how long I’ve cared about MMA Ariel.  And you are clearly not the bad guy here.  Just saying it’s going to be tough under ESPN.  I remember them firing Bill Simmons for messing with the NFL.  The relationship is too new for someone to question the fundamentals.

 No.
 NBA NFL NHL MLB all in the same place.  Want to be a major sport got to walk the walk.
MMA fighters in the UFC receive only 10-15% of revenues vs. ~50% in other sports. I would apply the Ali Act to MMA and allow fighters to unionize. Firing when her opponent didn’t make weight was clearly retaliatory.  should stop boasting about revenue.

The most disorienting thing about running for President is that good images become a deliverable.  Not exactly leadership principle 
 Definitely
 We have some great Dem candidates this cycle and I hope gets more attention for some of the interesting ideas…
 Thanks Peter 👍🇺🇸
Putting buying power into our hands will give rise to a whole new set of opportunities. It will lead to unprecedented levels of entrepreneurship, creativity and caregiving.  We can make the economy work for us instead of being inputs into a machine.
The dynamics of the winner-take-all economy are only accelerating.  Reversing them will take policies that seem dramatic but have the potential to actually move us forward. We need to start trusting people and not institutions.
Studies have shown that even the winners are unhappier in unequal societies.  Higher levels of distrust, suspicion and alienation.  Inequality is bad for everyone.  And inequality is at record highs in the US.
It’s clear that a robust middle class helps people at every level.  Strong consumers mean strong businesses.  Money in consumers’ hands would circulate several times throughout the economy and generate accessible jobs.
Trickle-down economics doesn’t work. We should put more buying power into people’s hands. Part of this is increasing tax rates at the top to be more progressive. The Freedom Dividend and a VAT to harness the gains from new innovations would lead to a Trickle-Up economy.
 Thanks Joey
 Thanks will do!  😀👍

 Unenforceable to appropriate others’ UBI.
Tech has gone from being deified to villainized in record time. They have historically been immune from regulation because no one in government understood tech. The next step is to curb and address abuses and excesses. I know enough techies to believe they would be open to this.
Another issue is how we get information. Does fragmenting the social media apps solve the fake news problem or help bring us into a common set of facts? Unclear that it does. We need a nuanced approach to big tech with a different toolkit than we have historically used.
One big issue is acquisitions. The current business plan for startups is to get acquired by one of the behemoths. This is what is truly consolidating power and innovation in certain companies.
Sometimes tech companies should indeed be forced to divest parts of their businesses.  Shouldn’t control both distribution and then sell your own wares at an advantage like Amazon does.
Agree there are fundamental issues with big tech. But we need to expand our toolset. For example, we should share in the profits from the use of our data. Better than simply regulating. Need a new legal regime that doesn’t rely on consumer prices for anti-trust.
 Agree on this.  👍
 Positive on blockchain
 Wow thanks!  👍
 Sorry Kevin be back soon 👍

The temptation is to think that breaking up tech companies will restore Main Street businesses. It won’t. We need to think much bigger about how to address the problems of the 21st century economy. Sharing the gains from new innovations is the place to start.

 Great will send shortly.  Thanks Dax!  👍
 The fact is what I’m recommending is a greater economic transfer of resources toward people and families than anything else remotely in the table.  Please weigh the actual impacts and numbers.  Thank you.  👍
 Not removing anything.  Supplementing existing programs with an additional $1.8 trillion in human hands. Would make millions of families stronger and healthier.

 Why does the reasoning matter if we are discussing abolishing poverty?
 No but I want to.  Mike agree with your perspective and want to help.  Different forms of school and work are needed for both people and society.
 Ha thanks
 Hey Dax.  I respect the politics-free zone.  Would love to send you a copy of my book and you can have some other folks on if the ideas are of interest.  👍  Keep talking sense and congrats.
 Please dig more deeply into both proposal and facts behind it.  Thank you and keep up your great work.  👍🇺🇸
 Multiple reasons to support UBI.  Completely dissimilar from Murray proposal which kept spending constant. I’m proposing 2x+ increase. Labor participation rate now at 63.2% near multi-decade low. New jobs are for different people in different places with different skills.

Also helps with enabling women to improve their situations and avoid abuse or harassment, communities of color accessing better opportunities and many other social issues.
I’m for investing in a national mental health initiative.  But simply putting $1,000 a month into people’s hands would help our collective stress and mental health more than anything else we could do.
Similar logic applies to many of our other systems. 70-75% of kids’ academic performance is determined by out-of-school factors:  parental time, income, neighborhood, etc.  Putting resources into families’ hands would improve kids’ abilities to learn.
The efficacy level of federally funded retraining programs for manufacturing workers was approximately 0-15%. Almost half of the workers left the workforce. If retraining is the answer we would need to be much better at it.  It’s not a realistic answer for most.
I could say “we will educate and retrain all Americans for the jobs of the future.” Or I could say “we will put $1,000 a month into the hands of all Americans.” The latter is much easier to do in real life than the former. And the latter would help more in most cases.
It is much easier to modify our capital flows than it is to upgrade complex systems and bureaucracies.    If we get the money right many other systems will improve:  people will be stronger, healthier, better educated, mentally healthier, and more entrepreneurial and creative.
 Extra! Extra! Listen all about it!!      Deep dive on the issue…

 Man the guns issue is tough.  I know that people feel very strongly in both sides.  I believe there are good things we can get done that don’t impinge on gun owners’ lawful rights.
I live in a world where if I put my mind and heart into something I can make good things happen.  That makes me very lucky.  I appreciate it every day.

Here’s the list of countries with no paid leave for new mothers - Lesotho, Swaziland, Papua New Guinea and the United States of America. Let’s get off this list and give parents time with their children when they are born. We will all be better off for it. 
 This is messed up.  We are the richest most advanced country in the history of the world.  We can do much better than this.  As a parent I’m angry on behalf of you and your kids.

 Andrew Yang raised 571k in February. I'm going to bet that's more than some candidates many take more seriously.
History is instructive.  But we are living in unprecedented times.  We may have to do some new thinking about the problems of the 21st century.

One way to make the transition home easier for military vets - have their qualifications from the armed forces transfer to civilian environments. Vets tell me that hazmat transport and other certifications don’t count when they get home. Experience in the military should count.

 Thanks Erika.  😀👍
A mindset of scarcity has a profound effect. Studies have shown that an inability to pay one's bills can reduce functional intelligence by the equivalent of 13 IQ points, almost one full standard deviation. Pervasive financial insecurity may actually be making us dumber.
 Thanks for the thoughtful response.  I think reasonable people can come together on common sense approaches.  Most Americans agree that there shouldn’t be absolutes on either side.

 Thank you just tweeted 👍
Just think about how much value is being lost because people from tough backgrounds aren’t able to access opportunities and paths forward. A Universal Basic Income would largely pay for itself by allowing more people to reach their potential. 
 Thank you Andrew 👍🇺🇸🙏
America has spent over a trillion dollars and lost thousands of lives on wars that have accomplished little of discernible value. This does not include the incalculable harm we have done and many lives we have destroyed. I would end the Forever Wars.

Hundreds of thousands of American women today are in exploitative or abusive jobs and relationships in part because they lack an independent income. A Freedom Dividend of $1,000 per month would be a gamechanger for millions of women to improve their situations.
Running for President is significantly about camera angles.
 Thank you Vanessa!  😀👍

It’s hard to understand exponential growth in computing power.  If a 1971 VW Beetle had advanced according to Moore’s Law, today it would go 300,000 miles per hour and get 2 million miles per gallon.  That’s how fast our computers are advancing.

The entire socialism/capitalism dichotomy is out of date. Technology has changed our economy for good and requires new approaches. We must now build an economy that values people directly and leads us through the 21st century.

The federal government just announced its first AI initiative. This is overdue but welcome. The real step is putting resources behind it - including billions of dollars for computing resources. The Chinese and others are funding AI development.  We should do the same.

 Thank you 👍
I get emotional about facts.
 I believe there are multiple strands - but I think the economic backdrop is crucial myself.  Having worked in the Midwest and the South things are not going well for many many people.
If you look at the voter district data, there is a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in that district and the movement towards Trump. We blasted away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Michigan and other swing states and Donald Trump is our president. 
 Positive.  I like EITC too.  Prefer Dividend because of universality, timing of payments and administration.
It feels great knowing you’re doing exactly what you’re supposed to be doing.  I want more people to have this feeling.  Let’s do it.
Thank you Marianne - you are a true leader.  👍 
I occasionally think of the other Andrew Yangs out there.  I hope I have their support.  😀
I think things can get worse.  I also think they can get better.  Unfortunately one is the path of least resistance.  The other will require us to fight for it very very hard.  👍🥊🇺🇸
 may be about to catch up 👍
 When I’m President I’ll use real numbers 👍
 I like the vision and priorities
 65k.  Had 15k coming in.  👍
The automation of labor has been going on for years. We automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs starting in 2000. Many of those workers left the workforce and our labor participation rate dropped. Today it is around 63.2%, near a multi-decade low and the same as Ecuador. 
 I like Elizabeth Warren.  Have people in common.
33,500.  That was fast.  Should I keep updating now that there is a progress-meter on the website?  Sure!  😀👍
 Not really
 Yes
 Sooner
 Past mismanagement does not mean we don’t have the resources.  We very much do.  The economy is up to a record $20 trillion up $5 trillion in the past 12 years. The Freedom Dividend will be spent here and circulate throughout the economy.
There is nothing stopping the majority of citizens of a democracy from declaring ourselves a dividend.  When people start realizing this we will change the course of history.  It will happen faster than most think possible.
 Reddit AMA is scheduled for Thursday, February 28th @ 11:30am Pacific on r/Politics.

 Regional inequality and financial insecurity - moving takes resources.  Many can’t move because they are underwater on a mortgage or house that has lost value.
 For the Paris Accords, carbon fee and dividend, investing hundreds of billions in more sustainable and resilient infrastructure, and agree that climate change is an existential threat to our way of life and must be addressed as soon as possible.
 Sure 👍
The annual rate of interstate relocation has dropped from 3.6% of the population in 1970 to 1.6% in recent years. This is the opposite of what you’d want in a dynamic economy. We should help more Americans move for work - it’s good for them and the economy 
 Thanks Andrew
 Yes  👍
 Going to be rough - let’s fight for a better future together.  👍
 Glad you did 👍
The problem is that we need work - and a lot of work won’t need us.

Big money has ruined our political system. The fix is quite simple: give each citizen $100 "Democracy Dollars" per year that can only be donated to political campaigns. This would wash out the influence of big money and give power back to people. 
Thank you all for the incredible support! We have crossed 32,500 donors. We are halfway there! This campaign is bringing together the best people. Let's not let up now. Tag a friend in this post and ask for $1. Let's get on the debate stage. 👍🥊 
The Freedom Dividend would enhance the dynamism of our society on a staggering scale - more businesses, arts, creativity, migration, risk-taking and innovation.  Imagine how many people have something inside of them they have wanted to share.  We will unleash our own potential.

Rural areas around the country are losing people and vitality as main street stores close and agriculture becomes increasingly mechanized.  A Freedom Dividend of $1,000 per adult per month would go a long way toward revitalizing these towns and giving them a path forward.
The adoption of new technology is generally slow and then all at once. Many industries right now are on the verge of great change.

About one-third of Americans graduate from college. That means if you were to pick your five best friends, the odds of them all being college grads if you took a random sampling of Americans would be about one-third of one percent, or .0036.

If you know someone in Iowa who would benefit from $1,000 a month let us know!   they will owe you a big one if it comes their way.  👍😀🇺🇸  Let’s make an economy that works for people.
 Yes
Since 2009 student loan debt has more than doubled to more than $1 trillion for millennials alone  default rates are climbing fast. I would forgive many of these loans as an economic stimulus.  We are crushing the next generation with debt.
 Very much for a carbon fee and dividend 👍
 Complex question.  Depends on situation, individual, geography, etc.

 Sure.  Hi.  👍😀
Our campaign traffic, volunteers, follows, press requests and donations are all at record highs and increasing. Every indicator is heading way up to the right. As a numbers guy I can tell you this campaign is taking off. Thank you.  Let’s show what we can do.  🙏🇺🇸🥊
30,000.  Watching the number rise is addictive.  I hope you agree.  😀
 Not suggesting we do.  Our capital flows are MUCH easier to modify than our energy infrastructure.  One will accelerate the other.
First we get the economic boot off of everyone’s throats. Then when people are thinking a bit more clearly we tackle climate change. It’s hard to get folks who are struggling to make ends meet to focus on big societal problems. First activate abundance. Then we can advance.
 Thanks Joel 👍
 Think relying on the labor subsistence model indefinitely is the wrong way to go.  Perfectly happy to see people getting paid $15/hr+ which would happen for everyone getting paid $9+ right now with $1,000 a month.  Small businesses are not made of money.
 Thank you!!  👍
There are so many people struggling in America today.  It becomes obvious as soon as you start to look.
 in points out how Americans worship work - and how it is making us miserable  working harder and harder for less and less is not a recipe for success

The Freedom Dividend is deeply American. Thomas Paine, MLK Jr., Milton Friedman were all for it, and it passed the House of Reps in 1971 under Nixon. There is even one state with a dividend - Alaska where they call it the 'Oil Check.' We need a Dividend for the US.

Great to meet with the Euclid NAACP in Ohio this morning.  Martin Luther King Jr. championed Universal Basic Income.  We can make it real in 2021. 
Technology is fundamentally changing many aspects of American life.  Meanwhile many of our legislators don’t understand how Facebook works much less the impact of AI and automation on the economy.  We need to catch up to the true challenges of the 21st century.

That is 27,000!  You all are the best.  We are on our way.  👍😀
GDP is higher than ever but it is clear something has gone wrong with our economy. We have to start optimizing for how people are doing. The market is about to turn on many Americans. We have to evolve.

One reason we sometimes wind up with extreme politicians is that we have a one-round process that does not always reflect people’s true preferences. Ranked choice voting would help reward candidates who command broad support and would lead to better results. The process matters.
 Don’t disagree.  Saw limits.  One reason I am going a different direction now.  We need to think much bigger than most investors would allow.
 Look closer at my background.  Founded non-profit to help Detroit, New Orleans, etc.  👍
 Thanks Andre.  Happy for these ideas to be front and center.
 For data as a property right.  Agree.
Wow fans in Cincinnati, Ohio at Rhinegeist.  We are doing this.  👍🇺🇸 
 That wasn’t UBI
With AI we should be able to cut the expense structure of the federal government in particular.  Businesses are about to take advantage of epic efficiencies.  We should try to have our government do the same.
 Sorry Adam
One thing I love about this campaign is that it is all upside and growth.  I don’t have a political reputation to preserve.  This is a high variance campaign with the chance to change the world.  Thank you for seeing its potential.  Let’s achieve it.
To be clear we need 65,000 total donors by May 15th to make the debates. We had 15,000 coming in and are now at close to 27,000. We are getting about 1,500 new donors per day so we should get there in a month or so at this rate.  😀 Thank you all for making it happen!!  👍🇺🇸🎉

Universal Basic Income is not a new idea. Milton Friedman, Nobel prize-winning economist, supported it in 1962. It would simplify our welfare programs and give our people the freedom to use the money as they choose. Believing in people is fully American.

I’m for full legalization of marijuana; remove it from the Controlled Substance List. I would go a step further and pardon everyone who’s in jail for a low-level, non-violent drug offense. It makes no sense to have people in jail for something that is legal in other states.

 Who Is Andrew Yang, Why Is He Running for President, and Why Did He Win Our Super Official Slog Poll?
Cars and trucks can already drive themselves down the road to deliver pizzas - it's happening right now. There are tens of thousands of Americans who presently deliver food for a living. 

I have worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs and one thing they have in common is a mindset of abundance and opportunity. Universal Basic Income would give millions the sense of security they need to start a company. Business and creativity would boom. 
Received over $250,000 in new donations the past 10 days from 14,000 donors and just passed the 22,000 mark overall.  Thank you!  We are doing this thing.  👍🇺🇸🥊 Every day we get stronger.  😀

 For the spirit of it.  For forgiving many school loans and reducing college costs.  For giving everyone $1,000 monthly dividend starting at age 18 which would improve everyone’s choices.
Sometimes a journalist will say to me “You’re polling at 1%” as if it’s a bad thing.  I respond, “That’s right.  And that’s when most Americans have never heard of me.  We are only going to grow from here.”
 Thanks Preston
 Not yet hope to soon
Great speaking at Georgetown last night - met many awesome young people.  Charged up.  👍🇺🇸 
The headline unemployment rate doesn't tell the real story. Our labor force participation rate today is down to 63%, the same levels as El Salvador and the Dominican Republic, largely because 5 million manufacturing workers, were pushed out of the workforce in the early 2000s. 
 On today's Opinion page: 'When working hard doesn’t cut it,' from breaking down universal…
 On pace but need to keep going 👍😀
I love the spirit of a $15/hr minimum wage - no one should work full-time and not be able to live. But it would hasten the reduction of many retail and fast food jobs and doesn’t include caregivers. Much better to just put $1,000 a month into people’s hands - a raise of $6/hour.
 This poll from now closed, and guess who won?  Looks like there's some passionate
 Thank you!

US antitrust laws are hopelessly out of date. They are designed to prohibit price gouging due to monopoly power. Today’s tech giants would never dream of gouging. Instead they price others out of the market and consolidate. The consumer wins but many lose. We need new approaches.

Wonderful time in Baltimore last night - let’s show what we can do.  👍🥊🇺🇸 
When I am President I will appoint a Head of Culture to congratulate sports teams, pardon turkeys and handle other ceremonial duties.  Most Americans would rather meet the Rock, Oprah or Joe Rogan than me anyway.  😀 Everyone wins.
 Thanks 👍
 Thanks David!  👍
Bernie Sanders has inspired millions of people and transformed our politics.  I was an admirer and still am.  I’m glad he’s running as I’m sure his work will continue to move us all in the right direction.

 Would forgive significant proportion of student loans as stimulus and create a 10 year repayment program.  Also would allow loans to be discharged through bankruptcy.  And then reduce school costs by tying loan access to cost ratios.

 Thanks Adriel.  The right people can overcome many things.  👍
Georgetown University I’ll be speaking at Lohrfink Auditorium in the Rafik Hariri Building at 7 pm on Tuesday as part of the Presidential Lecture Series.  Look forward to seeing you soon.  👍

A mindset of abundance - and many incredible supporters - have taken this campaign very far.  And we are only getting started.
 For ranked choice

1,500+ donations today!  You all are amazing.  At this rate we will clear the bar by March.  👍😀🇺🇸 Keep them coming!
 Amazon could pay taxes without passing it all on to consumers.  Companies do it all the time.
Wow.  Amazon paid no federal taxes last year on profits of $11.2 billion.    Need to move to a VAT which would generate revenue from the real winners in this economy.  Our system must evolve.
 It adjusts for inflation over time.  People will still be cost sensitive and there will still be competition between firms (I.e. Samsung and Google vs Apple in your example)
 Just once 😀

 Rescheduled this trip - but will be back March 10th!  👍🇺🇸

 I’d expect a bit of purchasing power to be eroded in the way you describe.  But most of it would stay in your hands.  In your Netflix example that $4/ month increase times all of your services might eat up ~$100 of the $1,000

Thank you all - we’ve received almost 7,000 new donations in the last five days!  At this rate we will blow through our goal by May.  👍🇺🇸 Will have a progress-meter soon on the website.  Let’s keep it going and get on that stage!  Thank you!  🙏🥊
 I’m a fan of holistic medicine.
 Thanks Chuck!

 This is true too 👍
I would make tax incentives for companies to move domestically 100% taxable thus removing their appeal. It is ridiculous that cities and states bid against each other to no net economic benefit for the US. Companies should simply move where it makes most sense for their business.
Healthcare should be a basic right for all Americans. We need to provide high-quality healthcare to all Americans and a single-payer system is the most efficient way to accomplish that. 
Just wrapped up interview with - enjoyed it.  Thanks Pete.
 Thanks Marianne.  There is a reason we are disintegrating.  Let’s fight for the future.  👍🇺🇸
 Andrew Yang’s “The War on Normal People” is rocking my world and I’ve only read two chapters. We need this book.

Great meeting earlier today - a phenomenal woman and leader.  Her message is very powerful and needed.  Look forward to sharing the trail with her in the days ahead.  👍🇺🇸 
Phenomenal news - we have raised over $130,000 in new donations from over 5,500 new donors since February 11th, the best stretch of the campaign.  Thank you.  I know just what to do with it.  😀👍

Deaths now outnumber births among white people in more than half the states in the country. Much of this is low birth rates and white men dying from substance abuse and suicide. Our life expectancy has declined for 3 years. We need to do much more.

The chances that an American born in 1990 will earn more than their parents are down to 50%; for Americans born in 1940, the same figure was 92%. The American Dream is dying despite our nation being richer than ever. We need to make a system that works for all Americans. 
 Thanks Bryan 👍
 Thanks Scott
 We are pretty good about that.  👍
 Thanks Dave
 Thanks Arjan
 Thank you!
 Thanks!
 About 15,000 and climbing fast 👍
 Yes but only counts once.  😀

 Citizens or green card holders.  Bug your American friends.  😀
I need 50,000 individual donations by May 15th to make the Democratic debates in June. Even $1 counts.    If you haven’t donated now is definitely the time. Tell your friends. Thank you and let’s show what we can do! 👍🇺🇸😀 Will be providing weekly updates.
 Yes.  Forgive debt.  Grant statehood if that’s what they want.  Rebuild.  Make it a national project.  I got married there.  They are Americans and we should act like it.
Met a teenager from West Branch, Iowa whose entire town was devastated by the shutdown because they rely upon people visiting the Herbert Hoover library and the nearby national park - both of which were closed for a month.  They are still recovering. 1 month’s pay tough to miss.
 Just keep beating the drum Tony.  We need 50,000 small donors by May to get me on the debate stage.  👍🇺🇸
 Thanks Brad 👍
 Thanks Ashley 👍
 That’s right.  Thank you.  We are shooting for 100,000 donors to be safe.  😀
 Thanks Tim
Enjoyed the Joe Rogan Experience a great deal.  Wrote about it and my trip West here.

 About 15,000
 Thanks Jennifer
“I voted for Mr. Trump for many reasons. I don’t agree with everything he does, but you don’t seem like you’re a politician. You really seem like you’re a genuine person that has the American people at your heart.” 
I am so pumped to have concrete goals for us to hit by May 15th.  We are going to operate and hit that debate stage in June.
 I think any amount counts!  👍🇺🇸
 Thanks!
 Thank you!
 Thanks Patrick!
 Thanks!
 Thank you
 Thanks Ernesto 😀
 Grows every day - we will get there.  Have 3 months!
 A ways away. We are at about 15,000 now.
 They count.  
Big news - the DNC just released the criteria for making the debate in June.  1% polling and 65,000 donors.   Let’s do it.
 Yes 
 It’s self-defense.  Will change if people see it in action and as possible.  👍

Happy Valentine’s Day!  I really didn’t like this holiday as a kid.  Always made me feel self-conscious.  Now that I’m married it’s . . .  a little bit better.  😀❤️
Some confuse Universal Basic Income with socialism. Socialism is when you nationalize the means of production. UBI is capitalism where income does not start at zero. Rather than spend tax income on bureaucracy it is given directly to people. 
 Thanks Zach
 Here 
 Thanks 
  👍
 
Spotted in Boston 👍 
Starting early 
 Not touching existing welfare programs - Freedom Dividend opt-in
 Tax on those who win the most in new economy
 Not taking anyone’s welfare away
 Hope to be there soon 👍
57% of Americans cannot pay a $500 bill. 78% say they live paycheck to paycheck. It is not realistic to expect people to be politically functional if they are dealing with scarcity day-to-day. We need to secure people's future with UBI to move forward. 
 Thanks Scott
I like Netflix.  Their management has a job to do.  But that they could report record profits and not pay any tax in the US is a sign that our system isn’t working 
 Positive on individual level not widespread enough to judge economic impact
 Thanks Brittany 😀👍
 Income mobile.  Easier to move.  Easier to cohabitate pool income etc.

 Wouldn’t have happened without you Sam 🙏
 Wonderful conversation between and Andrew presents the best case for "universal basic income":…
60 robots do 70% of the work in this warehouse and they've increased productivity by 300%. 
“Hospitalizations due to mental illness fell as much as 8.5 percent” during a basic income trial in the 70s. Today, depression rates are climbing with suicides and inequality at an all-time high.  Basic income is a mental health issue. 
 For universal healthcare 👍
 Thank you 👍
 Still the case.  Sometimes use UBI as a general term.
 Freedom Dividend
Just got shoved by a homeless guy in LA who ran straight at me shouting about something I did.  Mid-50s.  Would be good if there was an incentive to help him.  Freedom Dividend would help - new economic incentive to help people function. After shoving me he walked off shouting.
 Thank you
Getting lots of new supporters today.  Thank you - let’s show what we can do.  👍🇺🇸🥊
 Thanks Derek
 Thank you 👍
Universal Basic Income would completely transform our nation. Would take many Americans out of survival mode and give them a sense of the future. Families ; relationships would improve. People will be more reasonable. Those with less will benefit the most. We can make it real. 
 Thanks Ashish
 Thanks Robert
New York will feel like Arkansas and Philly will feel like Memphis by 2080.   great challenge of our time.  The US is only ~15% of global emissions - reducing emissions likely won’t be enough.
 Understand Matt and appreciate your consideration and open-mindedness.
Nice write-up on my campaign and foreign policy priorities in  nice picture too
 Thanks Kevin
 Thanks Robert
 Thanks Niles
 Thanks David
 Thanks Erik 👍
 Thank you.  Let’s do it.  👍
My appearance on is now live  thank you 👍
Paying for Universal Basic Income is much easier than many think. It would not cause much inflation, would be good for business, and help hundreds of millions of Americans towards better opportunities in life. Good companies invest in their people. It is time we did the same. 
 For detecting asteroids that could hit earth.  Should have done that already.  Support other efforts.  👍
Appreciate Cat and her work profiling the campaign and answering some of the big questions surrounding Universal Basic Income. Let's make it real. 
 No reason I can’t be

The Freedom Dividend will invest in people early and give them the resources to be stronger, healthier, mentally healthier and better educated. We will save billions as fewer people end up in our prisons, emergency rooms and on the street.

How you respond to disgusting pictures corresponds to - and might indicate - how conservative or liberal you are  if we truly do have biological indicators it should make us all more open-minded to those who disagree politically.
I feel like I’m doing exactly what I’m supposed to be doing.  Thank you for making that so.  👍
 Thanks Solange 👍
 Thanks Barbara 👍
The shutdown exposed what we've all known and felt - most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Thousands of our gov. workers ended up in food kitchens just to get by. Our nation is in survival mode. Big changes are necessary.

We blasted away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Iowa, and then in 2016 all of those states turned red. That should be the problem that Democrats try to solve but for whatever reason, they are not addressing the elephant in the room.

The Freedom Dividend of $1k/mo. for every adult would be the most direct way to empower women. Millions of women in the US are in exploitative or abusive jobs or relationships and lack the economic freedom to walk away. We can change that and increase self-determination for all. 
One thing I can’t believe Trump hasn’t done is invest in infrastructure.  It’s bipartisan it creates jobs and it’s falling apart.  Just left us more to do after we beat him and get him out of there 
 thanks for the great article.  Launched my campaign in the New York Times last Feb 👍🇺🇸
I really am the opposite of this guy. 
One year until the Iowa caucuses.  One year until we point a new direction for America 👍🇺🇸 
Our average donation is only $19.  If you want to bring that average up - Thank You!  If you want to bring it down - also great!  The important thing is increasing the number of donors.  😀👍🇺🇸
Don’t let them distract us.  Focus on the money.
Great to see at in Raleigh. Love his leadership as one of the next generation of Dems.  Let’s move the country in the right direction.  👍🇺🇸 
 Great to meet and and hear about their visions for America!

 We know it is wildly popular and that a majority of Alaskans - a deeply conservative state - said they would approve of higher taxes to retain the dividend.
Someone suggested that we make the day after the Super Bowl a national holiday.  That seems a bit much to me.  First Election Day.  Then Revenue Day.
My brother is a huge Patriots fan.  I . . . am not.  The Super Bowl tonight will make one of us very happy.
Every senior in high school should visit another part of the country for a month, stay with another family and get to know other 18 yr olds from across the country.   this would go a long way toward making us more open and less divided.  🇺🇸
Great meeting with the amazing people at in Des Moines making schools more human.  😀👍 
Student loan debt crushing senior citizens  wish that was a misprint.  School loans badly need reform.  I would forgive much of this debt.
Miss these guys - Daddy will see you soon. 
Most people have no idea what they’re capable of.  We need more of us to find out.

Phenomenal house party with the Woodbury Dems Truman Club in Sioux City, Iowa last night. One of the most fun nights of the campaign.  👍😀 Thanks 
 The max they can drive is 14 hours before the truck starts beeping that they are in violation. Then 10 hours required rest. Beds are in truck. Truck stops have showers and laundry. Away for weeks at a time. Most have families. Don’t think robots can replace them.
 Thanks Pat.  Trying to get a better sense of what the future holds for truckers with self-driving trucks - and what they think it holds.
 Thanks Dean.  Only way I know how.
Riding a truck from Altoona, Iowa to Grinnell with Dennis Bogaski, who owns a small trucking business.  Learned a ton about what truckers do every day. 
 Thanks Travis 👍

To the extent that the US can help restore stability and provide aid to the people of Venezuela we should.  My heart goes out to the Venezuelan people who are suffering due to failed leadership over a period of years.
Venezuela is on the verge of becoming a failed state. Sanctions - which would hurt the people- aren’t helpful nor is talk of military intervention. The goal should be free and fair elections and Venezuelan self-determination. The US should not be in the business of regime change.
 Yes.  They are Americans.  👍
 Thanks Joey.  Alyssa congrats on all you do for the country.  Let me know if there’s anything I can do 👍🇺🇸

 Welcome aboard Alison!  👍😀🇺🇸
I have known Cory Booker since he ran for mayor of Newark.  He has set a powerful example of service over the years.  It seemed like a presidential run was always in his future - glad the future is now.  Look forward to seeing him on the trail.
Coming back to New Hampshire next week including speaking at my old high school in Exeter. If you are in the area come on by!   
Thanks Dave - appreciate the chance to make the case.  👍 
 Thank you Mary.  👍
Unless the Knicks have a back channel deal with Kevin Durant and Kyrie this trade is the worst thing I have ever seen.
