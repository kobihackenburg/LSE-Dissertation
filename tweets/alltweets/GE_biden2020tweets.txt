Decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance.I'm going to make sure you get that. You haven't been getting it the last four years. 
Donald Trump is the most racist president in modern history. 
You know who I am. You know who Donald Trump is. The character of the country is on the ballot. 
There is institutional racism in America.We have to give everyone a fair shot. 
Kids were ripped from their parents‚Äô arms, and now they can't find their parents.Those kids are alone. With nowhere to go.It‚Äôs criminal. 
Donald Trump has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn.
You know who I am. You know who he is.The character of the country is on the ballot. Look at us closely.
Equality and justice ‚Äî the American creed. We have never lived up to it, but we‚Äôve never stopped trying ‚Äî until this President.
Call it Bidencare. 
This isn‚Äôt about Donald Trump‚Äôs family or my family. This is about your family.Families across America are hurting ‚Äî but that‚Äôs the last thing Donald Trump wants to talk about. 
All Donald Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street.He thinks the economy is doing well if the Dow Jones is doing well.Believe it or not, Mr. President, most Americans don't live off the stock market.
He‚Äôs a confused guy. He doesn‚Äôt know who he‚Äôs running against. He‚Äôs running against Joe Biden.
We‚Äôve been waiting years for President Trump to reveal his grand plan for health care, and he still has nothing to show.I‚Äôve laid out exactly what I‚Äôll do. Take a look: 
I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them.What is Donald Trump hiding? 
It‚Äôs not about his family or my family. It‚Äôs about your family.If you‚Äôre a middle-class family right now, you‚Äôre hurting badly.
Malarkey!
I don‚Äôt see our country in terms of blue states and red states. We are the United States. 
Donald Trump should release his tax returns or shut up about corruption.

Folks, the final debate is here. Tune in at 9 PM ET as I go head-to-head with Donald Trump for the last time before Election Day.
Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.I see it from where I came from: Scranton, Pennsylvania. It's why I'll fight every day as president to make this country work for the middle class ‚Äî not the wealthy and well-connected.
I‚Äôm running as a proud Democrat. But I will be an American president.
I‚Äôm always talking about my plans to build back better for all Americans. But what does that really mean for you and your family? Watch as helps explain: 
On this International Stuttering Awareness Day, I want everyone to remember that the barriers you face don't define who you are. They didn't for me ‚Äì‚Äì as a young boy who stuttered ‚Äì‚Äì and they certainly don't for Brayden.What defines you is your heart and your courage.

Mr. President, the people are tired. They‚Äôre tired of your lies about this virus. They‚Äôre tired of watching more Americans die, and more people lose their jobs because you refuse to take this pandemic seriously. 
Waving a white flag and saying, ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù is unacceptable when thousands are dying each week, when businesses are closing, and when schools remain shuttered. The American people have never backed down from a challenge, but they need a leader to show the way.

I helped pull this country out of a recession before ‚Äî and, as president, I‚Äôll do it again.
In January, I said President Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis. And everything we‚Äôve been through in the months since has proven that to be true. 
When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, "it is what it is."It is what it is?This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful.
Today we join Polish-Americans in celebrating General Pulaski, whose heroism built the American cavalry and saved the life of George Washington. America will always stand with the Polish people against the common threats we face.

There is no excuse for President Trump‚Äôs reckless behavior. 
One in five small businesses have closed.More than 25 million Americans are on unemployment.Millions are at risk of losing their homes.But President Trump doesn‚Äôt seem to care. He only cares about how he and his wealthy friends are doing.
America has to be about the possibilities of prosperity. Not just for the privileged few. But for the many ‚Äî for all of us.
The fact is this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our already broken mental health care system.We can and must do better.As president, I‚Äôll fight to achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma.

Let‚Äôs go vote, America. 
We need a president who understands hardworking Americans ‚Äî not one who looks down on them.
What does building back better mean for you?- Millions of new, good-paying jobs- A $15 federal minimum wage- Stronger benefits and fair workplaces- An economy that works for everyone‚Äînot just the wealthy- The choice to join a unionThat's the future we can build together.

I give you my word: If I am elected president, I will marshal the ingenuity and goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together.

We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.And by fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation.Those better angels must prevail again.
The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn‚Äôt care where you live or what political party you belong to.It infects us all. It will take anyone‚Äôs life. It is a virus ‚Äî not a political weapon.
I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America.

Donald Trump showed the country last night just how unfit he is to be president. If you weren't able to bear watching it, we condensed it down to one minute for you: 
I took the Amtrak from Wilmington to Washington, D.C., every day for 36 years. The journey became routine, but the hardworking men and women I met along the way became dear friends. 
Enough with the racist dog whistles, Donald. You wouldn‚Äôt know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.

We're in Alliance, Ohio, for stop two of the Build Back Better Express Tour. Tune in now to watch. 
All aboard! Tune in as and I kick off our train tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
Had enough? 
There‚Äôs no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night. 
Folks, we don't have to put up with four more years of that. 
This. This is Donald Trump's America. 
After tonight, the choice in this election has never been clearer ‚Äî and with 35 days to go, the stakes have never been higher. Tomorrow marks our final end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal.Chip in to help beat Donald Trump: 
You heard a lot come out of President Trump‚Äôs mouth. Can you name one thing he said to actually make your life better?
You have it in your control to determine what this country‚Äôs gonna look like the next four years. Is it going to change ‚Äì‚Äì or are you going to get four more years of these lies? 
We need a president who will bring us together ‚Äî not tear us further apart. 
You determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote. 
Under this president, we have become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession, I was asked to fix it, and I did.We left Donald Trump a booming economy, and he caused a recession. 
Go to: 
Under this president, we‚Äôve become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent.
Beau Biden was not a loser. 
Donald Trump isn't a law and order president. He's a president who breaks the law and creates disorder.
Donald Trump talks a lot about the art of the deal. But under his watch, China has perfected the art of the steal. 
  wants to cut health care for millions during a global pandemic. Seems accurate. 
 ‚ÄúWill you shut up, man.‚Äù  
More jobs were created in the final three years of the Obama-Biden Administration than in the first three years of Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency. A million and a half more jobs. 
On average, roughly 750 to 1,000 Americans are dying from COVID every day.When Donald Trump was presented with that number, he said, ‚ÄúIt is what it is.‚ÄùIt is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is. 
Show us your tax returns,
Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had.
When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones.It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad.
It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.
The American people deserve to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. 
President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he‚Äôs in Court trying to rip their protections away.And now, he‚Äôs trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done.We can‚Äôt let him win.
I‚Äôm about to step on stage to debate Donald Trump for the first time. But before I do, can you chip in to show him the power of our grassroots base? Every donation ‚Äî big or small ‚Äî goes a long way. 
This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue ‚Äî and with your help, Scranton will win. 
It‚Äôs debate night, so I‚Äôve got my earpiece and performance enhancers ready. 
Folks, the big night is finally here. Tune in at 9 PM ET for the first presidential debate. 
If we‚Äôre elected, and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class. For Main Street. For the folks who keep our country running.We‚Äôre going to make our government work for everyone ‚Äî not just the wealthy and well-connected.
You deserve a president who tells you the truth. 
It‚Äôs grassroots donors like you who power our campaign. And I‚Äôm counting on you to help us meet our end-of-quarter fundraising goal.If you‚Äôre able, please chip in before tomorrow night‚Äôs big deadline: 
The American people deserve transparency from their leaders, it's why as of today, I've released 22 years of my tax returns. 
 Truth ‚Äî and we can‚Äôt stress this enough, folks ‚Äî over lies 
With casualties rapidly mounting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trump Administration needs to call the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. It must also demand others ‚Äî like Turkey ‚Äî stay out of this conflict. 
The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance.But Donald Trump doesn't care ‚Äî he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions.It's unconscionable.
I believe there's no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people ‚Äî and I witnessed it firsthand last week in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.Together, we're going to make sure the future is made here in America. 
Folks, this is a big week for our campaign: Tomorrow, I face Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time ‚Äî and Wednesday is our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline.We can't afford to fall short here. Chip in today: 
 is right: Your vote is your voice ‚Äî and it‚Äôs up to all of us to make our voices heard this November.Make your plan to vote today:  
I'm not looking to punish anyone, but it's about time the super-wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share.
Whether it's $7.50, $75, or $750 ‚Äî every donation makes a big difference during this final stretch.Chip in to help us get Donald Trump out of the White House: 
President Trump can claim he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions all he wants ‚Äî but the fact is he‚Äôs fighting tooth and nail to take their protections away.
 American people deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to the next justice who serves on the Supreme Court. Tun‚Ä¶
How much more did you pay in taxes than President Trump?Head to  to find out. 
Here's the deal: Until we deal with COVID-19, we'll never get our economy fully back on track, get our kids safely back to school, or get our lives back.It's why as president, I won't waste a day getting this virus under control. 
There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years ‚Äî and now they see an opening to get it done.We can't let them get away with it.
 Teachers paid $7,239Firefighters paid $5,283Nurses paid $10,216Donald Trump paid $750 
On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, Jill and I are keeping the loved ones of our fallen heroes in our prayers. May we never fail to honor them and carry their spirit with us every day.

The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court affect our everyday lives ‚Äî and the American people deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to who serves on the Court. Tune in as I deliver remarks on President Trump‚Äôs nomination. 
These folks know that we can‚Äôt saddle this country with four more years of Donald Trump. 
Thank you for your support at this critical moment for our nation.You said it best: This election is about earning the respect of the American people. It‚Äôs about decency. It‚Äôs about electing leaders who tell the truth.Thanks again, DJ. Next time we‚Äôre talking cars. 
In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare.Health care is at stake. Protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake.We can't let them win. 
The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.
Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions.The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.Americans deserve to be heard.
Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court ‚Äî a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court‚Äôs decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act.Vote like your health care is on the ballot ‚Äî because it is. 
When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus.After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously "disappear."Now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short.It's a national tragedy.
 NEW AD: Meet Samantha ; her daughter Josephine, one of the millions of families threatened by Trump‚Äôs failed coronavirus re‚Ä¶
At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.We need a president who believes in science.
Today is Public Lands Day and National Hunting and Fishing Day ‚Äî and what better way to celebrate than the long overdue removal of William Perry Pendley from It's a victory for everyone who values our public lands over those who want to exploit them for profit. 
If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19.Minutes after the race is called, I‚Äôll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on.During my transition, I‚Äôll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.We will overcome this, together.
Thanks for a great trip, Minnesota! Don‚Äôt forget that early voting is now open across the state. Head to  to make your plan to vote today. 
Today, Justice Ginsburg made history one last time ‚Äî and I was grateful to be there to pay my respects. May her memory be a blessing ‚Äî and may we continue to be voices for justice in her name. 
The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us.It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating.It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office ‚Äî to care, for everyone.
We are in the middle of a climate emergency ‚Äî and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet.We have to vote him out. 
Obamacare was‚Äîand is‚Äîa big deal. As president, I‚Äôll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give Americans the opportunity to choose a new public option.We‚Äôre going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need. 
Health care is a right ‚Äî not a privilege.
In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.Don't forget that.
Thank you, Your support and your friendship mean the world to me. John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward ‚Äî it's what I'll do every day as president. 
I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week.Now, the Senate and President Trump need to reauthorize VAWA. It's long overdue. 
Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better.
The Trump Administration says "the entire ACA must fall."They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic.We can't let him win. 
In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow.
Michigan ‚Äî You don‚Äôt have to wait until November 3rd to cast your ballot, early voting begins today across the state.It's easy and it's important: head to  to make your plan to vote early.

We are a more just, more equal nation because of Justice Ginsburg. Now it‚Äôs up to all of us to carry on her fight. 
Even amidst the profound grief ; anger today's decision generated, violence is never ; can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill ; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift ; full recovery.
The 200,000 people we've lost to COVID-19 weren't nobodies, Mr. President.They were our parents and grandparents, sons and daughters, friends and co-workers.They were Americans. 
As Juan Guaid√≥ speaks about the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis and the crimes against humanity perpetrated by Maduro, I reaffirm my commitment to stand with the Venezuelan people.A Biden-Harris administration will always champion democracy and human rights around the world. 
We must continue to speak Breonna Taylor‚Äôs name, support her family still in grieving, and never give up on ensuring the full promise of America for every American.

Let me be very clear, Not a single one of the 200,000 Americans we've lost to this virus was a "nobody."

Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.I see the world from where I grew up: Scranton, Pennsylvania.
It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. 
200,000 Americans have died from this virus.It‚Äôs a staggering number that‚Äôs hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.There‚Äôs a devastating human toll to this pandemic ‚Äî and we can‚Äôt forget that.
While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing.Now, nearly 200,000 Americans have died.It didn‚Äôt have to happen this way. 
Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost.Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you.Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith.
Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country ‚Äî and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.
When the virus came, President Trump wasn‚Äôt thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.It‚Äôs how Trump looks at the world: It‚Äôs always about him, never about us.You deserve a president who will put you first.
Thank you for the warm welcome, Manitowoc! With the help of companies like Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry, we're going to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made here in America. 
In this moment, we're facing both a public health crisis and an economic crisis because Donald Trump failed to do his job. I'm in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to discuss what I'll do to get our nation back on track. Tune in. 
If this reporting is true, this complaint is deeply concerning and needs to be independently investigated immediately. These women are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Practices like this would end in a Biden Administration. 
Let me be clear: LGBTQ+ rights are human rights ‚Äî and ‚ÄúLGBT-free zones‚Äù have no place in the European Union or anywhere in the world. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was proof that courage, conviction, and moral clarity can change not just the law ‚Äî but also the world. 
On the third anniversary of Hurricane Maria, it‚Äôs not enough to just remember the devastation wrought by the storm. We must act to ensure nothing like it ever happens again and to ensure Puerto Rico gets the full dignity and respect it deserves. 
En el tercer aniversario del hurac√°n Mar√≠a, no es suficiente recordar la devastaci√≥n provocada por la tormenta. Debemos actuar para asegurarnos de que nada como esto vuelva a suceder y asegurar que Puerto Rico reciba la dignidad y el respeto que se merece.

Tune in as I deliver remarks on the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the future of the Supreme Court. 
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the future of the Supreme Court. 
Honor and decency are on the ballot this November. 
It was my honor to preside over Justice Ginsburg‚Äôs confirmation hearings, and to support her accession to the Supreme Court. Her opinions, and her dissents, will shape the basis of our law for generations to come ‚Äî and we‚Äôll be a more just and equal nation because of it. 
I‚Äôm Joe Biden and I approve this message. 
We must win.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights ‚Äî affecting generations to come. Vote. Our future depends on it. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life‚Äôs work, we are closer to that more perfect union we‚Äôve always strived to be. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us all. 
Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.
Jill and I wish our friends in the Jewish community a very healthy and happy New Year. As we mark this new beginning, let us commit to pursuing peace and justice in the year ahead. 
Amy is right: our democracy depends on your vote. And you don't have to wait until November to cast your ballot.If you're in Minnesota, head to  and make your plan to vote today. 
Now, it's time to vote. Make your plan today.  
Let's be honest: my campaign wouldn't be here if it weren't for the support of Black Americans. And I know we don't have a chance to win without your support.I'll do everything I can to earn your vote‚Äîand together, we'll build a nation that works for all.  
Virginia ‚Äî early voting is now open! The future of our country is on the ballot, and your voice is absolutely critical to deciding who we are as a nation. This is our moment. Head to  to make a plan to vote. Democracy depends on it. 
Frankie ‚Äî I'm honored to have your support and couldn't agree more: We are at our best when we act as one America. Together, we're going to unite the country and restore the soul of the nation. 
A Biden-Harris administration will create millions of good-paying, union jobs and ensure the future is made in America ‚Äî by all of America. I‚Äôm speaking live from Hermantown, MN on how we‚Äôll get it done. Tune in. 
I can't believe I have to say this, but if I'm elected president, I won't put a climate change denier ‚Äî one who called the scientific community "a bunch of thugs" ‚Äî in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.It's unforgivable.
Donald Trump claimed he would be "the greatest jobs president God ever created."But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. 
 The Black community understands just how critical this election is‚Äîbecause we are living the consequences of the last ele‚Ä¶
Folks, I just wrapped up my first CNN Town Hall of the general election. We‚Äôre in the home stretch of this campaign and your support matters more than ever.Chip in to help us keep tonight‚Äôs momentum going: 
What the hell makes you think I need an Ivy League degree to be president?  
Unlike President Trump, I‚Äôll be a president for all Americans ‚Äî not just the ones who vote for me.  
Here's the deal: I've condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is. President Trump has not.  
As president, I will bring Americans together and finally deliver much needed policing reform.  
You lost your freedom because President Trump didn't act.  
I‚Äôm in this race to fight for the hardworking Americans who wake up every single day and make our country run.  
I'll tell you what takes away your freedom: not being able to see your kid, go to the football game, or see your mom or dad in the hospital. That's what is costing us our freedom.  
The choice in this election couldn‚Äôt be more clear.We can choose four more years of Donald Trump‚Äôs dark and divisive politics.Or we can choose a path of hope and light‚Äîand build a better future for all.Chip in to help us win.  
This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue.
President Trump knew how deadly COVID-19 was and did nothing. It‚Äôs close to criminal.  
I‚Äôm about to take the stage for tonight‚Äôs Town Hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Tune in to now to watch live. 
Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans.We need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected.
I‚Äôm looking forward to being back in my home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for tonight‚Äôs CNN Town Hall. Tune in at 8 PM ET to watch. 
No surprise, Donald Trump is lying about my tax plan. Here‚Äôs the truth about how I‚Äôll make corporations pay their fair share while ensuring Americans making under $400,000 don‚Äôt pay a penny more. 
Ahead of  Jill and I want to wish everyone in the Jewish community a very happy, healthy, and sweet New Year. Tune in to our virtual event: 
The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis. Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break. Let that sink in.
If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share ‚Äî and we'll invest that money in working families.We're going to reward work ‚Äî not wealth.
 the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it. 
We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing.  We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.The stakes are too high.
Yesterday, I met with some of our nation's top experts to discuss how we distribute a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. If I win this election, I know that there won't be a minute to waste. I'll get to work on day one implementing an effective distribution plan. 
President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end "quickly" if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking.As president, I promise I'll take action to end this epidemic. 
If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if more of America is ablaze? 
We‚Äôre going to get this virus under control and get your life back on track.
This is Donald Trump‚Äôs America after one term. Why would we give him a second? 
When I said I trust vaccines, and I trust the scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump ‚Äî this is what I meant: 
We can‚Äôt allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit.Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period. 
We all want a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, but it needs to be based on science ‚Äî not politics. Tune in as I discuss how we can develop and equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine: 
We‚Äôve lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19. It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad ‚Äî but Donald Trump failed to do his job.
The fact of the matter is Donald Trump doesn't have a health care plan.I do ‚Äî and you can read it here:  
Science will win. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs climate denial may not have directly caused the record fires we‚Äôre seeing on the West Coast. But if he gets four more years in the White House, they‚Äôll only become more common, devastating, and deadly. 
To be clear: I am not currently president. But if you chip in now, we can change that in November:  
Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. No matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. That's the story of America ‚Äî and it is well worth celebrating. 
Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico ‚Äî but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable.As president, I'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future.
Today marks the official start of Hispanic Heritage Month. Tune in as we kick off our celebration from Florida: 
As we celebrate the Independence Day of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, we must affirm the democratic aspirations and human rights of people across Latin America.I'll always fight for democracy and for those who come to America seeking a better life.
The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election. As we honor the memory of those four little girls, we must commit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse 57 years ago.
I believe that every American deserves a fair shot to get ahead and a government that treats them equally. But that hasn't been the case for the people of Puerto Rico. Today, I'm releasing my new plan to change that: 
For months, President Trump has failed to provide desperately needed fiscal relief to our state and local governments ‚Äî and we‚Äôre seeing the consequences every day.Our students and educators deserve better.As president, I‚Äôll make sure they always have the resources they need. 
The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by those who defend our nation at war. I‚Äôm in Tampa, Florida, to hear from veterans and to discuss how I‚Äôll honor that promise as president. Tune in: 
 Our planet can‚Äôt afford four more years of Donald Trump. Together, and I will take immediate action to tackle t‚Ä¶
Wheels up, folks. 
Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for his failed response and for lying to the American people. 
This morning, parents all across the West ‚Äî already worried about their kids being indoors because of COVID-19 ‚Äî are now also waking up worried about their kids being outside.We need a president who takes climate change seriously.
The fact is, Iran is closer to a nuclear bomb today than it was when Donald Trump took office.Every day he‚Äôs in charge of our national security is another day our enemies are emboldened and the American people are at risk. 
When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù I think ‚Äújobs.‚ÄùGood paying, union jobs that put Americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation. 
 you know what‚Äôs actually threatening our suburbs?Wildfires. Floods. Hurricanes.We need to act on climate. Now.
Science knows. 
Folks, it all comes down to this. We have just 50 days until the most important election of our lifetimes.Make a plan to have your voice heard this November. 
Amy Poehler and know a thing or two about and ‚Äî and I can't wait to see what they have in store for tonight's grassroots fundraiser.Chip in now to reserve your ticket:  
Climate change is the existential challenge that will define our future as a country. Tune in as I discuss the wildfires up and down the West Coast ‚Äî and how I'll tackle the climate crisis head-on and create millions of good-paying jobs: 
50 days until Election Day. 50 days to do everything we can to make Donald Trump a one-term president.Chip in to power our campaign through this final stretch: 
50 days.
Weapons of war have no place in our communities.We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
When President Trump talks about America leading the world, this is what he means. 
I know we can beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better ‚Äî but we need your help to do it. That's why we're launching our new Grassroots Fundraising Team.Sign up and help us win this November. 
I promise that as president, I‚Äôll make reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act a top priority and continue working to end gender-based violence. 
With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger.The latest bill‚Äîpassed by the House last year‚Äîwould close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women.But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It‚Äôs despicable.
26 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence.Writing and championing the law remains one of my proudest accomplishments. 
It's hard to believe, but Monday marks 50 days until Election Day. To kick off the final stretch, and are hosting a grassroots fundraiser.You won't want to miss this, folks. Chip in to reserve your spot: 
26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines‚Äîit was an effort I was proud to champion.These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire.As president, I‚Äôll take on the and we‚Äôll ban them once again.
This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.Jill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery. 
In a Biden-Harris administration, ‚ÄúBuy American‚Äù will be more than a slogan. We‚Äôre going to invest an additional $400 billion in purchasing American-made products and keep good-paying jobs here at home. 
Donald Trump and I have pretty different philosophies when it comes to giving our word. Mine means something. When I tell the American people I‚Äôm going to do something ‚Äî I follow through. 
I promise you that if I‚Äôm elected president, I‚Äôll never forget what the job is about. It‚Äôs about you ‚Äî the American people. 
Iran‚Äôs cruel execution of Navid Afkari is a travesty. No country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists. Iran must free its other political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained Americans. 
As president, I‚Äôll impose a tax penalty on companies that ship jobs overseas and sell products back to the U.S. ‚Äî and I‚Äôll create millions of good-paying jobs here at home.We‚Äôre going to make sure the future is made in America ‚Äî by all of America's workers. 
The science is clear, and deadly signs like the fires out West are unmistakable ‚Äî climate change poses an existential threat to our way of life.We must act now to avoid a future defined by tragedies like the one American families are enduring today. 
You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better.I promise that‚Äôs exactly what and I will do.
Always remember. 
And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation ‚Äî so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.
Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service.
This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss ‚Äî a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans.
Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country. 
As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does ‚Äî unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it. 
Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.
More than 1,000 people died from COVID yesterday watched eight hours of TV.If I‚Äôm president, you might not always agree with me. But I promise you I will always show up and fight for you. 
Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today‚Äîwhile also refusing to fully fund their National Guard.These are frontline workers against COVID-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies.Michiganders need a pandemic response‚Äînot a pep rally. 
Do your part. Wear a mask. 
Make no mistake: Climate change is already here ‚Äî and we‚Äôre witnessing its devastating effects every single day. We have to get President Trump out of the White House and treat this crisis like the existential threat that it is. 
To everyone struggling right now, I want you to know that you are not alone. You‚Äôre seen, you‚Äôre heard, and you‚Äôre loved. If you need help, please don‚Äôt hesitate to visit  Better days lie ahead, I promise. 
The images coming out of California, Oregon, Washington, and other Western states are truly horrifying. If you‚Äôre in an impacted area, please heed the warnings from your local authorities and stay safe. Jill and I are keeping you all in our prayers. 
How many more people have to suffer because of President Trump's lies? 
Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.
I got to meet Lou Brock back in March. I joked that I had really just come to St. Louis to see him‚Äîand let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. Lou was a true legend and a man of integrity. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time. 
Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it.Now, nearly 200,000 Americans are dead.It‚Äôs unconscionable. 
You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action ‚Äî costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.It‚Äôs an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him.I may be a Phillies fan, but I‚Äôm always proud to honor the legacy of  
I promise you that if I‚Äôm elected, I‚Äôll always tell you the truth.I‚Äôll listen to the experts and do everything I can to contain this virus.And I‚Äôll always put your health and safety first ‚Äî no matter the political cost.
Donald Trump knew.He lied to us for months.And while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job ‚Äî on purpose.It was a life or death betrayal of the American people. 
I‚Äôm in Warren, Michigan, to discuss how a Biden-Harris administration will ensure the future is made in America ‚Äî by America‚Äôs workers. Tune in now: 
The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is ‚Äî exercise it. Make your voice heard this November. 
 The images we‚Äôre seeing from the West Coast are absolutely horrifying. I‚Äôm eternally grateful for our brave firefighters‚Ä¶
President Obama and I rescued the auto industry and helped Michigan's economy come roaring back.Donald Trump squandered it ‚Äî and hardworking Michiganders are paying the price every day. 
Given his track record, no one can take Trump‚Äôs word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. 
3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics? President Trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every American ‚Äî not just the wealthy and well-connected ‚Äî receives the vaccine.
2: Who will validate that the Administration‚Äôs decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation? We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from the vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.
1: What criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy?The FDA must clarify what criteria it will use, and President Trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the FDA.
A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible.But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool.Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:
Donald Trump is incapable of providing the leadership this moment requires.
 Let me tell you about Joe. 
Every single American worker deserves the chance to join a union. As president, I‚Äôll strengthen our labor unions and ensure workers can bargain for the pay, benefits, and workplace protections they deserve. 
I can tell you few people know me as well as and do. 
Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida. Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable. You don't have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling. 
On this feast day of Cuba‚Äôs patron saint la Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Jill and I pray that the love and compassion ‚ÄúCachita‚Äù inspires will fill the hearts of Cubans and believers around the world. 
Unlike Donald Trump, I'll listen to the experts and heed their advice ‚Äî especially when it comes to matters of health and safety.You should expect nothing less from your president. 
This economy may be working great for Donald Trump and his wealthy friends ‚Äî but it's not working for the rest of America.It's time we change that.
At our best, America has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. We treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind.I believe we can be that nation once again.
Mr. President ‚Äî If you‚Äôre so good at making deals, then why does your trade deal cost American workers so much pain while letting China off the hook for its biggest trade abuses? 
As president, I‚Äôll make record investments in American industry and create millions of good-paying, union jobs.We‚Äôre going to make sure the future is made in America ‚Äî and built by union workers. 
Wall Street didn't build this country ‚Äî the middle class did. And unions built the middle class.Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.
It's not enough to just thank our essential workers ‚Äî we need to pay them. As president, I‚Äôll:- Raise the minimum wage to $15- End the tipped minimum wage- End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities- Ensure everyone has strong benefits
For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. It will end on my watch.I'll sign the PRO Act ‚Äî making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain ‚Äî and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
Together, we can build a future that reflects working people‚Äôs courage and ambition. One that not only offers good jobs ‚Äî but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity, and common purpose due to every American. 
The 40-hour workweekMinimum wageOvertime payHealth care Workplace safety protectionsThey‚Äôre all because of unions ‚Äî and it‚Äôs time we recognize that.
Today, we honor the generations of union workers who fought for the rights, power, wages, and benefits that built and sustained the great American middle class.  
We need to restore honor and decency to the White House.
Time and again, the president has refused to provide Puerto Rico with much-needed resources. He‚Äôs repeatedly insulted Puerto Ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island. This ends when I‚Äôm elected president. 
Donald Trump promised to be "the greatest jobs president God ever created."But in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered.American workers can't take four more years of his failed leadership.
We all want our schools to reopen ‚Äî but we need to do it in a way that puts the health and safety of our students and educators first.Here's how and I will reopen our schools safely and effectively: 
We know what President Trump thinks of our nation's veterans. Here is what they think of him. 
It‚Äôs time we reward work ‚Äî not just wealth.
Be a patriot. Wear a mask. 
The economy wasn‚Äôt working for folks long before this virus hit. That‚Äôs why and I won‚Äôt just build back to the way things were ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to build back better.We‚Äôre going to make sure everyone has a fair shot to get ahead. 
As president, I will:- Call for nationwide mask mandates- Implement widespread testing- Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccinesI‚Äôm ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.
Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. Instead, they‚Äôre being deported back into the tyrannical grip of Daniel Ortega without a chance to pursue their claims.President Trump‚Äôs cruelty truly knows no bounds. 
Mr. President, enough with the weekend golf trips and erratic tweets. It's time for you to get to work and control the spread of this virus. 
Our nation‚Äôs veterans speak for themselves. 
Every day Donald Trump proves how morally unfit he is to lead our nation.In 60 days, we have to vote him out. 
Now is not the time for a victory lap, Mr. President. Just because your wealthy friends and donors are doing well doesn't mean everyone else is.Get off the golf course. Call the leaders of Congress to the White House. And make a deal that delivers for working people.
The fact is we're more than six months into this pandemic, and:- 11.5 million Americans don't have their jobs back- Almost 30 million are on unemployment- We're down 720,000 manufacturing jobs- Nearly 1 in 6 small businesses have closed their doors
I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope ‚Äî but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report.The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June.
Tune in as I discuss how our economic crisis has been worsened by President Trump's failure to get COVID-19 under control: 
 Every day we are thankful for our veterans and fallen soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom und‚Ä¶
Mr. President, if you don‚Äôt respect our troops, you can‚Äôt lead them. 
Here‚Äôs my promise to you: If I have the honor of serving as the next commander in chief, I will ensure that our American heroes know that I will have their back and honor their sacrifice. Always. 
In 2016, President Trump promised to reduce the trade deficit and said: "You will see a drop like you've never seen before."The reality? It's the highest it's been in 12 years.American workers can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. 
The President has a duty to set an example.  
Folks, today marks two months until Election Day. That means we have just two months to do everything we can to beat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation.Chip in to help us win in November: 
This is our moment to root out systemic racism and ensure justice finally rings out for all in America. 
We need a president who will work to lower the temperature ‚Äî not raise it. A president who will bring people together and find solutions to the challenges we face.That's what I went to Kenosha to do today, and it's what I'll do every day in the White House. 
It‚Äôs time we come together as a nation to heal and address the challenges we face. Tune in to our community conversation in Kenosha, Wisconsin: 
Right now, classrooms should be humming with excitement for a new year and students‚Äô hopes for their futures.Instead, many are silent and empty because President Trump didn‚Äôt do his job.America‚Äôs families are paying the price for his failures.
I've always believed we're at our best when we act as one America. It's time for us to come together, propel our nation across this turbulent threshold, and build a better future for all.
Time and time again, President Trump has refused to stand up to Putin. His silence on the poisoning of Mr. Navalny is just the latest example.As president, I'll do what Trump won't: hold the Putin regime accountable for its crimes. 
I‚Äôve released 21 years of my tax returns. What are you hiding, 
They're rooting for chaos and violence because they think it helps them win a second term.Now ask yourself, is that really who you think should be running the country? 
If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, our planet may never recover. 
We‚Äôre just over two months from Election Day. But in many states, you don‚Äôt have to wait until November to make your voice heard.Head to  and make a plan to vote early today.
Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are the worst possible people to lead our nation‚Äôs schools through this pandemic.
We all want students back in the classroom, but President Trump hasn't done the work to make sure schools can reopen safely and effectively and I will be ready on day 1 with a roadmap for reopening. 
President Trump has failed to address COVID-19 ‚Äî and now our students and educators are paying the price. Tune in as I discuss my plan to safely and effectively reopen schools: 
This campaign is powered by grassroots supporters like you ‚Äî and every dollar counts to close the fundraising gap with the Trump campaign. $5, $10, $15, whatever you can, chip in today: 
Last month we raised $364.5 million ‚Äî 95% of the donations from grassroots supporters like you and the majority online.Working people are powering our campaign ‚Äî and I‚Äôm grateful.We‚Äôve got a long way to go to close the fundraising gap and win ‚Äî but we can do it. Together.
Donald Trump is determined to instill fear and divide us, but what he doesn't understand is that fear never builds the future ‚Äî hope does. 
For far too long, discriminatory policies like redlining have kept Black Americans from having the same opportunities as white Americans.That‚Äôs got to change:  
If I‚Äôm elected president, I promise you that America will be better prepared to deal with any threats that come our way.That starts with restoring the PREDICT program that President Trump ended. 
Together, we‚Äôre going to build back better than before and set our nation on a new path. 
 and I send our best wishes to members of the Jain faith concluding the holy observance of Paryushan and Das Lakshan. May we all find peace and reconciliation in our lives. Michhami Dukkaddam and Kshamavani!
We need a president who will lower the temperature and bring the country together ‚Äî not one who raises it and tears us further apart. 
 Can you believe?! ‚ú® and the  are doing a grassroots fundraiser happening NOW! Join us ‚¨áÔ∏è
Our nation is at an inflection point. and I sat down to discuss what brought us to this moment ‚Äî and how we move forward and build back better than before. Tune in to watch: 
Across the country, people rely on public transportation to get to work, see loved ones, and access essential services. But that's all under threat because Republicans refuse to do their jobs.Congress must act now to save public transit.
 Tonight is our August fundraising deadline, and we need your help to make sure we finish strong.We can't do this alone -- ev‚Ä¶
Today‚Äôs press conference made it clear: we are all less safe because Donald Trump has failed at his job.We need a President who will stop violence ‚Äî not incite it. 
President Shri Pranab Mukherjee was a devout public servant who believed deeply in the importance of our two nations tackling global challenges together. Jill and I are saddened to hear of his passing ‚Äî our prayers go out to his loved ones and the Indian people. 
I urge President Trump to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is an important right ‚Äî violence is wrong. Period.If he can‚Äôt say that, then he is unfit to be President. 
Tonight, President Trump declined to rebuke violence.He wouldn‚Äôt even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder.He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it.
Fear never builds the future ‚Äî hope does. 
If Donald Trump wants to ask the question: Who will keep you safer as President?Let‚Äôs answer it. 
Donald Trump looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline.He failed to protect America, so now he's trying to scare America. 
Folks, we're just hours away from our first end-of-month fundraising deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal and show Donald Trump we have what it takes to win in November.If you're able, please chip in today: 
The truth is Donald Trump can't stop the violence, because for years he has fomented it. 
Anyone who met Amari will tell you that he was a charismatic young man‚Äîpoised for greatness. He was ready and willing to take on the world. I can tell you that in 20 years, we all would have been saying, ‚ÄòAmari for President.‚Äô  
More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed.Do you really feel safer under Trump?
Mr. President, it‚Äôs high time you condemn violence of any form. 
Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe.Well, he is president ‚Äî whether he knows it or not.
Trump and Pence are running on this: ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be safe in Joe Biden‚Äôs America.‚ÄùAnd what‚Äôs their proof?The violence you‚Äôre seeing in Donald Trump‚Äôs America.
The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now, he‚Äôs trying to scare America.
I want a safe America ‚Äî safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. And let‚Äôs be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump.
Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.
Donald Trump can‚Äôt stop the violence we're seeing today ‚Äì because for years he has fomented it.  Tune in as I discuss the need for justice and safety in America: 
Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump: COVID.Economic devastation.Unwarranted police violence.Emboldened white nationalists.A reckoning on race.Declining faith in a bright American future.The common thread? A president who makes things worse ‚Äî not better.
We‚Äôre going to build back better and we will do it while creating a brighter future for you and your families. This week and I sit down to discuss how we are going to move forward‚Äîtogether.Join us on Tuesday. 
There‚Äôs a lot happening, but I hope we don‚Äôt overlook the brave fire fighters ; emergency responders in the wake of Hurricane Laura.When the storm hit, they stayed behind‚Äîeven while their homes were being destroyed‚Äîto help their community recover.True American heroes.
This video is doctored ‚Äî and a flagrant attempt to spread misinformation at the expense of a man who uses assistive technology. It should be removed. Now. 
I‚Äôm thrilled to announce our grassroots fundraiser with our friends. I hope you‚Äôll join and this Tuesday.Chip in to reserve your spot:  
Donald Trump has been president for almost four years.The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper.And all of us are less safe because he can‚Äôt do the job of the American president.
We must not become a country at war with ourselves.A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another.But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.
The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable.I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same. 
We run this campaign led by the values that guide my life - honesty, integrity, and compassion. and I are hard at work and want to let you into the conversation.Join us this Tuesday. 
No lies, fear-mongering, or malarkey.Just an honest conversation about the future of our nation.Tune in this Tuesday. 
I believe we're so much better than what we saw this week at the RNC.This is our moment to choose love over hate, hope over fear, fact over fiction.We'll overcome this era of American darkness, together. 
I don‚Äôt know a single person who believes any part of this pandemic has been a ‚Äúgood thing".Secretary DeVos and President Trump refuse to take this virus seriously‚Äîour children are paying the price.
I believe there's not a single thing the American people can't accomplish if we do it together. We're going to overcome these crises and emerge stronger than before.
Folks, we‚Äôre just a few days away from our biggest end-of-month deadline yet and we need your help to hit our goal. Every donation ‚Äî big or small ‚Äî makes a big difference.Please chip in today: 
The only thing this president has done alone is fail America. 
We have a president more interested in beating people at golf than beating COVID-19.
I promise you this: A Biden-Harris Administration will always listen to scientists. 
The true power of was bigger than anything we saw on screen. From the Black Panther to Jackie Robinson, he inspired generations and showed them they can be anything they want ‚Äî even super heroes. Jill and I are praying for his loved ones at this difficult time.
America was built on a simple idea: All men ‚Äî and women ‚Äî are created equal. It‚Äôs time we ensured all people are treated equally as well.
The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed COVID response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump‚Äôs America? 
America is at an inflection point.The calls for racial justice that sparked the March on Washington 57 years ago are ringing out again today.As we honor the legacy of that day ‚Äî let's meet this moment with the urgency and action that our heroes marched for half a century ago. 
Donald Trump put our nation on the sidelines. Let‚Äôs get back in the game. 
I know from personal experience how important access to quality, affordable health care is for a family. I know the peace of mind it brings.It's why as president, I promise I'll protect your children's health care as if they were my own. 
As we mark the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, we must continue the hard work of perfecting our union. It's up to all of us to carry on the march toward equality, liberty, and justice for all.
I am grateful for your friendship and leadership, I‚Äôm sad to see you step down, but I know the strong alliance between our countries and peoples will continue for generations to come. Wishing you good health in the years ahead, my friend. 
Mr. President, Americans are canceling weddings and holding funerals without family. They're sacrificing so more Americans don't have to die.But instead of leading by example, you hosted a super spreader event on the South Lawn.When will you take the presidency seriously? 
We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.This is a moment of action.It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer.
Times of crisis often bring out our best as Americans ‚Äî and we're seeing that right now in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. Thank you to all of our emergency responders who are working around the clock to help people get back on their feet. 
Tonight is yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election. Who we are, what we stand for, and who we want to be ‚Äî it's all on the ballot this November.We have to beat Donald Trump. Chip in to help us do it: 
It‚Äôs time we bring integrity back to the White House. 
Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency.
Leadership requires foresight. 
From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.Now, we‚Äôre paying the price.
Donald Trump promised to be the greatest jobs president God ever created.Instead, tens of millions of Americans are out of work and we're facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  
Donald Trump didn't build a wall around America, the world built a wall around us. 
Donald Trump is right, this is the most important election in the history of our country.Chip in to help us get him out of the White House: 
Donald Trump calls himself a wartime president. But now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he‚Äôs waved the white flag.He abandoned the American people when we needed him most.
When President Trump took office, he inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And just like everything else he‚Äôs inherited in his life, he squandered it. 
President Trump has failed our nation. 
- 180,000 lives lost- Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19- Over 25 million Americans out of work- Countless small businesses on the brink of closingThat's Donald Trump's America. We're living it every day. We can't take four more years.
When Donald Trump says tonight you won‚Äôt be safe in Joe Biden‚Äôs America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump‚Äôs America?
This news is deeply disturbing ‚Äî as an alum of and as an American. We need a full and swift investigation into what happened Tuesday night. With anti-Semitism on the rise across the country, we all have a moral obligation to speak out and give hate no safe harbor. 
President Trump doesn‚Äôt want a second term. He wants a do-over.As he takes the stage tonight, remember: he alone is responsible for the chaos in our country.Together, we can stop it. 
Donald Trump and Republicans must have forgotten about the 180,000 American lives lost due to COVID-19.I promise you that, as president, I never will. 
I couldn't be more ready for to be the next Vice President.Chip in to help us make history: 
Immigrants are not your political props, Mr. President. 
Last night, Vice President Mike Pence stood before America and with a straight face said, ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be safe in Joe Biden‚Äôs America.‚ÄùHis proof?The violence you‚Äôre seeing in Donald Trump‚Äôs America. 
And in 146 days, we‚Äôll rejoin it. 
Tune in as discusses President Trump‚Äôs failure to lead on COVID-19 and what a Biden-Harris administration will do differently: 
They got it wrong the first time. They will get it wrong again. 
The cruelty of this president truly knows no bounds. We can‚Äôt let him gut Social Security and eliminate funding for disability benefits. 
To lead America, you have to understand America.I know how hard it is for folks who are sick, struggling, and wondering how they'll get through the day.You deserve a president who will fight for you and lead our nation out of these crises. I'll get started on day one.

Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless.I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need. 
I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.We'll get it done, together.
This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong. Instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with Xi Jinping.I'll put American values back at the center of our foreign policy. 
Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement ‚Äî giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career ‚Äî and I'll continue that fight as president.
Folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. Wear a mask. It‚Äôs not just about you. It‚Äôs about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe. 
Bristol Bay is no place for a mine ‚Äî our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO. 
Donald Trump said that if he‚Äôs re-elected, he‚Äôll defund Social Security.We can't let that happen.
President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable.I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do: 
To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now ‚Äî those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you ‚Äî and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you.
Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump ‚Äî then it's good enough for you and me.
We can‚Äôt let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson ‚Äî reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
Our planet can‚Äôt take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
 We seriously can‚Äôt wait to see who‚Äôs going to join  Text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know when makes‚Ä¶
Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November. 
The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It‚Äôs a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn‚Äôt have gotten this bad.
Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt. 
Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he‚Äôs always wanted ‚Äî the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world. 
It‚Äôs an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I‚Äôve picked as my running mate ‚Äì text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I‚Äôve made my decision.
Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before.
The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime ‚Äî and we're paying the price every single day. 
Our nation is desperate for leadership ‚Äî leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer.
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.
Over the last century, America has defined itself by rising to meet existential challenges ‚Äî and we have that opportunity once again. But we can‚Äôt just build back to the way things were before, we have to build back better.Here‚Äôs my plan for how we‚Äôll do it: 
John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America.Donald Trump will not. 
I can‚Äôt believe I have to say this, but we can‚Äôt let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining.
I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success ‚Äî not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That‚Äôs why as president, I‚Äôll reverse Donald Trump‚Äôs giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.
It didn't have to be this bad. 
Here‚Äôs the truth‚ÄîDonald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans.It's time we pick a different path. 
Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump‚Äôs failure to get this virus under control. 
While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job. 
The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic‚Äîit's obvious he still hasn‚Äôt learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price. 
Here‚Äôs how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump‚ÄîDucey model:- An infection rate‚Äîstill‚Äîof nearly 20%- The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country- More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19- More than 183,000 cases- Lengthy delays in test results
Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.He‚Äôs withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it.He‚Äôs refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk.
President Trump called Arizona ‚Äúa model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.‚Äù He said Governor Ducey‚Äôs approach should be used by other states‚Äîbut here‚Äôs what‚Äôs really happening in Arizona:
My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.
Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place.
Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith‚Äînot by identity, not on issues, not at all.
I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we‚Äôve got to:- Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act- Enact automatic and same-day voter registration- Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts
John Lewis left us with marching orders. It‚Äôs up to all of us to carry them out:  
Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I‚Äôve learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can. 
Let me be clear: Voting is a right ‚Äî not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can‚Äôt be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law. 
55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law ‚Äî bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we‚Äôve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote.
The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict‚Äîand our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used. 
If I'm elected president, our students and educators will have all the tools and resources they need to succeed and get through COVID-19. 
Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector‚Äîand that was true even before COVID-19.I‚Äôll revitalize American manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better. 
Growing up in Scranton, I learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. Those values have guided my entire life ‚Äî and they're the values I'll bring back to the White House. 
Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I‚Äôm announcing my running mate, and I promise I‚Äôll let you know soon. But here‚Äôs what I can tell you right now: I‚Äôm going to tell my supporters first ‚Äî so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know.
I don‚Äôt buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. As president, I'll make bold investments in American manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in America ‚Äî by all of America. 
There's been a lot of talk about my vetting process lately. Here‚Äôs an inside look: 
Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons ‚Äî and as president, I‚Äôll ban these weapons again. 
Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI ‚Äî ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence.
I truly believe that we can revitalize American manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. I want to build an economy that brings everyone along ‚Äî one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected. 
The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it. 
From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action. Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership.
On day one, I‚Äôll send a bill to Congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. It‚Äôs long overdue. 
Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut. I urge both the Trump Administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast.
Thousands of Americans are dying every week. The President's response?"It is what it is." 
I‚Äôll get to work on day one enacting the changes needed to help the Latino community thrive.Read my full plan here:  
Happy birthday to my brother and friend, Serving alongside you for eight years was the greatest honor of my life ‚Äî and I'm grateful to have you by my side for these next 91 days. 
We can‚Äôt just build back to the way things were before these crises. We have to build a more inclusive, equitable future for all.Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll do it:  
The Latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. But even before, many Latino families were already struggling. We've got to do better. That's why today, I'm releasing my new agenda for the Latino community: 
As president, I‚Äôll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic.
One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the and failed to deliver.
On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to "just disappear."He was wrong ‚Äî and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month.Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one.
When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. Period.We‚Äôre going to make sure the future is made in America ‚Äî by all of America: 
Not a joke, folks.Get yours today:  
Every American should be able to safely make their voice heard this November. We need to:- Expand vote-by-mail and early voting- Implement online voter registration- Make it safe and easy to vote in-person
Jill and I mourn the loss of the nine service members who perished in a training accident off the coast of California. These brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their fellow Americans. Our deepest condolences go out to their families.
John Hume committed his life to the principles of nonviolence, and through his faith, statesmanship, and perseverance, he helped bring Northern Ireland through the Troubles to a better tomorrow. Jill and I send our condolences to the entire Hume family. 
In the days that followed the El Paso shooting, I said Americans have to come together, stand against hate, and leave nobody behind.That charge feels more important than ever. This is our fight ‚Äî and together, we will win. 
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I‚Äôll spend my Monday mornings working with our nation‚Äôs top experts to control this virus ‚Äî not insulting them on Twitter. 
This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.It won't be easy ‚Äî but it's a battle we must win.
One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.He was wrong. 
Folks, there's simply too much at stake this November for anyone to sit on the sidelines. Register to vote today ‚Äî and then reach out to five friends and get them registered as well. 
Welcome home, Bob and Doug! The first American splashdown in 45 years was executed with precision, and is truly a victory for American innovation and persistence. Congratulations to everyone involved on a successful conclusion to this historic mission. 
Join us as we host a roundtable with Congresswoman Veronica Escobar to commemorate the anniversary of the El Paso Massacre: 
It‚Äôs not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises ‚Äî we need to build back better than ever. We have to create a new American economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
Now more than ever, we need a president who believes in science.
This pandemic has put a bright light on the disparities that have plagued our nation for too long. We‚Äôve got to make sure these communities get the help they need now ‚Äî and root out the systemic racism that created these inequalities in the first place. 
Enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight.We don‚Äôt have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus.Our health care workers still don‚Äôt have enough PPE.Enough with the weekend golf trips, Mr. President. Do your job.
Rent is due today.Donald Trump abdicated his responsibility to lead us out of this COVID-19 crisis‚Äîand we now face a potential housing crisis because of it.Mr. President: Act now to make sure Americans don't have to choose between a roof over their heads or food on the table. 
You have enough on your plate ‚Äî you shouldn't also have to worry about the president making things even tougher for you. 
If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of this nation.We can‚Äôt let that happen.
To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country run: I see you, and I promise I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America. 
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America ‚Äî and it's being written every day by folks like Dr. who fought the Ebola outbreak and now COVID-19. and I called to thank him for his service and discuss the moment we're in. 
Folks, we‚Äôre just a few hours away from our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline. We need everyone to step up so we can hit our goal and make sure we can go toe-to-toe with President Trump.If you're able, please chip in today: 
Jill and I are keeping everyone in the path of Hurricane Isaias in our prayers. We must ensure that our fellow Americans, in Puerto Rico and across the East Coast, get the support they need. Please heed the warnings from authorities, take steps to prepare, and stay safe. 
Together, we're going to make sure the future is made in America ‚Äî by all of America. 
Grassroots donations are the backbone of our campaign ‚Äî and we want to thank you for all your help. So tonight, Senator and I are hosting an event that you won‚Äôt want to miss.Chip in to reserve your spot:  
We‚Äôre facing some of the biggest challenges in our history ‚Äî and it‚Äôs abundantly clear Donald Trump just isn‚Äôt up for the job.We need real leadership ‚Äî and we need it now.
It‚Äôs been over six months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, and President Trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day.
 and I wish all our Muslim friends and neighbors a blessed  May your sacrifices on this day be accepted and strengthen you during these challenging times. Eid Mubarak!
Human trafficking is an unconscionable attack on the dignity of the most vulnerable among us. Action can‚Äôt wait ‚Äî on this World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, we‚Äôve got to join together and commit to ending trafficking.  
You won't have to worry about my tweets when I'm president.
Bill Barr is the Attorney General of the United States ‚Äî not the president's private attorney. 
55 years ago today, Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law. And ever since, they've extended lives, enhanced liberty, and put the pursuit of happiness within reach for millions.I'll protect and expand these programs for generations to come. 
Throughout his life, John Lewis taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.It's up to all of us to carry on his mission. 
It‚Äôs time Senate Republicans back their effusive praise of John Lewis with action. Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.
Even after his passing, John Lewis reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation.May his words guide us as we march on toward November. 
The last three months were the worst period for economic growth our nation has experienced in the 70 years since we started measuring it ‚Äî a drop of nearly 33 percent.Let's be clear: This is no act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership. 
I'm the proud husband of a teacher. I've seen firsthand how difficult the job can be in normal times ‚Äî let alone in the middle of a pandemic. So when I heard Beth's story, I knew and I had to give her a call. 
Donald Trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now.We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. 
We need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first. 
Folks, I'm excited to share that Senator and I are hosting a grassroots fundraiser this Friday ‚Äî and you're invited. We're going to chat about what's at stake this November and even answer a few of your questions.Chip in any amount to join us:  
Donald Trump has shown that he can‚Äôt beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. And he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain.He is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment. 
My heart goes out to Jessica and the countless others across the nation who have lost a loved one due to COVID-19. Behind every number we see in the news is a family and community that will never again be whole ‚Äî and we can't forget that. 
Congratulations to California Child Care Providers United on a successful election. As president, I'll make it easier for child care workers to unionize ‚Äî and I‚Äôll provide resources so they earn higher wages while also making care more affordable.  
We need an effective, coordinated nationwide testing and tracing program. We need more PPE for health care workers. We need a comprehensive plan to get this virus under control.We need this president to do his job.
I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is. But I‚Äôm optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.There is nothing we're unable to achieve when we do it together.
Listen to the scientists: Wear a mask. 
Donald Trump voted by mail. You should be able to as well.
Small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. But Black and Brown entrepreneurs face far too many barriers to ownership, growth, and success.I've got a plan to change that:  
America has never lived up to our founding promise ‚Äî and we can‚Äôt rest until we finally do. My new plan will advance racial equity across the American economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals:  
My housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse President Trump‚Äôs efforts to gut fair housing enforcement.We're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many Americans of color.
To support more Black and Brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new Small Business Opportunity Initiative. We're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.
In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.We have to break the cycle, and I‚Äôve got a plan to do it: 
This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It‚Äôs about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people‚Äôs struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.
A change of ‚Äútone‚Äù over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects.
The Senate and this President should pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act ‚Äî renamed yesterday in memory of John Lewis.If they don‚Äôt, it will be one of the first things I do as president.
I'm in Wilmington, Delaware, to unveil the fourth plank of my Build Back Better plan. Tune in as I discuss what my administration will do to advance racial equity in our economy: 
In this moment, we have the chance to build an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. One more vibrant and more powerful because everyone is in on the deal.Here's how we'll do it:  
We can't build this nation back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our country for far too long. That's why today, I'm releasing my new plan to advance racial economic equity across the American economy. 
Our students and educators deserve better than four more years of Betsy DeVos. It‚Äôs time for a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator. 
John ‚Äî march on, dear friend. May God bless you. And may you continue to inspire righteous good trouble down from the Heavens. 
Tonight, Jill and I are thinking about the 150,000 families left emptier by this virus.To anyone who‚Äôs struggling, sick, or wondering how they‚Äôll get through the day: know that I will not abandon you. We‚Äôll fight through this crisis together, and emerge stronger than ever.
Arianna‚Äôs a supporter of our campaign who‚Äôs been organizing food drives for her community during the COVID crisis. My team told me about her work, so and I decided to surprise her with a call. 
The development of a new vaccine requires a dedication to science, coordination, transparency, truth, and fairness to all ‚Äî and we have a President who stands for none of these things. 
These policies aren‚Äôt just the right thing to do ‚Äî they‚Äôre also the smart thing to do for the future of our country. 
Women-owned small businesses like Marsh + Mane are the backbone of communities across the nation. We have got to do more to invest in and support them.Here's what I'll do as president:  
 In 99 days, we have the chance to change the course of history by replacing Donald Trump with a compassionate leader who knows t‚Ä¶
The hard truth is women ‚Äî and particularly women of color ‚Äî have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. That's why today, I'm releasing my plan to make sure women can fully participate in our economy and country. 
The hard truth is this pandemic didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control: 
 We have just 100 DAYS until Election Day, and we need all hands on deck for this final stretch. So today, we‚Äôre kicking off 10‚Ä¶
In 100 days, we‚Äôre going to make Donald Trump a one-term president. 
Women have decided the course of history with grit, clarity, and courage. This election is no different.We have just 100 days to get out the vote, unite the country, and vote Donald Trump out of the White House.Join us, and let's get to work:  
Thirty years on, we still have work to do to realize the full aspiration of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We need to ensure that every American has the chance to live independently and free from discriminatory systems and practices.  
Folks, we have just 100 days until Election Day. Now, more than ever, we have to do everything we can to make Donald Trump a one-term president.Register to vote: Donate: Volunteer: Let‚Äôs get to work. 
In 100 days, we have the chance to set our nation on a new path. One where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone has a fair shot at success.Join us:

As Hurricane Hanna makes landfall, Jill and I are sending our prayers to the people of South Texas. We must ensure that affected residents get the support they need ‚Äî and get it quickly. If you are in an impacted region, please heed the advice of local officials and seek shelter.
I know firsthand how hard it can be to take care of an aging family member. It's why as president, I'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older Americans. 
No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. We have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and build an inclusive middle class that brings everyone along.
There is no quit in America ‚Äî and you deserve a president who won‚Äôt quit on you.
President Trump ordered his administration to slow down coronavirus testing, he tried to block CDC funding, and he has ignored the experts from day one. His actions defy both logic and humanity. What kind of president actively undercuts efforts that will save lives?
Every American family deserves access to affordable, high-quality child care.Here's how I'll make that happen:  
 üö® Sunday marks 100 days until Election Day üö®To kick off the final stretch, we‚Äôre hosting a  It will be‚Ä¶
I know times are tough, but I want you to know you're not alone. We're all in this fight together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before.
The President has a duty to care for us all. To see people where they are and to understand what they‚Äôre going through.I‚Äôve been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is. 
This is the United States of America. We don‚Äôt settle ‚Äî we aspire.Let‚Äôs get to work.
The hard truth is that we can't just build back to the way things were before these crises ‚Äî we have to build back better.President and I discussed how we can do that, and much more: 
Our nation is at a crossroads. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump‚Äôs divisive politics and failed leadership ‚Äî or we can forge a new path forward. 
Home care workers and child care workers ‚Äî who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants ‚Äî have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long.That will change with my administration: 
Donald Trump‚Äôs own staff admits that he fails the most important test of being the American President: the duty to care ‚Äî for you, for all of us. 
We need a president who listens to someone other than himself.
This was preventable. 
Out of every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger as a nation ‚Äî and we will again. If we come together, there is not a single thing we cannot accomplish. 
Hey here‚Äôs to hoping we both win big this fall. Stay safe.  
COVID-19 infections are going up.The number of deaths is going up. This morning it was announced that, once again, the number of unemployment claims is going up. Donald Trump is moving us backwards. The American people are paying the price.
Care jobs are ready to be filled right now, allowing millions of people ‚Äî primarily women ‚Äî to get back to work immediately.It's the right thing to do for our families and our essential workers ‚Äî and it's the smart thing to do for our economy. 
Folks, I sat down with my friend President to discuss the significant moment we're in, who we are as a nation, and how we can build back better.   Watch our full conversation: 
Every day I hear from folks who tell me how important health care is to their families ‚Äî well, it's deeply personal for President and me, too. I'll fight to protect and build on Obamacare and make sure everyone gets the care they need.Watch our conversation: 
Let me be clear: If vote-by-mail is good enough for Donald Trump and his administration, then it's good enough for all of us. 
I know everything feels different right now. There‚Äôs just that feeling where you don‚Äôt know if everything will be okay. But I promise you that it can be and it will be. 
Today, the House passed the  because no one should be discriminated against or singled out based on the faith they practice. I will end President Trump's Muslim Ban on day one and sign this bill into law.
My plan to create a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce will put 3 million Americans to work ‚Äî and free up millions more people to join the paid labor force.It's a fresh, bold approach that will help us recover faster and stronger. 
The goal of the Census is clear: count every person. But Donald Trump continues to use this vital process to sow division and scare immigrant communities.We won't let him deny communities the funding and representation they deserve. Because in America, everyone counts. 
The words of a president matter. And from the moment President Trump came down that escalator, he has used his to degrade people and sow division. It's not who we are.Watch my full conversation with President tomorrow at 10 AM ET. 
Today, we're facing a serious threat ‚Äî and we have to meet it together as one country. It's up to all of us to do everything we can to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy.

10 years ago the Obama-Biden Administration signed Wall Street reform to prevent the abuse that led to the Great Recession. Donald Trump and the Republicans have tried to tear it down ever since. As president, I'll protect it so we can rebuild an economy that works for everyone.
For your family, for your neighbors, for your country ‚Äî wear a mask.
Happy Birthday, Congressman Clyburn! Your powerful voice of moral clarity never fails to steer us toward a better future ‚Äî and reminds us all of why we're in public service in the first place. I‚Äôm grateful for your leadership and honored to call you a friend. 
Let me say what President Trump won't: Russian interference in our elections is a violation of our sovereignty. And if I‚Äôm president, I‚Äôll respond accordingly. 
Home health workers do God‚Äôs work, but aren‚Äôt paid much. They have few benefits, and 40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid. It's unacceptable.I'll give caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise.
We need to make high-quality child care affordable and accessible. As president, I'll give every 3- and 4-year-old access to free, high-quality preschool. And low- to middle-income families won‚Äôt spend more than 7% of their income on quality care for children under age 5.
We are trapped in a caregiving crisis, within an economic crisis, within a public health crisis. You‚Äôre doing everything you can, but this president is not.If I‚Äôm your president, here‚Äôs what I would do: 
Donald Trump simply doesn‚Äôt understand: We can‚Äôt deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis. And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest.
We have to mobilize a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation. Today, I'm delivering remarks about how we're going to get it done. Tune in: 
Today, I‚Äôm releasing my plan to mobilize a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce.It will ease the financial burden of care for families, create good-paying jobs with good benefits, and treat workers with the dignity they deserve. 
In honor of John Lewis, C.T. Vivian, and all the essential workers who have selflessly risked their lives, the Senate should pass a bill that ensures working people get real relief ‚Äî extended unemployment insurance, rental support, and guaranteed sick leave. 
Folks, it may be hard to believe, but we have just over 100 days until Election Day. I know we can beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better than before ‚Äî but we need your help to do it.If you're able, please chip in today: 
Small manufacturers like McGregor Industries demonstrate the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of America‚Äôs industrial base.Together we're going to make sure the future is made in America ‚Äî by all of America. 
Today, I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice: If elected president, I will direct my administration to impose substantial and lasting costs on those who interfere with American elections. 
We're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day. 
President Trump asked to see the COVID death chart. here you go. 
Every day it becomes clearer: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. Who we want to be. It‚Äôs all at stake.We have to vote Donald Trump out this November.
Imagine the future we can create with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where we:- Tackle the climate crisis- Build a new American economy- End our gun violence epidemic- Ensure our government works for all, not just the wealthy few
In this moment of crisis, we have the chance to build a new American economy. One where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.Together, we'll get it done.
Every day is National Ice Cream Day in my book. 
Mr. President, your ignorance isn‚Äôt a virtue or a sign of your strength ‚Äî it‚Äôs undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it‚Äôs costing Americans their jobs and their lives. 
The hard truth is that it didn‚Äôt have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the experts and refused to take action. He has failed our nation. 
 Throughout his public service career, has been there when so many of us have needed him. We want to know your 
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear.
Banning the Confederate flag from military installations was long overdue. Banning the LGBTQ Pride flag ‚Äî the very symbol of diversity and inclusion ‚Äî is undeniably wrong. The Pentagon should ensure it is authorized, or as President, I will.  
I know of no man with more courage than John Lewis. He was a giant walking among us. When I saw him, I couldn‚Äôt help but think one thing: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt done enough.‚Äù May his life and legacy inspire every one of us to strive for justice, equality and what is right. 
My full statement: 
We are made in the image of God, and then there is John Lewis. He was truly one-of-a-kind, a moral compass who always knew where to point us and which direction to march. To John‚Äôs family, friends, staff, and constituents, Jill and I send you our love and prayers.
As President, I will see to it that America once again stands for human rights. That doesn't mean rights only for some, but rights for all ‚Äî each and every American, and every person, everywhere. No exceptions. 
Today, we lost a giant of the civil rights movement and a relentless champion in the struggle for justice. Reverend C.T. Vivian never stopped pushing our nation closer to our highest ideals ‚Äî and we are better because of it. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers. 
Eleven. That's how many times we've broken the single-day record for new COVID-19 cases in the last month.This virus isn't going to "just disappear" like President Trump wants. It's surging ‚Äî and we need real leadership from this White House to slow its spread.
I‚Äôve released 21 years of my tax returns ‚Äî why hasn‚Äôt Donald Trump?We deserve to know what this president is hiding.
Everyone wants our schools to reopen. The question is how to make it safe and how to make it stick. Forcing educators and students back into classrooms in areas where infection rates are going up or remaining too high is just plain dangerous. 
We have to make the places we live, work, and learn healthier and more energy-efficient. That's why my administration will upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes across the country ‚Äî creating over one million jobs in the process. 
No matter who you supported in 2016, I want you to know that you have a home in our campaign. You‚Äôre not just wanted ‚Äî you‚Äôre needed.Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better than it was before. 
We have the power to write the future we want for our country. Don't let anyone tell you differently.
President Obama and I left a playbook for President Trump on how to fight pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're all paying the price every day.
From day one, Donald Trump has been focused on the stock market and delivering for his wealthy friends and big corporations.As president, I will be laser-focused on working families and small businesses. 
Let's call this what it is: A modern-day poll tax. It's unconscionable.We need to restore voting rights for individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies ‚Äî and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box. 
We are months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still being forced to reuse masks. It‚Äôs unacceptable.Mr. President, fix the PPE shortages before you tee off for yet another round of golf.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a public health crisis. 
I don‚Äôt have Bitcoin, and I‚Äôll never ask you to send me any.But if you want to chip in to help make Donald Trump a one-term President, you can do that here: 
Meeting the threat of climate change presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to jolt new life into our economy. We're going to create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future. 
There is no time to waste when it comes to addressing the existential threat of climate change. If I have the honor of being elected president, we'll get to work delivering results on day one. 
President Trump needs to do everything in his power to surge nationwide testing ‚Äî including developing and evaluating more accurate, affordable, accessible, faster tests so we can reopen safely.Infection rates are rising at an alarming pace. Mr. President, act now.
Mr. President, ‚ÄúOpen everything now,‚Äù isn‚Äôt a strategy for success. It‚Äôs barely a slogan. It‚Äôs long past time for you to step up and do your job.
This pandemic has gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public.I‚Äôm glad he made that shift ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not enough.We need real presidential leadership. Right now. 
We're facing an economic crisis and a climate crisis.  As president, I'll create millions of jobs building resilient roads and bridges, manufacturing electric vehicles, and weatherizing homes and buildings. Learn more:  
When I hear the words climate change, I hear the word "jobs." Good paying, union jobs that will solve our jobs crisis while addressing our climate crisis. 
Climate change is the challenge that's going to define our American future. And if I have the honor of being elected President, we won't tinker around the edges, we‚Äôll seize this opportunity and meet this moment in history.
 We want a president that‚Äôs going to prioritize infrastructure and clean energy.¬†Joe Biden will transform our roads and bridg‚Ä¶
When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, all he can muster is one word: ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù When I think about climate change, I think of a word as well: ‚Äújobs.‚Äù Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work. 
Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff ‚Äî or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration ‚Äî Donald Trump announces it‚Äôs ‚ÄúInfrastructure Week.‚ÄùHe's never delivered. I know how to get it done.
We can‚Äôt just build things back to the way they were ‚Äî we‚Äôve got to build America back better. Tune in as I deliver remarks on how we're going to invest in infrastructure and clean energy and create millions of jobs in the process: 
I want every single American to know: If you're sick, struggling, or worried about how you're going to get through the day, I will not abandon you.We're all in this together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before. 
We shouldn't have to beg this president to listen to the experts.
The hard truth is it didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump has squandered every chance he's had to contain the spread of this virus. 
America can‚Äôt sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. My administration will invest $300 billion in research and development over four years to secure our global leadership and create millions of good-paying jobs. 
"We're leading the world." 
Donald Trump needs to spend less time playing golf and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci.
In January, I sounded the alarm regarding COVID-19. Over five months later, President Trump still hasn't taken the action needed to respond to the virus. It's unacceptable.This president has failed the American people every step of the way. 
The stakes couldn't be higher this November. Time and time again, Donald Trump has failed the people of Puerto Rico.As President, I'll spur economic development on the island and expand access to health care.
Together, we're going to build a new American economy:  
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I'll actually listen to the experts and heed their advice. Not silence them. 
Mohamed Amashah is finally home after 486 days in Egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. Arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like Sarah Hegazy and Mohamed Soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. No more blank checks for Trump‚Äôs "favorite dictator." 
Ignore the polls.We‚Äôve got work to do:  
Health care is personal to me. And as president, I'll do everything I can to make sure every American has access to the care they need. 
We need a president who will always choose to unite rather than divide, because there‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt accomplish when we do it together.
To all the nurses on the frontlines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes. 
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.We need real leadership, right now. Lives are at stake. 
Back in January, when President Trump signed his hollow "phase one" trade deal with Beijing, I made clear that no one should be fooled by Trump's empty promises to deliver a meaningful ‚Äúphase two" deal.Good to see that he's finally admitting I was right. 
I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll say it again: Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. Every day that he remains in office, he further threatens the future of our democracy.We have to vote him out this November. 
I have no illusion about how tough the road ahead is. But I‚Äôm optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.Given a chance, ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things. 
This was almost two months ago. Since then? Tens of thousands more lives lost. A million and a half new cases.The President? Still golfing. 
The United States has over 3 million cases of COVID-19, and over 130,000 people have died ‚Äî yet Donald Trump continues to say it will just "fade away." It‚Äôs unbelievable.We're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day.
I see a different America than President Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity, and justice.I know we can reach our highest ideals ‚Äî together.
Still true. 
 Music unites us. üéßWe‚Äôre excited to be launching our new Spotify playlist, Get Up, Stand Up: Songs for the Soul of America, i‚Ä¶
Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you‚Äôve been knocked down. Respect for hard work, and for the people who do it. Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton ‚Äî and they're the values I‚Äôll take to the Oval Office.
This is what ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù looks like under President Trump: 
Through every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger ‚Äî and we will again.
Let‚Äôs use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is made in America ‚Äî and in all of America. 
Here's my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected president, I will take care of your family like I would my own. 
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
We can't just build back to the way things were before these crises ‚Äî we have to build back better.
This is our moment to imagine and build a new American economy ‚Äî one where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. 
I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now.
We can't just focus on the jobs of today ‚Äî we have to also focus on the jobs and industries of tomorrow. I'll make a historic $300 billion investment in research and development that will spur innovation and help create 3 million jobs across the nation. 
American workers can out-compete anyone, but they need a government that fights for them. I'll revitalize American manufacturing ‚Äî especially smaller manufacturers and those owned by women and people of color ‚Äî and ensure the future is made here in America. 
When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products ; support American jobs.But under Trump, the rate of federal contractors offshoring jobs more than doubled. It's unacceptable.I'll invest $400 billion in American-made products ; keep jobs here at home. 
I'm in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plan to create jobs, raise wages, and help America build back better. Tune in to watch: 
We're in the middle of an economic crisis. But it's not enough to just turn things around ‚Äî we have to build back better. We have to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made in America ‚Äî by all of America.Here's how we'll do it:  
The future must be made in America ‚Äî by all of America. Here's how we'll do it:  
As I was saying. 
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We need a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.
I commend the Task Forces for their service and for helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. And I am deeply grateful to for working with us to unite our party and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come. 
Increased testing isn‚Äôt the reason for the surge in coronavirus cases ‚Äî Donald Trump's failed leadership is. 
Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.He's spread racism against our Latino community ever since.We need to work in partnership with Mexico.We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.That's what I'll do as President.
Let me be clear: No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can‚Äôt pay rent. 
When there were 15 cases, the President said it wouldn't spread any farther. We just hit our 3 millionth case.We're paying for his failure. 
 ‚Äî The courage you show every day is an inspiration to so many, and I'm grateful to have you by my side in this fight. We may not agree on everything, but this we do: Health care is a right ‚Äî not a privilege. And we're going to make that a reality, together. 
This is a national disgrace. We have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately ‚Äî and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on. 
The most sacred obligation of our government is to keep our troops safe when we send them into battle ‚Äî and to care for them when they come home. We need a president who will honor that obligation. 
Across the world, people come to this country with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. They study here, innovate here, they make America who we are. Donald Trump doesn't get that ‚Äî we need a president who does. 
Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as President, I will rejoin the and restore our leadership on the world stage. 
We've seen what happens when the federal government fails to secure sufficient supplies of critical products like PPE ‚Äî and we can't let it happen again. So today, I'm releasing my plan to rebuild U.S. supply chains: 
Donald Trump needs to do his job.
Character belongs in the White House. 
To beat COVID-19, we need a coordinated national response from the federal government ‚Äî but Donald Trump refuses to do his job. I've laid out exactly what I would do, and I encourage this president to adopt the plan in its entirety: 
There‚Äôs enormous opportunity once we defeat Donald Trump. We are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than they've ever been before.
The nation is crying out for leadership ‚Äî leadership that can unite us and bring us together. But this president has nothing to offer. 
With COVID-19 surging across the nation, Donald Trump should be doing everything in his power to increase access to testing. Instead, he's doing the opposite. It's despicable.
It didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump failed to do his job ‚Äî and we're all paying the price. 
We can‚Äôt afford four more years of Donald Trump. 
We're going to beat Donald Trump. And when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation ‚Äî we'll transform it.
There are so many unsung heroes in our communities, especially in times of crisis. We owe Alassane and countless others a debt of gratitude ‚Äî and I'll fight for them every day in the White House. 
On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. It‚Äôs time for free and fair elections so that the Venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime.
COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped.
Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he‚Äôs wrong ‚Äî on both fronts.We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises.
The hard truth is that it didn‚Äôt have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the warnings and refused to take action. He failed our nation. 
I‚Äôve carried the middle class values that my parents instilled in me my entire life ‚Äî and they‚Äôre the values I‚Äôll bring to the White House. 
Make no mistake, our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there‚Äôs not a single thing we cannot do.
The health care workers on the frontlines of this fight are some of the greatest heroes our nation has ever seen. 
America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all ‚Äî and it's long past time we lived up to it.
American history isn‚Äôt a fairytale. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. But it‚Äôs a battle we can and will win ‚Äî together.
This Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask.
Our nation was founded on a simple idea: We're all created equal. We've never lived up to it ‚Äî but we've never stopped trying. This Independence Day, let's not just celebrate those words, let's commit to finally fulfill them. Happy  
‚ÄúIf you put the wrong person in office, you'll see things that you would not have believed are possible." 
It didn't have to be this bad. But month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us.Here's what I'll do as president: 
It‚Äôs abundantly clear that this virus isn‚Äôt going to just ‚Äúfade away,‚Äù Mr. President. It‚Äôs time for you to step up, take action, and lead. 
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose science over fiction.
Donald Trump styled himself as a wartime president. But now it seems this president has surrendered. He has waved the white flag and left the field of battle when we need him most. It's unacceptable.We need real leadership. Right now. 
We are five months into this crisis, and our health care workers still don't have the masks and protective equipment they need. It's a national disgrace.Mr. President, use your authority and fix the shortage of PPE before you tee off for yet another round of golf.
Donald Trump has called himself a "cheerleader" for the nation. But we don't need a cheerleader ‚Äî we need a President. One who will:- Lead by example- Take responsibility- Tell the unvarnished truth- Listen to the experts and follow the science
Wear a mask. 
Let me be clear: There‚Äôs no victory to be celebrated when we‚Äôre still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better. 
This is a job Donald Trump is entirely unfit for. 
‚ÄúMr. President, it's too much.‚Äù 
This is a shameful move. Now is the time for employers to have empathy for families juggling work and caregiving.It's long past time for President Trump to show some leadership so we can get this virus under control. 
Tune in as I address the nation on the economic crisis and the latest jobs report: 
Mr. President, this pandemic isn't about you. It's about the health and well-being of the American people. 
125 days. 
I‚Äôll read my daily briefings.
Small businesses are the backbone of communities across our nation, and we need to do so much more to help them. Donald Trump may have forgotten about them ‚Äî but I never will. 
If the reports are true, Donald Trump either read his briefings about the Russian bounties and did nothing ‚Äî or he didn't read them at all. Either way, it's an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.The American people deserve answers. 
On day one, I‚Äôll get right to work tackling COVID-19. I'll bring together our nation's top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.We are all in this together ‚Äî and we've got to fight this together. 
We need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period.It‚Äôs not just about you ‚Äî it‚Äôs about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It‚Äôs about keeping other people safe.
This is my promise to you: When I am President, I will take care of your health care coverage and your family the same way I would my own. 
As  comes to a close, I want to make one thing clear: Immigrants have always made our nation stronger ‚Äî our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength.Donald Trump doesn't get that ‚Äî we need a president who does.
Folks, we‚Äôre just a few hours away from our end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal. Every donation ‚Äî big or small ‚Äî goes a long way to helping us catch up to Donald Trump.If you can, please chip in today: 
On the final day of  here‚Äôs my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected, I will be the most pro-equality president in our nation‚Äôs history. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights ‚Äî and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
We‚Äôre facing a serious threat ‚Äî and we need to meet it together as one country. But this President gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another.We can't continue on like this. 
If I‚Äôm elected, I‚Äôll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. I‚Äôll have the nation‚Äôs top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one ‚Äî and I'll actually listen to them.
Mr. President, the American people didn‚Äôt make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.Step up. Take responsibility. Do your job.
Tune in as I deliver remarks on how President Trump failed to protect the American people, save our economy, and control the virus: 
I want every single American to know: if you‚Äôre sick, if you‚Äôre struggling, if you‚Äôre worried about how you‚Äôre going to get through the day ‚Äî I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.We are going to get through this ‚Äî together.
As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself.
Folks, tomorrow night marks our first end-of-quarter deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal so we can catch up to Donald Trump's hefty cash-on-hand advantage. I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today: 
The President spent his weekend golfing. 
Here‚Äôs my promise to you: I‚Äôll appoint a director who will actually go after financial predators and protect consumers. 
Today's decision reaffirmed that states can't put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions‚Äîbut the fight isn't over. As President, I'll codify Roe v. Wade and protect a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to choose. 
It's time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity and respect, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.We are everything that Donald Trump is not.
William Perry Pendley spent his career fighting to sell off public lands ‚Äî and to allow drilling, mining, and logging on them with hardly any oversight. Now the President has nominated him to oversee them at Consider me opposed. 
White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history ‚Äî not promoted by the President of the United States.
The arc of the moral universe bent a little bit more today. 
Obamacare was and is a big deal. We can't let Donald Trump tear it down ‚Äî we have to protect and build on it. 
51 years ago today, a movement was born on Christopher Street. As we remember the anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising and the brave individuals who changed our world forever, let's recommit to finishing the job and finally achieving full LGBTQ+ equality.  
Donald Trump's entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale. It‚Äôs a betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation, to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm‚Äôs way. 
Today the President shared a video of people shouting ‚Äúwhite power‚Äù and said they were ‚Äúgreat.‚Äù Just like he did after Charlottesville. We‚Äôre in a battle for the soul of the nation ‚Äî and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: it‚Äôs a battle we will win.
Children should be released from ICE detention with their parents immediately. This is pretty simple, and I can't believe I have to say it: Families belong together. 
Now, let's push our progress further. 
Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
Wear a mask. 
If Donald Trump prevails in the U.S. Supreme Court, insurers could strip away your health insurance coverage or jack up premiums ‚Äî simply because you experience long-term effects after battling the coronavirus.We can't let that happen. 
Equal representation and participation matter.  
I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.
Health care is a right for all ‚Äî not a privilege for the few. We have to ensure every single American has access to the care they need and deserve.Here‚Äôs what I would do as president:  
Congratulations, Alexis. We need you in this fight. Proud to stand with you and Planned Parenthood Action Fund. 
Progress is possible. 
Donald Trump is acting like a child who just can‚Äôt believe this pandemic has happened to him. 
Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would "fade away."Now, we're facing a record-high number of new cases, and it's surging across the country.Trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action ‚Äî and we're all paying the price.
In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to root out systemic racism and close the racial wealth and income gaps. We can do it, together. 
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a global pandemic.
DC should be a state. Pass it on. 
The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus ‚Äî we've lost lives, businesses, paychecks. And now, we're losing the progress we've made because this president refuses to do his job.Donald Trump has failed our nation every step of the way. 
While President Trump continues his victory lap, over 20 million Americans remain out of work. He may have forgotten about you, but I never will ‚Äî and I'll fight for you every single day in the White House. 
While the Trump Administration continues their efforts to rip health care away from millions, I'm speaking about how we can make quality, affordable health care available to every American.  Tune in: 
Health care workers are selflessly risking their lives every day on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 ‚Äî and hundreds have paid the ultimate price.They are American heroes ‚Äî and we cannot forget the sacrifices they made to care for us all. 
Democracy is under threat globally. Restoring the soul of America means fixing democracy at home, and confronting ‚Äî not cozying up to ‚Äî dictators around the world. When I'm president, America will defend democracy at home and abroad. 
Health care is a right for all ‚Äî not a privilege for the few.
This virus is not just going to disappear because you want it to, Mr. President.Listen to the experts. Take clear, concrete action. Do your job. 
Tonight, and I will be hosting "A Community of Pride" to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the world's first Pride march. Join us, and at 7:30 PM ET:  
I am proud to have the under the exceptional leadership of my friend Gina McCarthy, by my side. Together, we'll lead the world in a clean energy revolution that will help us reduce our carbon emissions and create good-paying union jobs.

Brian ‚Äî the courage and strength you've shown in the face of daunting odds is an inspiration to us all. I'm confident that with folks like you leading the way and with the power of our best minds, we'll find treatments and cures and beat this thing once and for all. 
Workers called back on the job deserve access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing.
Instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking Americans get through this crisis, Republicans are jamming through another one of Trump‚Äôs unqualified nominees. It's wrong.Cory Wilson lacks judicial temperament and experience‚Äîand has no place on a Federal Court. 
We need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care ‚Äî not rip it away.
To everyone who is scared, hurting, and wondering what's going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I hear you. And I'll fight for you every single day in the White House. 
Our planet cannot take four more years of Donald Trump. 
The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There‚Äôs not a single thing we can't do if we do it together.
It's clear Donald Trump will stop at nothing to tear down Obamacare and rip health care away from millions. We cannot let him get away with it. We have to build on the ACA with a new public option to ensure everyone receives the care they deserve. 
It's pretty simple: If we want to save people's jobs and save people's lives, we need more testing ‚Äî and we need it faster. The President is intentionally slowing it down. 
This is yet another attempt to distract from this Administration's failure to lead an effective response to COVID-19. Immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. The President can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis. 
It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
To Ashley, and all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes. 
Tomorrow, President and I are hosting a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We‚Äôll be answering some of your questions and taking a few trips down memory lane. You won‚Äôt want to miss it. Time is running out to reserve your spot. RSVP today: 
The strength of the LGBTQ+ community has always been rooted in the ability to find hope in spite of setbacks. If we stand together  we'll get through this ‚Äî and emerge stronger. 
No one should have to choose between their paycheck and their health. That's why my plan for a safe and effective reopening ensures everyone has access to testing and paid leave for all those who get sick from COVID-19.Read more here: 
We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.We can't stand by and let that happen.
From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President ‚Äî I've spent my career fighting against injustice. And I'm not finished yet. 
Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolas Maduro. As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy. 
Trump opposed sanctioning China‚Äôs government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.Where Trump has been weak, I will be strong, clear, and consistent in standing up for America's values and its people. 
My dad instilled a lot in me, but perhaps most important is the belief that there‚Äôs no higher calling than to be a good parent. Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all the dads working to help raise their children ‚Äî and all our children ‚Äî to be honorable, generous, and kind. 
I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing ‚Äî not slowing it down. 
It‚Äôs in some of our darkest moments of despair that we‚Äôve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before. 
Speed up the testing.
I've found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose. Christian Cooper and I discussed how we can take our collective pain in this moment and turn it into a catalyst for change: 
This nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but Trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. As president, I'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America.  
Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 ‚Äî but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains: 
Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he‚Äôs willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines ‚Äî as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.Unbelievable.
The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history ‚Äî and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.It‚Äôs time we reckon with what happened in 1921. 
Christian Cooper‚Äôs encounter in Central Park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. I'm grateful for Christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done. 
We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:- Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs- Stands in the way of the CDC- Refuses to wear a maskHe is failing even the most basic test of leadership.
I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for ‚Äî and we are all called to the cause.None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.
Donald Trump‚Äôs failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives ‚Äî and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
I‚Äôve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important ‚Äî who we want to be. It‚Äôs all at stake.That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election: 
On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, TX, the last enslaved African Americans were finally given notice of their freedom. 155 years later, we're still on the long road to equality, equity, and fairness for all.We can't rest until the promise of this nation is fulfilled.  
 reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity‚Äîbut it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all.
Amy ‚Äî from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we‚Äôre going to beat Donald Trump. 
Climate change is linked to increased pregnancy risks ‚Äî and heartbreakingly, Black mothers are being hit the hardest. As President, I'll work every day to tackle the climate crisis head-on and root out injustice. Because they are intertwined. 
To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you.  
The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court ‚Äî and the generational impact its justices can have.We have the power to shape the Court's future this November ‚Äî and we can‚Äôt forget that.
I'm ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready? 
Dreamers are Americans. Period.
Just like Donald Trump couldn‚Äôt wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn‚Äôt tweet it away in April ‚Äî he can‚Äôt ignore it away in June. 
Here‚Äôs my promise to you: On day one, I‚Äôll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It‚Äôs long overdue.
It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.We need a president who will put the American people first ‚Äî and actually do the work. 
Thanks, Barack. You're right ‚Äî and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country. 
Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it. 
The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. And as President, I will get to work immediately to make it permanent. 
Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy ‚Äî but he has surrendered the fight.Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.
Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are ‚Äúdown to‚Äù fewer than 750 a day.That's more than 20,000 a month ‚Äî and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President. 
I‚Äôm proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today‚Äôs  Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the  now and take action to root out systemic racism. 
If John Bolton's accounts are true, it‚Äôs not only morally repugnant, it‚Äôs a violation of Donald Trump‚Äôs sacred duty to the American people to protect America‚Äôs interests and defend our values.
Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it ‚Äî and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.This president has failed to lead our nation. 
Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world ‚Äî killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind. 
I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in: 
The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.It has to change.
We need a president who chooses unity over division.
I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. 
We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all ‚Äî not just the powerful.Let‚Äôs do it together.
We can‚Äôt forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.
Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement ‚Äî and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward: 
This virus won‚Äôt just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It‚Äôs time for you to step up and do your job.
Los Dreamers son estadounidenses. Trump les quit√≥ la protecci√≥n que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. Esto es inaceptable. El primer d√≠a de mi presidencia enviar√© un proyecto de ley al Congreso que proteger√° a los beneficiarios de DACA de la deportaci√≥n. 
LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. Period.
Folks, I‚Äôve got some big news: Next week, I‚Äôm getting together with my friend and former boss, President for a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We would love to see you there. Chip in now to get your ticket: 
Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It‚Äôs unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress. 
I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn‚Äôt, and it won‚Äôt. American history isn‚Äôt a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. It's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the American ideal finally wins out. 
I'm grateful for support and proud to stand with them in this fight. As president, I‚Äôm going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care ‚Äî including reproductive health care. 
Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response. 
Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.Here‚Äôs what I would do as president: 
Today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect. But we're not done. 
After reports of wealthy Trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the PPP money went. It's unacceptable.The American people deserve answers. 
In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.Together, we‚Äôre going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all.
We need a president who heals ‚Äî not one who fans the flames of hate. We need a president who unites ‚Äî not one who sows further discord for political gain. We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand ‚Äî not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.
We‚Äôre facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation‚Äôs history ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear Donald Trump isn‚Äôt up for the job.We need real leadership, right now.
We have to ensure every worker called back on the job has access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing and effective personal protective equipment. 
We need a president who will fight to further LGBTQ+ equality ‚Äî not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.
We need real policing reform ‚Äî and we need it now. 
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can't go back to the way things were before ‚Äî we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.We can do it, together.
Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation ‚Äî not use them for political gain.We shouldn‚Äôt accept anything less from an American president. 
We need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.
I‚Äôve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can‚Äôt let that happen.
In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period. 
On the fourth anniversary of Pulse.In the middle of Pride month.During a global pandemic.Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November. 
Two years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. Photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy. 
Medgar Evers once said, "freedom has never been free." On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today.
Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub. As we remember those we lost ‚Äî including so many in the LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities ‚Äî we have to double down on our efforts to  
We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:- Outlaw chokeholds- Improve oversight and accountability- Create a model use of force standard- Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces
Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn‚Äôt forget about us. The President couldn‚Äôt wish away the virus in April, he couldn‚Äôt tweet it away in May, and he can‚Äôt ignore it away in June.
Our country is crying out for leadership that Donald Trump can‚Äôt deliver. 
We need a president who chooses hope over fear.
We can't let history repeat itself ‚Äî Facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. Watch my deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it:  
COVID-19 can affect anyone, anywhere ‚Äî but it doesn't impact every community equally. Watch as Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton explains how it‚Äôs impacting communities of color: 
While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week. He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country ‚Äî and hardworking Americans are paying the price. 
We have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong ‚Äî and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen: 
We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen: 
We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen: 
With less than 150 days until Election Day, the stakes couldn't be higher. We've got to fix Facebook to protect our democracy and ensure fair elections. If you agree, sign the open letter today to demand Facebook take action.  
So far, Facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. Time is running out. Today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies: 
Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk. We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.
It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress ‚Äî and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.
There is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do ‚Äî and we have to do the hard work to end it. 
We have to make this an era of action ‚Äî starting with real police reform. No more excuses. No more delays. Add your name to demand Congress ban chokeholds ‚Äî and pass real police reform ‚Äî right now: 
This pandemic isn't just going to go away because you want it to, Mr. President. Step up and do your job before your negligence costs even more lives than it already has. 
Ignore the polls. We can't take anything for granted this November ‚Äî the stakes are simply too high. Register to vote:  Donate:  Volunteer:  Let's get to work. 
Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years.  But I‚Äôm ready to get to work on day one. We can‚Äôt accept anything less from an American president.
Donald Trump‚Äôs hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country‚Äîbut just fixing the way the president talks won‚Äôt cut it. We need to root out systemic racism and ensure Black Americans have a real shot to get ahead. 
America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We‚Äôve never fully lived up to that promise ‚Äî and we can‚Äôt rest until we finally do.
From ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines ‚Äî what happened today in Georgia should enrage us all. We need to act now to prevent it from happening again in November. Our democracy depends on it. 
Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence: - More than 110,000 people have died- We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19- Over 20 million Americans are out of work And yet he‚Äôs patting himself on the back. Unbelievable.
Small businesses like Rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. We have to do so much more to help them through this crisis. 
 Problems or questions related to voting in Georgia's primary election today? Just give us a call at 888-730-5816. 
Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing. We need justice. We need action. We need reform.
Grief is a heavy burden to bear ‚Äî and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose ‚Äî to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service: 
My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.I'm a Catholic ‚Äì just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either.
13 million people who had jobs when you took office are unemployed today. 
Together, let‚Äôs make this an era of action. 
This moment is a wake-up call for all of us. It's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many. 
Donald Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the Obama-Biden Administration, but like everything else he‚Äôs inherited, he has squandered it. 
To everyone speaking out and peacefully demanding justice across the nation: I see you, I hear you, and I stand with you. 
At every turn, President Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people ‚Äî and we‚Äôre all paying the price every single day. 
We've made incredible progress on LGBTQ+ equality, but we still have further to go. We can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law‚Äîregardless of who they are or whom they love.Join  and let's get to work:  
We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what‚Äôs really going on in this country. It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions.
American history isn‚Äôt a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.Don't let anyone tell you differently.
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics ‚Äî or we can take the next great step forward. 
These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It‚Äôs time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations ‚Äî and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps. 
We need to build an economy that rewards work ‚Äî not just wealth. 
This isn‚Äôt about politics. This is about the future of our country. Grateful for your support, Secretary Powell. 
The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart. We cannot give him another four years in the White House.
We need to stand up as a nation ‚Äî with the Black community and with all minority communities ‚Äî and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone. It is the duty of every American to grapple with it ‚Äî and grapple with it now.
I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn‚Äôt just become another hashtag ‚Äî and I intend to keep that promise. We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.
To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what‚Äôs going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won‚Äôt ever forget you. And I won‚Äôt be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you. 
Today, we honor those who answered duty‚Äôs call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice‚Äîand recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. 
Today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause. No one can stay silent. 
We're just 150 days out from Election Day, and the stakes have never been higher. We have to defeat Donald Trump, and once we do, we won‚Äôt just rebuild this country ‚Äî we'll transform it. Together. Help us make it happen: 
Donald Trump was warned, but he failed to act. Now more than 20 million Americans are out of a job and paying the price. It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. 
150 days.
Folks, tonight we secured the 1,991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. I'm going to spend every day fighting to earn your vote so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation. 
Tonight, I‚Äôm thinking of Breonna Taylor‚Äôs mother, Tamika Palmer. Today should have been her daughter's birthday. I've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. But for Breonna and Tamika, it‚Äôs on us to find purpose. Our country needs to act ‚Äî now. 
Donald Trump still doesn‚Äôt get it. He‚Äôs out there spiking the football ‚Äî completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives. 
This  I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the  movement.The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop.
When it comes to this economic crisis, Donald Trump either doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, or he just doesn‚Äôt care. 
Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it: 
Let‚Äôs be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God ‚Äî but to the failure of a President.
George Floyd‚Äôs last words, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe,‚Äù have echoed across our nation and around the world.For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable. 
Tune in as I speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy: 
Those who have worked the closest with Donald Trump know how unfit he is to serve as President. 
It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.
We can‚Äôt take four more years of this.
To everyone struggling with mental health‚Äîyou're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help. Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. 
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I‚Äôll do my job and take responsibility. I won‚Äôt blame others. And I‚Äôll never forget that the job isn‚Äôt about me ‚Äî it‚Äôs about you.
We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists.
 We have to speak up  ‚Äî be a voice for the voiceless and fight for what our communities need.We have to carry on. 
Jim Mattis and I haven‚Äôt always agreed on everything, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more powerful indictment of Trump's actions and character than the one he's written. "We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose." 
I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn‚Äôt, and it won‚Äôt. American history isn‚Äôt a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.It's up to all of us to create the America we know we can be. 
More than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest. 
There‚Äôs no time to waste ‚Äî we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump‚Äôs desk in the next few days. Period. 
The nation is crying out for leadership ‚Äî but this president has nothing to offer.
Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? 
We need a president who listens. 
It‚Äôs in some of our darkest moments of despair that we‚Äôve made some of our greatest progress ‚Äî and we have that chance once again. We‚Äôre not just going to rebuild this nation ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to transform it. There is nothing we can‚Äôt do if we do it together. 
If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation ‚Äî closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be.
I ask all of America ‚Äî not to deny our pain or cover it over ‚Äî but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.
If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump‚Äôs unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution‚Äôs promise of equal protection under the law.No more excuses. No more delays.
When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.Donald Trump was elected to serve us all ‚Äî but he only looks out for himself.
The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won‚Äôt either.But I promise you this: I won‚Äôt traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country ‚Äî not use them for political gain. 
That‚Äôs what the presidency is: a duty of care ‚Äî to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us. 
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù George Floyd‚Äôs last words. But they didn‚Äôt die with him. They‚Äôre still being heard. They‚Äôre echoing across this nation. It‚Äôs a wake-up call for all of us. 
Juli√°n ‚Äî I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on ‚Äî and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support. 
I‚Äôve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important‚Äîwho we want to be. It‚Äôs all at stake. That is truer today than ever. And it‚Äôs in this urgency we can find the path forward.
The President held up a bible at St. John‚Äôs church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. That‚Äôs hard work. But it‚Äôs the work of America.
A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time.
Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in: 
Pride is a global movement of love, self-expression, and community ‚Äî resilient in the face of oppression and fear and hopeful for a better future. This month, let us recommit to those principles and remain steadfast in the fight for justice and equality. 
He's using the American military against the American people.He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.For a photo.For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together. 
In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake. We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.
Leaders listen. 
After another night of unrest in America, I‚Äôm hosting a virtual roundtable with mayors from across the country to discuss where we go from here. Tune in: 
We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. As President, I will help lead this conversation ‚Äî and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington. 
We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. 
Trump‚Äôs Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19. 
If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out.
You can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. And when leaders give it oxygen ‚Äî as Donald Trump has done ‚Äî it comes roaring back.We all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable. 
Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel. 
Every day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president. 
This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.This is a national crisis ‚Äî and we need real leadership right now.
We are a country with an open wound.None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words ‚Äî ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äù ‚Äî and do nothing.We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. 
It‚Äôs time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.It‚Äôs time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.We need justice for George Floyd.
Tune in as I address the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the killing of George Floyd: 
I will be speaking more about the events in Minnesota later today.
I will not lift the President‚Äôs tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I‚Äôm furious, and you should be too.
This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.
Enough.
We can‚Äôt allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation. 
We‚Äôre months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy. I do: 
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America ‚Äî and we‚Äôre seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope. 
100,000+ lives lost across the country.1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.Donald Trump has failed our nation.
Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump‚Äôs utter failure of leadership. 
Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I‚Äôm releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities: 
The hard truth is that this crisis didn‚Äôt have to be this bad.
Two tweets from the same day in October. 
Every day Donald Trump proves how unfit he is to lead our nation. 
Presidents are supposed to lead by example ‚Äî and every day Donald Trump proves how incapable he is of doing that. 
George Floyd‚Äôs life mattered. 
 and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. His outspokenness raised our consciousness on HIV/AIDS and saved countless lives. 
There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you. 
Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.Read more from and me: 
We‚Äôre in the middle of a global pandemic ‚Äî and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he‚Äôs also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.It‚Äôs morally reprehensible.
Tune in now as joins me for a conversation on how COVID-19 is impacting states: 
This morning, I‚Äôll be joined by for a conversation on how COVID-19 is making an impact on states. Tune in live at 10:30AM EDT:  
Last year California passed  affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November.
George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved ‚Äî they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation. 
Wear a mask.
Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.We need a government that works for all ‚Äî not just the super-wealthy.
The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president‚Äîespecially in times as tough as these. But we‚Äôre coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.If you can, please chip in today: 
1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It‚Äôs a crisis unlike anything we‚Äôve seen in our lifetime ‚Äî and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.
Folks, today we‚Äôre launching  ‚Äî a next generation coalition ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president. We've got unlimited capacity to create change ‚Äî and together, we‚Äôre going to transform this country.Join today:  
So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look: 
There‚Äôs not a single thing the American people can‚Äôt do if we do it together.
We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities ‚Äî and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come.
This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone ‚Äî including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies ‚Äî has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box. 
To all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget.  
The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn‚Äôt prepared for that. I promise you I will be.
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future ‚Äî and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.
Hunger today isn‚Äôt about scarcity ‚Äî it‚Äôs about a massive failure in leadership. If I were President, I‚Äôd immediately work with to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis. 
We‚Äôre in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is trying to prevent people from getting health care. 
Folks write letters to me asking all kinds of questions, but Jack's question on my favorite ice cream flavor might be the best one yet.Here‚Äôs what I told him:  
Make no mistake: I believe our best days still lie ahead. We can and will transform this nation ‚Äî together.
Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work.Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing. 
As Ramadan draws to an end, and I want to wish a safe and warm celebration to our Muslim friends and neighbors. Even though we can't be all together to celebrate, we hope it is filled with joy, family, and success for the year to come. 
This is jarring ‚Äî and a heartbreaking reminder that the death toll we see in the news is so much more than just a statistic. Every single one marks a future cut short and a family and community that will never be the same. and I are keeping them all in our hearts. 
Donald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. It‚Äôs unacceptable.I‚Äôll make meaningful investments in Indian Country ‚Äî including increasing funding for Indian Health Services and making that funding mandatory. 
 While these two fight over their big mistakes let‚Äôs make sure Alabama doesn‚Äôt make one with either Sessions or a former foot‚Ä¶
We can protect the sacred right to vote and protect public health at the same time.
The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.It‚Äôs one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
36,000 Americans could be alive today if President Trump had acted sooner. Let's put that into perspective: 
We're in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetime, and Senate Republicans continue to delay relief for the American people saying, "I don‚Äôt see the need right now." Unbelievable.We've got to take back the Senate this November. 
Adi is an incredible young advocate for the transgender community. He also graduated high school today. We wanted to say congrats...with a couple friends! 
Chip in to help make it happen:  
No worker‚Äôs life is worth getting a cheaper hamburger. Period. 
Think of how many small businesses could have been helped with the $47 million that went to private jet companies owned by wealthy Trump donors. It‚Äôs ridiculous.We need a president who puts hardworking Americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected. 
We will get through this, and we will come out stronger. I promise. 
In announcing the intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, President Trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership. 
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: No company pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.It's time for Amazon to pay its fair share. 
Join Andrew Yang to discuss the economic impact of COVID-19. Tune in now: 
In the middle of this crisis, President Trump is trying to cut food assistance. It‚Äôs morally bankrupt.We should do everything in our power to ensure no one goes hungry in America.

A president who can't handle a crisis is no president at all. 
It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump failed to take action, and it cost American lives. 
Turns out, it takes more than a tweet to implement a comprehensive national testing strategy. 
I‚Äôm looking forward to joining my friend on the tonight. Check out some of my favorite moments from the last time I was on his show ‚Äî and then make sure to tune in to CBS at 11:35 PM ET. 
I don't usually Google myself, but I made an exception for Autocomplete Interview. Check it out: 
Donald Trump‚Äôs inaction cost lives. 
While we hope to soon return to some sense of normalcy in our lives, we cannot allow ourselves to return to the everyday gun violence that has plagued our past. We need to pass common-sense reforms and end our gun violence epidemic. 
I promise you this: A Biden Administration will listen to scientists and heed their advice ‚Äî not silence them. 
When I launched my campaign, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation ‚Äî we‚Äôre seeing that soul on full display. Folks are reaching out to help one another and doing truly heroic things. It makes me so proud.
This shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. We need to ensure every single eligible American can safely make their voice heard this November. 
We don't have a food shortage problem ‚Äî we have a leadership problem. 
Donald Trump is using a global health crisis as an excuse to deport children and continue separating families. It's heartless and un-American. People across the political spectrum rejected these policies before, and will do so again, because they know families belong together. 
Folks, I‚Äôm excited to share that we‚Äôre hosting a grassroots fundraiser with Grassroots donors are the backbone of our campaign ‚Äî and I want to thank you for all your support.Chip in any amount to join us Friday afternoon: 
My heart and Jill's go out to the people of Midland, Michigan, experiencing another crisis in the midst of this pandemic. 
Donald Trump needs to do his job and implement a national testing strategy.
From my home in Delaware to Milwaukee, Wisconsin ‚Äî join us for a virtual rally at 3:30 PM CT:  
Donald Trump has failed to provide for our nurses and doctors on the frontlines. Now he‚Äôs short-changing our troops and their families. Unacceptable. 
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide.
When we emerge from this crisis, we can‚Äôt just go back to the way things were before. We need to take this country to a place we‚Äôve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream.
Congratulations to Dr. on the start of her second term. Taiwan‚Äôs thriving democracy and response to COVID-19 are an example to the world. America‚Äôs support for Taiwan must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan. 
The United States of America has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation ‚Äî and we will again. We will overcome this.
Fundamentally, this is about whose side the government is on and whether it is accountable to the American people. This is a case I will continue to make, and if elected president will deliver on. 
That's exactly why and I have called for more oversight. We need more conditions on corporations to ensure relief goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No $500 billion slush fund. No blank checks. The Trump Administration is prioritizing big corporations over workers.
During today‚Äôs Senate Banking Committee hearing, Secretary refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in CARES Act funds to keep workers on their payrolls. asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused.
Today, and I are mourning the death of our dear friend, Annie Glenn. Her long life was filled with great love and great meaning, with purpose and her own brand of uncommon courage. 
Tonight, I'll be joining for a virtual town hall to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on food security and the restaurant industry ‚Äî and what our government should be doing to ensure no one in America goes hungry.Watch live at 7 PM ET: 
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis. 
We need a president who believes in science.
I am proud to stand with in calling for a strong OSHA standard for RNs and other frontline health care workers and full utilization of the Defense Production Act to mass produce personal protective equipment. 
It‚Äôs time we reward the people who actually make this country work. Not Wall Street CEOs ‚Äî but the middle class. Ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.That's who I'll fight for every single day in the White House.
Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus. But he does bear full responsibility for failing to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.
With your help, we'll defeat Donald Trump. And we won't just rebuild this nation ‚Äî we‚Äôll transform it. I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today to help make it happen: 
One of President Trump's top advisors admitted that this administration "really let the country down" on testing.He's right. It's long past time for Trump to step up and implement a national testing strategy so we can begin safely reopening the economy. 
- Expand vote-by-mail and early voting- Implement online voter registration- Ensure everyone can safely vote in-personWe need to do everything in our power to ensure every American can safely make their voice heard this November.
Companies getting relief from taxpayers have an obligation to protect workers' paychecks, and the Trump Administration has an obligation to hold their feet to the fire to ensure they do.We need real relief paired with real oversight‚Äînot no-strings-attached corporate bailouts. 
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history ‚Äî and his recovery efforts are making that clearer than ever.
In the middle of the worst public health crisis in our lifetime, President Trump is actively trying to terminate health insurance for millions of Americans. It's unthinkable.Here's what I would do to ensure everyone has access to the coverage they need: 
In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. It's who we are. And it's how we're going to get through this ‚Äî together.
A year ago today, the House passed the  a long-overdue bill that would ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated with dignity and respect under the law. But won't bring it up for a vote. It's unacceptable.Passing it will be a top legislative priority of mine.
I'm incredibly grateful for everyone who has chipped in to help fuel this campaign ‚Äî especially in times as tough as these. and I called a few folks to thank them for their support: 
As we reflect on the incredible legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, we‚Äôre reminded of the urgent work that remains before us 66 years later. We can‚Äôt rest until every kid gets a fair shot, and we finally live up to our founding ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all.
Moments of crisis require presidents to step up, transcend partisan politics, and unite the nation to achieve a common goal. But Donald Trump has done nothing but stoke division‚Äîand we're seeing the effect every day. He is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis. 
No graduating class gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but few have ever entered at a point in this country's history where they genuinely have a chance to write a new chapter.Congratulations to the class of 2020, I can't wait to see the future you create. 
Behind every COVID-19 death is a family and a community that will never be the same.Behind every unemployment claim is a life thrown into uncertainty ‚Äî a person wondering how they‚Äôll make ends meet.There is a real human toll to this crisis. We cannot forget that.
Today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, I stand with LGBTQ+ people and their allies to celebrate and champion the inherent dignity and worth of all persons‚Äîregardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.  
Congratulations to the Class of 2020 and to all those who were a part of the journey. I can't wait to see what you all accomplish.  
From this moment of crisis, we have the opportunity to not just rebuild our economy ‚Äî but transform it.
Every day Donald Trump proves how wholly unfit he is to lead our country. 
We need a president who puts hardworking Americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected. 
Defeating Donald Trump is going to take everything we've got. His campaign has been preparing for the last four years and has millions in the bank. I know times are tough, but if you can, please pitch in today to help us catch up:  
On this Armed Forces Day, and I want to express our gratitude and support for the men and women in uniform ‚Äî serving and defending our country around the world. Thank you for your selfless service and sacrifice. You continue to make us proud. 
It seems the way to get fired by President Trump is not to commit wrongdoing, but to investigate it. 
Science over fiction.
The fact is Donald Trump wasted an awful lot of time, and lives were lost as a consequence. 
I want Donald Trump to look the American people in the eye and explain why their hard-earned dollars are bailing out his wealthy donors. 
We're building a campaign that will defeat Donald Trump and transform this nation ‚Äî but we need your help to do it. Join us this Sunday for a Grassroots Strategy Summit, where we'll lay out our path to victory and how you can get involved:  
Unions like are supporting their workers and communities during this pandemic. To build a stronger, more inclusive, and more resilient middle class after this crisis, we must encourage unionization. That starts with enacting the PRO Act. 
Los fracasos internacionales de Trump han abierto el camino para que Cuba se una al Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Esto traiciona a los presos pol√≠ticos en Cuba y mina a√∫n m√°s la diplomacia de los EE.UU. Como presidente, defender√© los derechos humanos del pueblo cubano.
Trump's international failures have cleared a path for Cuba to join the UN Human Rights Council. This would betray Cuba's political prisoners and further undermine U.S. diplomacy. As President, I will lead by empowering the Cuban people and defending human rights.
To everyone who has lost a loved one due to COVID-19: I know it's incredibly difficult right now, but there will come a time when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. It will take time, but that‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôre going to make it. 
If you‚Äôre looking for ways to show off your support for the campaign or to stay entertained while we‚Äôre social distancing, we‚Äôve got you covered. Check out our new free store where you‚Äôll find everything from phone backgrounds to crossword puzzles: 
We have the power to create the future we want. A future where:- We end our gun violence epidemic- We lead the world in combating climate change- Everyone has access to the health care they need- Our government works for all ‚Äî not just the wealthy and well-connected
To all of our front line workers who are working day in and day out to keep our nation afloat during this crisis, thank you.
We are months into this crisis. There is simply no excuse for President Trump's failure to implement a national testing strategy.
Tonight, and I will be joining for a discussion on combating COVID-19 and how we can ensure everyone can make their voice heard this November.Tune in to at 10 PM ET to watch live. 
What he said. 
Donald Trump can deflect and shift blame all he wants, but the hard truth is he failed to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime. 
Sherian, a small business owner from South Carolina, recently asked how I would help businesses like hers recover from this crisis and how we can tackle health care disparities among communities of color. They're important questions. Here's what I said: 
The lives of tens of millions of Americans have been thrown into chaos through no fault of their own ‚Äî and Donald Trump simply isn't doing enough to help them. 
Join me for a virtual roundtable on COVID-19 with Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont who are at the forefront of this crisis: 
Small businesses are the backbone of this country. We have to do so much more to support them through this crisis. Here's what I would do if I were president: 
With the void of leadership in the White House, governors across the country have stepped up to meet this moment. This afternoon, I‚Äôll be joined by a few of them for a roundtable discussion on COVID-19. Tune in at 3:30 PM ET to watch:  
As the economy continues to spiral downwards and unemployment soars to Great Depression-era levels, we cannot ignore the hard truth: This crisis hit us harder and will take longer to recover from because of Donald Trump‚Äôs failures. 
There's nothing that the American people cannot accomplish when we stand together ‚Äî one nation, united in purpose.
Happy Birthday to the one and only 
‚Äú60 days into the coronavirus crisis, the White House does not have a plan, a framework, a philosophy, or a goal.‚ÄùReal presidents lead. Reality TV presidents don‚Äôt. 
Not only does the Trump Administration want to take away health coverage for millions in the middle of a pandemic, but now they want to let people go hungry, too. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds. 
Moments of crisis require swift and decisive action from our leaders, but Donald Trump and his administration have done nothing but dither and delay. They have failed the American people on every single front. 
I would trust the guy who‚Äôs one of our nation's top public health experts, not the one who pondered injecting disinfectant into the body and looked directly at a solar eclipse. 
Enough with the anger and division and fear-mongering, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up, appeal to our better angels, and unite the country. We'll overcome this crisis by coming together ‚Äî not by tearing each other apart. 
It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. Donald Trump utterly failed to prepare for this pandemic and delayed in taking the necessary steps to safeguard our nation against the near-worst-case-economic scenario we are now living. 
We owe so much to every single worker on the front lines of this crisis. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. Here's what I would do if I were president: 
I joined on Good Luck America to discuss everything from memes to stimulus oversight. Head to  to watch the interview today, Thursday, and Friday.
A united party is key to winning the White House this November. The work of the task forces will be essential to identifying ways to build on our progress and not simply turn the clock back to a time before Donald Trump ‚Äî but transform our country. 
Donald Trump can put up all of the banners he wants in the Rose Garden, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he failed our nation when it comes to COVID-19 testing. 
I wish the president would spend less time talking and tweeting and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci. This isn‚Äôt politics. This is life and death. 
 and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Aimee Stephens. We send our deepest condolences to her wife, Donna, and her family. Aimee's spirit and courage will not only be her legacy but our guiding light as we carry on her fight for equality. 
The Trump Administration clearly knows what's needed to make workplaces safe and operational: adequate testing, contact tracing, masks, and additional precautions.They're putting in the work to keep themselves safe. Why aren't they doing the same for the American people? 
This is a bunch of malarkey and you know it, We left a 69-page playbook on how to fight pandemics.You can read it here if you‚Äôd like: And make sure to pass along your notes to President Trump. He could use them. 
Donald Trump knew about this crisis all the way back in January ‚Äî and his response since has been incompetent at best. 
That‚Äôs the plan. 
Here's the deal: We can choose who our country works for. We can choose whether it works for just the wealthy ‚Äî or everyone else as well.That‚Äôs the choice we must make ‚Äî all of us together ‚Äî this November.
Let me be clear: My Administration will review every single stimulus loan given to big companies and political insiders. We will find any dollar taken corruptly, we will come get it, and we will punish the wrongdoers. 
I believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success ‚Äî not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.
Donald Trump just doesn't understand: We have an economic crisis because we have a public health crisis ‚Äî and we have a public health crisis because he failed to act. 
In April, we raised $60.5 million between my campaign and I'm humbled and know what a sacrifice it is to give in times as difficult as these. But May is our most important month yet, and we need your help. If you can, please chip in today: 
Donald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it‚Äôs unnecessary for the American people?
With folks staying at home during this time of social distancing, we put together some fun activities to keep everyone entertained. Text FREE to 30330 to be the first to get a look at what we‚Äôve been working on. 
Donald Trump hopes to split us into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.It‚Äôs a childish tactic‚Äîand a false choice none of us should fall for. 
I have a better idea: give people coronavirus economic relief and don't hold their hard-earned benefits hostage. 
This crisis presents an opportunity to not just rebuild our economy ‚Äî but transform it. joined me to discuss how we can do that and create a stronger, fairer, more inclusive middle class.Listen to the full episode:  
No podemos callar ante la violencia contra personas transg√©nero de color, como las recientes tragedias en Missouri y Puerto Rico. Es nuestra obligaci√≥n garantizar que todos puedan vivir abiertamente, con orgullo y sin miedo. 
We cannot be silent in the face of rising violence against transgender people of color‚Äîlike the recent tragedies in Missouri and Puerto Rico. It's our moral obligation to end this epidemic, and ensure everyone can live open and proud and free from fear. 
 and I covered a lot of ground on the next episode of Here's the Deal, but the most surprising part might have been learning about his connection to the Roosevelts.Make sure to tune in for the full episode tomorrow morning:  
Don't let anyone tell you differently: We have the power to write the future we want for our country.
Tax cuts for the super-wealthy.Bailouts for large corporations.Working Americans left behind.That‚Äôs Donald Trump‚Äôs record. 
I believe rebuilding the middle class is the moral obligation of our time. We have to build a stronger, more inclusive, more resilient middle class ‚Äî one that can withstand the next public health crisis or whatever else comes our way. 
Ordinary people, given half a chance, have never let their country down.That‚Äôs who I believe in. That‚Äôs who I‚Äôm in this race to fight for.
To the extraordinary mothers everywhere, like Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, my wishes for a safe and happy Mother‚Äôs¬†Day. 
There's a clear choice this November:Donald Trump will do everything he can to terminate health care for millions in a global pandemic.I will do everything I can to ensure every American has access to the quality, affordable care they need. 
There‚Äôs no quit in America. None at all. We‚Äôre going to get through this ‚Äî and we're going to come out stronger.
This is inexcusable. 
No one should pay a dollar out of pocket for coronavirus testing or treatment. Period. 
Imagine what we could be doing now with the $2 trillion in tax cuts that Donald Trump delivered for his rich friends. 
We need to rebuild the backbone of this country ‚Äî the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along.We have to make sure every single person gets a fair shot at success.
Crisis reveals character ‚Äî and character belongs in the White House. 
Ahmaud Arbery was shot down in cold blood. His family deserves justice ‚Äî and they deserve it now. 
Make no mistake: COVID-19 has caused a massive economic challenge. But this crisis hit us harder, and will last longer, because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength. 
Two years ago, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran Deal. This week, he vetoed a war powers resolution that would've prevented him from starting a war with Iran without Congressional consent. His decisions have increased the risk of war in the Middle East. 
Corruption is a feature of Donald Trump's economic agenda‚Äînot a bug. He will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.I say it‚Äôs time we pick a different way‚Äîone where everyone gets a fair shot at success, not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. 
75 years ago on  America and its allies defeated fascism in Europe. From the devastation of war, we built a lasting peace. Today, as we honor the veterans who sacrificed for us, let us remember the importance of uniting against common threats.
It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump was simply not up to the job.

Every step of the way, President Trump has ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people ‚Äî and we‚Äôre all paying the price every single day.I promise you, I will do the opposite.

The nurses on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe, emergency paid sick leave, and premium pay. 
You heard it straight from the president himself: He wants to terminate health care for millions of Americans in the middle of a global pandemic.We can't let that happen. 
The stakes in this election have never been higher. Over the last few months, we've seen how wholly unfit Donald Trump is to lead our nation.We have to vote him out of the White House this November.
We can‚Äôt sit by as Donald Trump and Republicans use COVID-19 as an excuse to disenfranchise voters. We need to ensure people have the opportunity to vote by mail, early vote, vote absentee and, in every way possible, safely vote in person this November.

Today, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump-backed lawsuit to dismantle the ACA enters a new phase. If Trump and Republican AGs succeed, it‚Äôll mean devastation for our health care system that will cause untold pain and suffering. We can't let that happen. 
These stories are heartbreaking and remind us that the numbers we see in the news are more than just statistics. Every death is a tragedy and marks a family and community that will never be the same. and I are keeping them all in our prayers. 
The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood. My heart goes out to his family, who deserve justice and deserve it now. It is time for a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder. 
This didn't have to happen. The Trump Administration failed to take action and produce desperately needed protective equipment ‚Äî and those on the front lines of this crisis paid the price. It's heartbreaking. 
The Biden Administration will not silence scientists. 
The choice between the economy and public health is a false one‚Äîif we don‚Äôt beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. We have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy. 
It‚Äôs important to stay connected while we‚Äôre social distancing ‚Äî but there‚Äôs always that one friend who doesn‚Äôt get the hint when it‚Äôs time to end the video chat. Glad we don‚Äôt know anyone like that ‚Äî right,

I've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one America. This crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. There's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.
In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. 
The hard truth is that it didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately ‚Äî all of it stems from Donald Trump‚Äôs failures as president.

This  support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable ‚Äî especially not in the White House. 
Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.
A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it‚Äôs why Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.
The U.S. Postal Service is an essential pillar of American life. We simply cannot let Donald Trump destroy it. 
Over the last few weeks, I worked with our supporters and staff to create a code for our campaign‚Äîthe principles we‚Äôll live by, reflecting the community we‚Äôve built, the team we aspire to be, and some of my own ‚Äòrules‚Äô as well.I‚Äôm excited to share it:  
This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together ‚Äî across the nation and around the world ‚Äî to solve this crisis.
When I say Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history, this is what I'm talking about.Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it. 
We left a playbook. He ignored it.We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it.We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out.Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared. 
Mi coraz√≥n y el de Jill est√°n con Puerto Rico a ra√≠z de los terremotos de hoy. Mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del COVID-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo m√°s pronto posible.
My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible.
To don‚Äôt give up this fight. This is not over yet.To equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding. 
On March 6th, Donald Trump said: ‚ÄúAnybody that wants a test can get a test.‚ÄùIt was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide.
When we come together and act as one America, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish.
No one should have to pay for coronavirus treatment. Period. 
I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America. The president should encourage folks to follow Gov. Whitmer‚Äôs public health orders ‚Äî not sow further discord and division. 
As we mark the beginning of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, and I extend our best wishes to AANHPI communities across America. We look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead.
When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We have to build a better future for all.We can and will transform this nation ‚Äî together.
This crisis isn't about you, Mr. President. It's about the American people. 
We have lived long enough with a President who doesn‚Äôt think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That‚Äôs not me. As a Presidential candidate, I‚Äôm accountable to the American people. 
We need a president who listens. 
We need more tests. Our front line workers need protective equipment. Americans need additional economic relief.Yet the Trump Administration is spending time and energy on President Trump's wasteful border wall.Unbelievable. 
The number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.We have to do more to help them. Now. 
- More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died- 30 million have filed for unemployment- At least 1 million have gotten sickEnough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead.
Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April.He was wrong. And we're all paying the price. 
An open and independent press is more important than ever in times like this. They deserve to be treated with respect ‚Äî not belittled with schoolyard taunts from this president. 
Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty. 
I‚Äôve been a big fan of Megan‚Äôs for years and can‚Äôt wait to join her this afternoon. You can watch our chat live at 2:45 PM ET:  
We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together. 
As president, I promise you I'll honor all those we've lost from COVID-19. 
The climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action to combat it before it's too late. 
In the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is still working to gut the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.They need to drop the lawsuit immediately. 
With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions.
The words of a president matter ‚Äî and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19, pass blame onto others, and mislead the American people. I will do the opposite. 
The Trump Admin failed to provide enough testing, PPE, and safety enforcement. Workers have gotten sick, plants have closed, and the meat supply is at risk. It's past time workers have the protections they need to stay healthy and do their job safely. 
"I wish he were president right now, but I can't wait until he is if all of us do our part to support the kind of person that we want back in the White House." ‚Äî us:  
Wear a mask in public.Read your daily briefings.Listen to the experts.This really isn't rocket science. It's common sense.
Throughout our history, we have emerged from every crisis stronger than before ‚Äî and we will again.
We owe a profound debt of gratitude to the health care workers on the front lines of this fight. I checked in with Monica, an ICU Nurse, to talk about how she's getting through this and to thank her for all she's doing: 
I couldn't agree with more. We need a president who will listen to the science, bring us together, and lead with compassion and heart. If I have the honor of being elected, that's the exact kind of president I will be. 
There are nearly 330 million people in the United States ‚Äî and according to the Trump White House, we've only conducted 5.4 million COVID-19 tests. It's abysmal.Donald Trump needs to scale up testing, and he needs to do it immediately.
Let me be very clear: No one is expendable.We shouldn‚Äôt allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability.
The fact is there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. If we had listened to the experts and heeded their warnings, it could have been stopped short. But Donald Trump failed to act ‚Äî and now the American people are paying the price. 
I‚Äôve known for years, and know that her dedication and passion for bettering our country are second to none. I‚Äôm grateful for her endorsement and for her friendship ‚Äî and look forward to working alongside her to get Donald Trump out of the White House.

We're months into this crisis and workers still don't have enough protective equipment, there still aren't enough tests, and the death toll continues to rise.The President should spend less time congratulating himself and more time doing his job. 
We are months into this crisis, and health care workers still don‚Äôt have the protective equipment they need. It‚Äôs a national disgrace.

We want our country to get moving and healthy again. But we must take the necessary, rational steps, grounded in science, to do so safely, so COVID-19 doesn‚Äôt come roaring back. 
I'm incredibly honored by endorsement and grateful for her historic leadership in Congress. Together, we helped pass Obamacare and together we can not only bring this country back from the brink from this current crisis, but transform it. 
America has always met every big challenge with an even bigger solution ‚Äî this moment should be no different. We need an infrastructure program that will combat climate change and create good-paying jobs at the same time.
Wealthy firms with ties to Trump got millions, while countless small businesses were turned away. No wonder he wanted no one to watch how the money was deployed.The American people deserve rigorous oversight ‚Äî and small businesses deserve relief. Now. 
The American people are stepping up and rising to meet this moment. It's time for our president to do the same.
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction. 
Imagine the future we can build with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where:- Health care is a right- We combat climate change- We end our gun violence epidemic- Our government works for all ‚Äî not just the powerfulLet‚Äôs build that future, together.
The workers on the front lines of this crisis are risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. 
366 days ago, we launched this campaign.192 days from now, we‚Äôll beat Donald Trump.Let‚Äôs go win this thing, together.

It‚Äôs stories like these that make me so proud to be an American and make me confident that we will overcome this. Because there‚Äôs nothing the American people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
After seeing the shortage of masks around the country, Marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in Northern Virginia to make homemade masks. Because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe.
Older adults are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Recognizing that, Erica decided to organize youth in her community to buy groceries for seniors ‚Äî ensuring they receive the food they need while staying safe at home. She's a true hero.
Brien usually works at the Ford Plant in Rawsonville, Michigan, driving a semi. But when the plant started assembling much-needed ventilators, he courageously stepped up and volunteered to help. His selfless actions will no doubt save countless lives.
John, a Facilities Maintainer from Staten Island, recently contracted and survived the coronavirus. Shortly after he recovered, a colleague contracted the virus and needed plasma to battle it. John heroically stepped up and donated his plasma to help his coworker.
Across the country, people are stepping up and doing incredible things amid this pandemic. It‚Äôs who we are as Americans‚Äîin times of crisis, we stand as one. For  I called a few folks to thank them for all they‚Äôre doing. Here are some of their stories:

When I announced my campaign one year ago today, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation.One year later, that is as true as it has ever been. I believe we can and we will emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. Together, as one America. 
Donald Trump needs to step up and do everything he can to give our front line workers the protective equipment they need. 
I know times are tough, but we have to campaign as hard as ever to take the strongest fight possible to Donald Trump. He has a lot more money than us, and we need your help to close the gap.If you can, please chip in today:

I know this is a dark time for so many people, just know that we will get through this. We will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever before. 
UV light? Injecting disinfectant?Here‚Äôs an idea, Mr. President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals. 
The words of a president matter ‚Äî never more than in times of crisis. A president should seek to calm and heal, provide a steady hand, and a clear path forward.Instead, this is what we get from Donald Trump: 
Donald Trump will always put his wealthy and well-connected friends first ‚Äî that should come as no surprise. But to allow the banks to do it on the backs of small business owners in the middle of a global pandemic is a new low ‚Äî even for him. 
To celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting our first  this weekend. Folks across the nation will be taking time to check-in on neighbors and thank those on the front lines of this fight.I hope you'll join us:

Unlike our current president, I will always choose science over fiction. 
Make no mistake: The climate crisis poses an existential threat to our future. But I know the American people have the spirit, power, and ingenuity to meet the challenge head-on. There‚Äôs nothing we‚Äôve been unable to accomplish when we do it together.

Folks, we just launched a special  episode of Here's the Deal! Governor joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, climate change, and why he's supporting our campaign.Listen to the full episode now:  
The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It‚Äôs unacceptable.We can‚Äôt safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can‚Äôt effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job.
The Paycheck Protection Program was intended to send help to the small businesses that needed it most, but President Trump adopted an approach to help his high-priced friends. We've got to do better.Here's what I would do if I were president: 
The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We need to immediately expand vote-by-mail, online voter registration, and early voting to ensure everyone can safely exercise their right to participate in our electoral process. 
I know COVID-19 is causing many people to feel anxious about what the future holds or lonely during this time of social distancing ‚Äî and that's okay, just know that you're not alone. I've asked my friend, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to share a few tips on how to get through this: 
This Holocaust Remembrance Day, as we remember the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime, we recommit to ensuring such atrocities never again occur. With anti-Semitism on the rise, all of us must root out intolerance and give hate no safe harbor.
Out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger ‚Äî and we will again. We will not be defeated.
I am honored to have the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, a leading environmental advocacy organization. Climate change is an existential threat, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity facing our country and our world. 
In March alone, this campaign raised $46.7 million, with 70% from online donations. This virus has changed our campaign. But it hasn't changed the unwavering support we've gotten from all of you. Together, we're going to defeat Trump. Help keep us going: 
The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job.

At a time when studies are linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality rates for the most vulnerable in our society, the Trump Administration is rolling back environmental protections ‚Äî allowing more poison into our air. 
As Kierkegaard said, ‚Äúfaith sees best in the dark.‚Äù I've always believed that. This pandemic is keeping many communities apart, but we've still got to keep the faith. Jill and I are wishing a Happy Easter to all of the Orthodox Christians celebrating around the world. 
The United States should be standing up for freedom and standing with the people of Hong Kong. Instead, Trump has said he's ‚Äústanding with Xi Jinping.‚Äù That's weak. We need to be strong on values when it comes to China. That's what I'll do as president. 
I couldn't be prouder of my friends and Chris Martin of for organizing the One World:  broadcast. We are all in this fight together ‚Äî and if we stand as one, we will defeat COVID-19. 
On Sunday night, and actor will be hosting an unemployment town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting entertainment workers. Tune in tomorrow at 7 PM ET to watch live:  
We will not be defeated. 
Donald Trump left our country unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime ‚Äî and now we're paying the price. 
Donald Trump says he‚Äôs a wartime president ‚Äî it‚Äôs time for him to act like one.
Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy. 
Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It‚Äôs always somebody else's fault ‚Äî never his. It‚Äôs unbelievable.We deserve better from our commander in chief. 
Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.Experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved.Trump failed to take swift action‚Äîand we're paying the price. 
President Trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to China and COVID-19 ‚Äî but the facts don't back him up. Tony Blinken was the Deputy Secretary of State and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. He'll explain. 
The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in China's leaders instead. Now, we're all paying the price.Let me explain how we got here: 
I know the American people will beat this. We‚Äôre brave and big-hearted. We‚Äôve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation ‚Äî and we will again.
We‚Äôre in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover. We need to provide paid sick leave to everyone who needs it immediately.
It's been a big week: President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Senator Warren all endorsed our campaign ‚Äî and we need your help to keep this momentum going.I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today: 
Together, we will defeat Donald Trump. 
Today‚Äôs news that more than 22 million people filed unemployment claims over the last month is devastating. It‚Äôs clear more needs to be done to help hardworking Americans‚Äîso I‚Äôm calling for a bigger, bolder approach to keeping people on the job. Read more: 
These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are.COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together‚Äînot by targeting people of AAPI heritage. 
Here's the simple truth: This nation has never been defeated when we're together ‚Äî and we're not going to be defeated now. We will overcome this. 
When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all.
To combat COVID-19, we need a decisive public health response to curb its spread and a comprehensive economic response that delivers real relief to Americans.I've released several plans outlining exactly what I would do if I were president. Take a look: 
When somebody is President of the United States, the responsibility is total. 
So this week, we‚Äôre working through what ours will be. There are a few I know: compassion, kindness, humility, gratitude, and joy. But I want your help. Our supporters have been here from the start‚Äîand I want to know: what should be in our campaign‚Äôs code? 
We won‚Äôt defeat this President by being like him. We‚Äôll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we‚Äôll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we‚Äôll show compassion. And when he fights, we‚Äôll fight harder. But we can‚Äôt do it without you.
Mayor campaign had a set of ‚Äúrules of the road‚Äù that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it‚Äôs a good idea, and one I‚Äôd like to adopt.
In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, ‚ÄúJoey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.‚Äù I‚Äôm working on building one for our campaign, too.
Managing an economic relief and recovery effort is hard, painstaking work. The devil is in the details. It‚Äôs all about follow-through.I've done the work before, and I'll be ready to do it on day one as president. 
We are building the movement that will beat Donald Trump.Join us:  
Millions of folks are relying on the workers at the front lines of this crisis. I‚Äôll be talking to a few of them for our virtual town hall. Tune in: 
This afternoon, I‚Äôll be hosting a virtual town hall with a few workers on the front lines of this crisis. Tune in at 3:00 PM ET to watch live:  
COVID-19 is amplifying so many inequities in our society. We have to ensure support gets to those who need it immediately, and then do the necessary work to rip out the structural racism that creates these inequalities. 
The President‚Äôs vanity is preventing people from paying their bills. 
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I‚Äôm proud to have the fiercest of fighters, Senator on my side. With her help, we‚Äôre going to beat Donald Trump and create a government that works for everyone ‚Äî not just the wealthy and well-connected. Let‚Äôs do this. 
From my basement to your sneaker room. Tune in Thursday at 11 PM ET on to watch! 
I want Donald Trump to look these folks in the eye and explain to them why they or their loved ones haven‚Äôt been able to get tested for COVID-19. We‚Äôve got to do better. 
Let‚Äôs do this. 
Millions of people are relying on the workers on the front lines of this crisis. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll be joined by a few of them for a virtual town hall. Tune in tomorrow at 3PM ET:  
You have great taste, 
Stories like this showcase exactly who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We help out folks we've never met, lift each other up, and do our part to ensure we make it through.We will overcome this, together. 
President Obama understands, as I do, that we will come through this crisis stronger. And then we‚Äôll not only rebuild this nation ‚Äî we will transform it. 
Barack ‚Äî This endorsement means the world to Jill and me. We‚Äôre going to build on the progress we made together, and there‚Äôs no one I‚Äôd rather have standing by my side. 
Leadership is about never proclaiming power. It‚Äôs about collaboration, it‚Äôs about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. It‚Äôs about results.  That‚Äôs who I am and the role I aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times.
I am not running for office to be King of America. I respect the Constitution. I‚Äôve read the Constitution. I‚Äôve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country‚Äôs governors ‚Äî Democratic and Republican ‚Äî are doing under these horrific circumstances. 
I want to congratulate on her hard-earned victory tonight. In the face of rampant voter suppression and GOP recklessness, the people of Wisconsin showed up and made their choice clear. I know Wisconsin will be a fairer, more just state with Jill on the court. 
I am grateful to have the support of so many Wisconsinites and proud of the courage and commitment folks showed during last week's primary ‚Äî but it should never have come to that.No one should ever have to choose between their health and our democracy. 
It shouldn't take a global pandemic shutting down schools to end school shootings. 
For months, the Trump Administration was repeatedly warned about the threat COVID-19 posed to our nation. They ignored the experts, failed to take action, and now Americans are paying the price. 
We‚Äôre in the middle of a global pandemic. We need a president who actually listens to public health experts. 
To Bernie‚Äôs supporters: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome on this campaign. You‚Äôre needed. 
Unity. 
I'm speaking now about our nation's economic response to COVID -- and I'll have a special guest with me. Tune in: 
Folks, I hope you'll join my 2:00 PM Economic Response to COVID-19 remarks ‚Äî I'll be joined by a special guest. Tune in at 2:00 PM to watch live! 
Our U.S. Postal Service workers are at the front lines of this crisis. Millions of people are relying on them for things like medicine and other essentials.And the President is trying to let them fail. Congress should do everything it can to prevent this. 
Tune in at 2:00 PM today for remarks on the urgent and dire need for a full economic response to COVID-19 at  
For this episode of Here‚Äôs the Deal, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham joined me to discuss presidential leadership and what it should look like in times of crisis.You can listen to the full episode at  or wherever you get your podcasts. 
We're facing a crisis unlike any we've faced before ‚Äî and I couldn't be prouder of how the American people are responding. 
To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.
As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration‚Äôs failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes. 
Folks, we just released a special Sunday episode of Here‚Äôs the Deal! joined me for a discussion on faith and its intersection with some of the most pressing issues we face as a nation.Listen at  or wherever you get your podcasts. 
This Easter, Jill and I wish all of you and your families a safe and joyful celebration, and we join our prayers with those of people from every faith for health, happiness, and a renewal of life in the year to come. 
 While our family may be physically distancing, our traditions keep us connected. Ready for Easter! 
We are in the middle of a global pandemic ‚Äî and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.
This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together.
We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible. Workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately. There's no time to waste. 
We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable.Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act immediately. 
Now more than ever, we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.
President Trump needs to do everything in his power to expand the number of testing sites and surge the number of tests. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and finding a way out of this crisis. 
The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. There's nothing we can't do if we do it together.
No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately. 
We need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic‚Ää ‚Äî ‚Ääincluding the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders‚Ää ‚Äî‚Ää with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president. 
The folks on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes. 
La historia de los EE.UU. es la historia de gente com√∫n que hace cosas extraordinarias. S√© que unidos, y como una naci√≥n, nosotros somos m√°s fuertes que este virus. S√© que superaremos esto y seremos m√°s fuertes por ello, se lo prometo. No pierdan la fe. 
The health inequities being exposed by COVID-19 are unconscionable.We can do better. We have to. 
Whether you supported Bernie or any other candidate throughout the primary, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. You're not just welcome ‚Äî you're needed. And I will do everything I can to earn your vote this November.
America‚Äôs story is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things given half a chance. This virus is tough. But together and as a nation ‚Äî we're tougher.I know we‚Äôll get through this and we‚Äôll be stronger for it, I promise you. Keep the faith. 
The stakes in this election have never been higher. We have to come together and beat Donald Trump.
This virus can hit anyone ‚Äî regardless of race, economic status, or access to power ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources.We have to do better for all our people. 
The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. We need to take extraordinary steps to protect American families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole. 
This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims‚Äîon top of the millions already filed‚Äîis devastating. We have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there.I'm announcing two new policies to help Americans get the relief they need: 
I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests ‚Äî not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis. 
We have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. So today, I'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. As president, I will:- Lower Medicare eligibility to age 60- Forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families 
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.
Eleven-year-old Isaac Johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. My advice was simple:- Stay a safe distance from friends- Sneeze into your elbow- And eat your vegetables 
A total of about 17 million people have filed for unemployment over the last three weeks. This is unprecedented. The economic devastation that families all across this country are experiencing is not their fault. We've got to take extraordinary steps to protect them. 
We're seeing the soul of our nation on full display every day in this crisis ‚Äî and it makes me so proud to be an American. 
If we come together, we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation ‚Äî we will transform it.
This nation has never been defeated when we‚Äôre together. And we‚Äôre not going to be defeated now.
Join our virtual town hall on unemployment and the issues currently facing working families across the nation. Tune in now: 
The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but the slow and chaotic response to it is. He's the commander in chief ‚Äî it's time he steps up, takes responsibility, and does his job. 
The primary is over, but we're just getting started. We're building a campaign to defeat Donald Trump and ensure that America finally lives up to our founding promises ‚Äî but we can't do it without your help.If you're with us, chip in today: 
In the wake of COVID-19, working families across the country are facing a whole new set of challenges. This afternoon, I'll be hosting a town hall to listen to folks' concerns and discuss what we should be doing to deliver relief.Tune in at 5:30 PM ET:  
Together we will defeat Donald Trump. But we will also address the climate crisis. We will make college affordable. And we will make health care available to all.  We will not just rebuild this nation ‚Äì we‚Äôll transform it. And I‚Äôm asking you to join me. 
And to Bernie‚Äôs supporters: I know that I need to earn your votes. And I know that might take time. But I want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of this moment. I hope you'll join us. You're more than welcome: You're needed.
We know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation ‚Äì and the need to defeat Donald Trump ‚Äì above all else. And for that we‚Äôre grateful. But we want you to know: we‚Äôll be reaching out. You‚Äôll be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.
To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven‚Äôt just run a political campaign; you‚Äôve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it‚Äôs a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That‚Äôs a good thing for our nation and our future.
I know Bernie well. He‚Äôs a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it‚Äôs hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won‚Äôt try to. 
As Jewish families across America and around the world prepare to observe the first night of Passover, Jill and I want to say chag sameach, and offer our very best wishes, to all who are celebrating. 
It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need. Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act to deliver these life-saving supplies. 
We‚Äôre starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution‚Äîwhich disproportionately affects communities of color ; low-income communities‚Äîis linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is. 
The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we‚Äôve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger ‚Äî and we will again.
Folks, I know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter ‚Äî and what a difference it makes who is in the White House. If you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. I would really appreciate it.
