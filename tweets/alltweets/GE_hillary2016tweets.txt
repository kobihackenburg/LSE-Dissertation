 This Muslim ban is...literally still on Donald Trump's website right now.   
The vast majority of Muslim Americans want to help fight terrorism. We are not at war with Islam.Trump is playing into terrorists' hands.

 Donald Trump's healthcare plan: "something terrific."That's it.Seriously. It's gonna be so good.

If Hillary tried to fact-check Donald in real time, she wouldn't have time for anything else. So, here:  
Trump owes President Obama an apology for his years-long racist conspiracy. And by the way: "Sorry if you were offended" doesn't count.
 Trust me; what we’re hearing from Donald isn’t just “locker room” talk—it’s demeaning, and it’s wrong. 
Mocking a disabled reporter. Attacking a Gold Star family. Insulting a judge. Trump has never apologized—because that's just who Trump is.
“I want to send a message: America is already great, but we are great because we are good.”  
 Donald Trump's pattern of behavior with women, as described by Donald Trump...decades ago.  
Trump has said that the video doesn't represent who he is. Anyone who heard it knows it's exactly who he is.But that's not who we are.
"I have great respect for women."  who said all of these things.  
We are going to respect each other, lift each other up, and celebrate our diversity.   
If we work together—if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another—there's nothing we can't do. 
Let's go.

Hillary’s speaking in Florida on her plan to expand opportunities for national service. Watch here: 
 Alicia merece respeto por enfrentar con valentía los ataques de Trump. ¿Y él tiene el descaro de culparla y decir que él l…
While Donald continues day 5 of his Machado meltdown, we'll be in Florida talking about national service. You'll want to watch.
Trump on equal pay: "Do as good a job" as men.Abortion? Should be "punished."Pregnancy? An "inconvenience."Wives working? "Dangerous."
We've heard Donald's insults for years, and his policies reflect this disregard—even contempt—for women.
Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell—an accomplished actor. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight—when she was pregnant. Pathetic.
To Donald, women like Alicia are only as valuable as his personal opinion about their looks.  
When something gets under Donald's thin skin, he lashes out and can't let go. This is dangerous for a president.
Alicia deserves praise for courageously standing up to Trump's attacks. And he has the gall to blame her—and say he "helped"?
What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?
This is...unhinged, even for Trump. A few notes. 
 NEW: Fdn, totally reliant on other people's $, lacks state certification to raise $ from others. 
 USA TODAY's Editorial Board: Trump unfit to lead  
Only one candidate in this election has actual plans to help middle-class families:  
"Men and women.Young and old.Gay and straight.Native-born and immigrant.That's who the hell we are."  
We have to face the hard truths about race in America. 
“This is not me just going through the motions here.I really, really, really want to elect Hillary.”   
Trump "can run his campaign however he chooses...I’m going to keep talking about the stakes in this election.” 
"I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000.” —Hillary

Trump appears to have broken the law and acted against our nation's interest, all so he could line his own pockets.  
We can’t do any of these things without your help.Our future is on the ballot.Let's prove that  
A four-year college should not be the only path to a middle-class life: 
Let’s make college tuition-free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less and debt-free for everyone. 
No parent should pay more than 10% of their income on quality child care.
We need to raise the minimum wage so nobody who works full-time is still in poverty: 
We need to bring technical education back to our schools: 
As president Hillary will stand up for kids and families. She’s done it her whole life:

At Monday's debate, Trump denied saying a lot of the things he's said. Let's set the record straight. 
With a mother in the Oval Office, we may finally catch up to the rest of the world on paid leave. 
"If a candidate regularly and flippantly makes cruel and insulting comments about women...that's who that candidate really is."  
"The president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can’t command his own rhetoric."

Donald Trump's "cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.”  
 Barack Obama is your president too.

Donald Trump is more concerned with pandering to the gun lobby than keeping families safe.

We have to stand up to this hate.We have to send a clear message: America is better than this.America is better than Donald Trump.
We're facing a candidate with a history of discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, and led the birther movement.
In a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside-in and the inside-out.
Simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. 
 No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. 
 "No one will work harder to make your life better. I’ll never stop, no matter how tough it gets." —Hillary 
When Americans get knocked down, we get right back up again. We refuse to quit—no matter what. That’s the spirit we need in this election.
We have a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like we’ve never seen before.
College should be tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone: 
If you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
We can build a cleaner, more resilient electrical grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country.
It’s wrong to tear each other down.It’s wrong to let income inequality get worse.It’s wrong to put a loose cannon in charge.
This election isn’t a reality TV show. It shouldn’t be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get on cable news.
You want something to vote for, not just against:Optimism, not resentment.Answers, not anger.Ideas, not insults.Bridges, not walls.

126 things Donald Trump has said and done that should disqualify his candidacy: 
Trump's habit of projecting his actions onto someone else is what 6-year-olds call "I know you are, but what am I?" 
Donald Trump has spent years peddling lies about President Obama.And that didn't stop today. 
Donald Trump spent five years lying about citizenship. He can’t just take that back.

What Trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. Apologize to the President, and to the American people.
Trump’s birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career. Can't be undone.
The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten.
Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African American president. He can't just take it back.
This shouldn't have to be said: You don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. It doesn’t work. No one buys it.
Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it "projecting." Kids call it "I'm rubber, you're glue." 
When Trump tries to deflect blame for denying that was born in America, he is lying.  
Leading the birther movement is deplorable. Attempting to say it "did a great service" to the president who Trump attacked is asinine.
Expressing zero regret for years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory, Trump again appointed himself judge ; jury on citizenship.
What Trump just did is a disgrace.
 It's been 5 years, and Trump's still pushing the notion that isn't American. 
 My dad was born in Poland. Do you know how many people ever asked me whether or not I was born in America? Nobody ever aske…

Donald Trump is unfit to be president.We just can’t accept this.We’ve got to stand up to this.If we don’t, it won’t stop.
Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple.Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.
Just yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States.
"We know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president.” —Hillary
The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years.The future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance. 
"We’ll remember the pain of the Mothers of the Movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice.” —Hillary
“The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against.” —Hillary 
"You don't just deserve a seat at the table. It's past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting." —Hillary to the Black Women’s Agenda

America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look or worship a certain way.
Despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals.
No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if mom or dad will be there when they get home.
"We have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn’t just the smart thing to do—it’s what the American people demand."
Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable child care isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.
It's wrong when Latinos are 17% of our population and hold only 2% of its wealth.We've got to connect more Latinos with good jobs.

This is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for those who look or love or worship one way—for all.
We need to work together to keep our country and our citizens safe.None of this will be helped by anything Trump has to offer.
People can’t board planes with full shampoo bottles—but people being watched by the FBI for terrorism can buy a gun, no questions asked?
We need a Commander-in-Chief who can grapple with our challenges in all their complexity, with real plans that actually address them.
Trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
"He said I’ll abolish the 2nd Amendment. Wrong. He said I’ll let a flood of refugees into our country without any screening. Also wrong."
Trump's Muslim ban is wrong, dangerous, and in this instance, nonsensical. The terrorist in Orlando was born in Queens—just like Donald.
"If Donald suggests I won’t call this threat what it is, he hasn’t been listening. But I will not declare war on an entire religion."
"It matters what we do, not just what we say. It didn’t matter what we called bin Laden—it mattered that we got bin Laden." —Hillary
Americans don’t need conspiracy theories and pathological self-congratulations. We need leadership, common sense, and concrete plans.
Trump's rhetoric is shameful.It was one thing when he was a reality TV personality. It’s another when he’s running for president.
People of different faiths, backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities are coming together to say: we won’t let hate defeat us.

"I have no doubt we can meet this challenge — if we meet it together."Hillary's address on the Orlando attack: 
"A nightmare that’s become mind-numbingly familiar." Hillary on the deadliest shooting in U.S. history: 
Weapons of war like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino have no place on our streets.
Tenemos que unirnos, sentir orgullo juntos. No hay mejor respuesta para los terroristas y a todos aquellos que odian 
Our diversity isn’t a liability in the fight against terrorism. It’s an asset. It makes us stronger.

We have to stand together and be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate. 
Our open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability. It makes us stronger.
We’ve seen too many examples of the struggle to live freely, openly, and without fear being marked by violence. We have to stand together.
"To all the LGBT people grieving today: you have millions of allies who will always have your back. I am one of them." —Hillary
The terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. An attack on any American is an attack on all Americans.
Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. It’s wrong, and it's dangerous.
Background checks and an assault weapons ban might not stop every attack—but they'll stop some, and save lives. We need to fight for them.
In Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons like the AR-15 to kill Americans. We should make it harder for them to do so.
If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn’t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.
We need to stop terrorists from getting the weapons they need to carry out attacks. 
"As president, I will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority." —Hillary on her counterterrorism strategy
The murder of innocent people always breaks our hearts, scares us, and makes us furious. Now we have to steel our resolve and respond.

Desperté con la devastadora noticia de FL. Mientras esperamos más información,mis pensamientos están con los afectados de este horrible acto
Woke up to hear the devastating news from FL. As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act. -H
Donald Trump considers his shuttered casinos a success because HE made millions.A man who thinks that way has no business being president.
When Trump's casinos failed, he hurt a whole universe of small businesses that never got paid what they were owed. 
When Trump had to make an $18 million interest payment, his dad had to bail him out by buying $3 million in chips: 
During a decade when other casinos in Atlantic City thrived, Trump's posted huge losses:  
Trump the businessman? A total failure. He bankrupted his Atlantic City casinos (but pocketed millions for himself): 
"Sec. Clinton will be the strong environmental champion that we need to lead our country."

“Ella tiene la valentía, la compasión y el corazón para realizar el trabajo”. Mira el mensaje del presidente Obama.
We’re not just going to break the glass ceiling. We’re going to break down all the barriers that hold back women and their families.
Trump has called women “pigs,” “dogs,” and “disgusting animals.”We can't even count on him to respect women—much less protect our rights.
Trump says he'd be "the best for women."Anyone who'd defund and wipe out safe, legal abortion has no idea what’s best for women.
Laws that restrict access to abortion don’t make women less likely to seek it—they just make women less safe. 
Defending women’s health means defending access to safe, legal abortion for all who need it—not just women who can afford it.
The Hyde Amendment restricts the reproductive rights of low-income women—disproportionately women of color. We need to repeal it now.
Ever notice the politicians who oppose birth control and abortion also oppose policies that make it easier to raise a child—like paid leave?

A note from Hillary. 
 My 8 year old said "See Mom, it's true, anything is possible."  
A headline 227 years in the making.  
 This AM I told my 5-yo daughter we could elect the first woman President. She said, “OK, I’ll be the 2nd woman President…
History.  
Front pages from around the country on a big day.  
If Hillary could go back in time and tell anyone she'd been nominated for president, it would be her mom. 
 Speaking is hard for me. But come January, I want to say these two words: "Madam President."

"On the very day Mom was being born in Chicago, Congress was passing the 19th Amendment to the Constitution—giving women the right to vote."
"We are stronger when we respect each other, listen to each other, and act with a sense of common purpose." —Hillary
This election isn’t about the same old fights between Democrats and Republicans—it’s about who we are as Americans. 
We should lift each other up—not tear each other down. To be great, we can’t be small. We have to be as big as the values that define us.
Unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls. 
“Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president and Commander-in-Chief.” —Hillary
It’s a simple but powerful idea. We are fairer together. We are better together. We are stronger together. 
"Whether you supported me in this primary, or Senator Sanders, we all need to keep working toward that better, fairer, stronger America."
"As your president, I will always have your back." —Hillary
We reached this moment thanks to the struggle and sacrifice of generations of women and men before us.
For the first time in our history, a woman will be a major party’s nominee for President of the United States.
