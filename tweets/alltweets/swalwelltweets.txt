 Standing outside NRA headquarters now waiting for to make his policy announcement on ending gun violence‚Ä¶
I'm a rare breed of Country-music-loving-Democrat.
This is why ending gun violence will always be my top priority as a candidate and as president.I'm not crying. You're crying.
Hopelessness and fear abound in too many American neighborhoods. We will restore hope and end gun violence with my gun reform platform. More tomorrow... 
‚ÄúExcluding suicide‚Äù ‚Äî as if they don‚Äôt matter. All gun deaths were a loss. 
No more thoughts and prayers. No more inaction. We will seize the moment and take ACTION to end gun violence.Tomorrow we'll be announcing exactly how. Stay tuned... 
Ending gun violence is my top priority as a candidate and will be my top priority as president. 
Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there! May we one day be as cool as our kids... 
We WILL end gun violence. Every child has a right to walk the streets or go to school without fear. 
If you need a license to operate a vehicle, shouldn't you need a license to operate a weapon?

Iowans care about ending gun violence. Americans care about ending gun violence.I am the only candidate calling for a  of military-style assault weapons; I will be your champion for this issue. 
My wife and I battle insurance companies, pay off my student loans, and care about the safety of our kids at school.My issues are your issues. 
Thank you for having me! I'm not even ashamed of my hot pop culture take...
Thanks to and the amazing crowd at the last night for a great discussion! 
Put a young father in the White House and you'll have someone who understands your concerns and fights for you.And who can also change a mean diaper...

Help Penny get to the White House with your pennies! All it takes is $1 to get us out of these ruff times: 
We need to show Donald Trump that there are consequences to his actions. Enough is enough. 
We need to hold this president accountable so that more lawlessness does not pervade our country. 
 I‚Äôve seen restraining orders granted for less obsessive behavior. But God Bless America and this poor guy‚Äôs right to obsess over me.
Trump's conduct during the 2016 election was done with intent. His conduct for any future election will be done with intent. Our democracy is at risk. 
There's an urgency to act NOW. We cannot wait any longer. We must open an impeachment inquiry. 
The president continues to betray America. His statement that he would accept a foreign power‚Äôs offer of information harmful to an electoral rival, and probably not inform the FBI of such an effort, shouldn‚Äôt be shocking‚Äîbecause he already did it.
We had an amazing public forum on ending gun violence in Nevada yesterday!This is my top priority and I will make it our country's top priority. 
I stand in solidarity with Detroit security officers in their  and their right to a union.  
$1 could be the difference between 4 more years of Trump or CHANGE‚Ä¶ Are you ready for something better? 
After hearing the president say, flat-out, that he would accept a foreign power‚Äôs offer of dirt on an electoral competitor and probably not inform the FBI of such an effort, I believe that Congress must pursue impeachment.
We need Republicans to be our allies and join us to bring witnesses in to fully understand the obstruction and corruption happening right now in our democracy. 
History doesn't repeat itself, it rhymes. What we heard sounds a lot like the Nixon administration...

The Hyde Amendment prevents women on Medicaid from exercising their right to choose an abortion. We should all be on board with repealing it, so that every woman can have a choice over her own body, without insurance getting in the way.

As the brother of two cops, I'm keeping police safety in mind but moving firmly forward to address racial injustice and police use of force in communities of color. 
Here's the question we face: do we want to just stop the bleeding or do we want to stop the shootings altogether?I'm running to stop the shootings 
After each mass shooting the had a chance to help enact gun safety reforms. Instead, they stoked a fear of ‚Äúconfiscation‚Äù to raise $ from their members ‚Äî $ to pay themselves. Not only did they let more kids die, they never really cared about  It was always about the $. 
Moments of silence are an alibi for doing nothing. Our campaign is going to do something and take ACTION to end gun violence. 
One of the main takeaways from Mueller is the number of contacts ; just the multiplicity of contacts that the president, his family, his business, his campaign, has with the Russians. At every turn there was a Russian ; there was someone on the Trump team.
My prediction is that there will never be a presidential campaign, there will never be a Democratic field after this one, where a campaign is not organized. It‚Äôs going to be the new standard, and anyone that doesn‚Äôt do that is going to stand out.
 ‚ÄúI think ending gun violence has to be the number one issue for the next president because it‚Äôs the most important issue‚Ä¶
They‚Äôre running b/c DC has failed to protect them. They‚Äôre running because there was just as great of chance it was a mass shooting as anything else. I‚Äôm RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT because we don‚Äôt have to live in fear if we get every assault weapon off our streets.

AG Barr has undermined our democracy  your help, we can restore TRUTH and TRANSPARENCY in the White House. All it takes is $1. Are you ready for change? 
Do you think AG Barr really read the report?Doesn't appear so... 
AG Barr is obstructing in real time right now. We need an independent Attorney General, who doesn't put the President above the law and above the American people. I'm calling on my colleagues to join me in starting impeachment proceedings against William Barr. 
The Attorney General has chosen to be the President‚Äôs lawyer rather than yours. There‚Äôs only one remedy: impeachment. 
It's time to impeach Attorney General Barr. 
REMINDER: The Attorney General works for US. Not the President.I could see how that would get lost in confusion, given his actions.
What do you do when the Attorney General of the United States... 1) Prejudges an investigation report?2) Accuses the FBI of lying?3) Lies to Congress?4) Refuses to comply with a subpoena?...all to protect the President? There's only one thing left to do. Impeach him.
This is not just about holding the Attorney General accountable. This is about putting new laws on the books to prevent this from becoming our new normal in America.That is why ; I have co-sponsored the  Act, so our democracy isn't undermined again.
Barr apparently did not even read the full Mueller report. That's all you need to know to determine that he is unfit to hold the position of Attorney General, and frankly, to be an attorney at all. He must be impeached.
Attorney General William Barr has passed the red line for me and for most Americans. He has obstructed justice and put his President's interests over our rule of law. No one is above the law. Not me, not you, not the President. Especially not the President.
AG Barr has been obstructing in real time. We need an independent Attorney General who will hold this administration accountable.
There is only one thing left to do now. The Attorney General must be impeached.
