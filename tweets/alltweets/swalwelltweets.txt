Thanks to and the amazing crowd at the last night for a great discussion! 
Put a young father in the White House and you'll have someone who understands your concerns and fights for you.And who can also change a mean diaper...

Because he doesn’t think he’s ever leaving. Like ever. Only one way to stop that is to overwhelm the ballot box. *Or, schedule a tee time and change the locks. 🤷‍♂️ 
I hope that Senator Graham will sign onto my Duty to Report Act, requiring that if a foreign power offers you "dirt" on an electoral opponent, you must tell the FBI. 
 We love your movies. And can’t wait for the sequel!

We're on the right course. We will uphold the rule of law. This will come to a crescendo...and one that does not sound well for the President.

Help Penny get to the White House with your pennies! All it takes is $1 to get us out of these ruff times: 
We need to show Donald Trump that there are consequences to his actions. Enough is enough. 
We need to hold this president accountable so that more lawlessness does not pervade our country. 
 I’ve seen restraining orders granted for less obsessive behavior. But God Bless America and this poor guy’s right to obsess over me.
Trump's conduct during the 2016 election was done with intent. His conduct for any future election will be done with intent. Our democracy is at risk. 
There's an urgency to act NOW. We cannot wait any longer. We must open an impeachment inquiry. 
The president continues to betray America. His statement that he would accept a foreign power’s offer of information harmful to an electoral rival, and probably not inform the FBI of such an effort, shouldn’t be shocking—because he already did it.
We had an amazing public forum on ending gun violence in Nevada yesterday!This is my top priority and I will make it our country's top priority. 
I stand in solidarity with Detroit security officers in their  and their right to a union.  
$1 could be the difference between 4 more years of Trump or CHANGE… Are you ready for something better? 
After hearing the president say, flat-out, that he would accept a foreign power’s offer of dirt on an electoral competitor and probably not inform the FBI of such an effort, I believe that Congress must pursue impeachment.
We need Republicans to be our allies and join us to bring witnesses in to fully understand the obstruction and corruption happening right now in our democracy. 
History doesn't repeat itself, it rhymes. What we heard sounds a lot like the Nixon administration...

The Hyde Amendment prevents women on Medicaid from exercising their right to choose an abortion. We should all be on board with repealing it, so that every woman can have a choice over her own body, without insurance getting in the way. 
 Happy to have Rep. Eric Swalwell on today’s show, 5:05 ET, as we continue to interview 2020 Democratic presidential candida…
I had the honor of meeting members of the Hunger 9 at our End Gun Violence Town Hall. Richard Sr. said it best, "Let’s stop the violence. Let’s stop this killing one another for senseless reasons. We need to talk to each other and solve the problem."
 I’m supporting many of the democratic candidates because they all bring new voices, ideas and people into the process,

We need to get weapons of war off our streets and out of our communities. We need to  every assault weapon in America. And we need to keep our children safe from violence and fear.I will fight for this. Will you join me? Click here ▶️  
As the brother of two cops, I'm keeping police safety in mind but moving firmly forward to address racial injustice and police use of force in communities of color. 
Here's the question we face: do we want to just stop the bleeding or do we want to stop the shootings altogether?I'm running to stop the shootings 
After each mass shooting the had a chance to help enact gun safety reforms. Instead, they stoked a fear of “confiscation” to raise $ from their members — $ to pay themselves. Not only did they let more kids die, they never really cared about  It was always about the $. 
Moments of silence are an alibi for doing nothing. Our campaign is going to do something and take ACTION to end gun violence. 
One of the main takeaways from Mueller is the number of contacts ; just the multiplicity of contacts that the president, his family, his business, his campaign, has with the Russians. At every turn there was a Russian ; there was someone on the Trump team.
My prediction is that there will never be a presidential campaign, there will never be a Democratic field after this one, where a campaign is not organized. It’s going to be the new standard, and anyone that doesn’t do that is going to stand out.
 “I think ending gun violence has to be the number one issue for the next president because it’s the most important issue…
They’re running b/c DC has failed to protect them. They’re running because there was just as great of chance it was a mass shooting as anything else. I’m RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT because we don’t have to live in fear if we get every assault weapon off our streets.

Outside corporate spending and Super PACs prevent big things from happening in Congress, even when a majority of Americans agrees on something. 
 
I’m the only 2020 candidate to make ending gun violence the top policy priority. Of course our first television ad should underscore this commitment.  
I carry around this insulin vial that one of my constituents gave me so that I can carry the burden that everyday Americans face every day when paying for prescription drugs and treatments. 
I wear this orange ribbon today and every day because ending gun violence needs to be the number one issue for the next president.

If a state doesn't recognize the human rights of half of our population, why should businesses financially support that assault?
We have a lawless president. First things first, we need to impeach the attorney general and Secretary Mnuchin-- they are front door obstructors.
Raise your hand if you think prescription drugs cost too much and healthcare is eating up your paycheck 🙋 🙋‍♂️ 
Thank you, — lets all agree  
Entertainment? Are you kidding me? thinks we need assault weapons for “entertainment.” What a sick, sick man. There’s nothing entertaining about dead children. It’s time to ban this “entertainment.”

I’ll save you some time and money, AG Barr. The guy who appointed you had an overseas aide who was previewed a Russia hacking operation. That same guy’s son then met with Russians offering dirt. Oh, one more. That same guy, asked Russia to hack more emails.  
No President should have immunity from the law. 
Wishing President Carter a swift recovery! 
My late night craving is a spoonful of peanut butter. Trying to be healthier, I recently bought the “reduced fat” jar of Jif. I’ll have the fat back, please.

I learned a lot from Scott — like putting tourniquets on blocks w/ the most shootings saves more lives (sad, but right). Also, “we can mourn the victims but we also must understand how the shooter got a gun ; why they fired it.” Harder, but that’s what it’ll take.  
Learning from those on the front lines about the damage gun violence does to victims’ bodies and the fabric of our communities. This is  the Trauma Outreach Coordinator at Temple University Hospital. He has counseled over 7K gunshot victims and their families.

Trump isn't getting off scot-free. We want to make sure that presidents don’t become immune to criminal charges altogether, simply because they can’t be indicted while in office.
$1 could mean the end of Donald Trump. Are you ready?? 
I have been dismayed that many of the articles discussing candidates' dogs have not used an image of our Penny. Hopefully this photo will turn the tide...I won't give up until Penny gets the attention she deserves, so please stand by for more pup pics. 
It's a basic American value that no one, not even the President, is above the law ; I have intro'd the No President Is Above the Law Act to pause the statute of limitations for any federal crime committed by a sitting president. It's just common sense.

Why do we need the full Mueller report from AG Barr? We were attacked.The most BASIC function of government is to protect its people from foreign attack.If we let Barr neglect that obligation - or flat out refuse it - then we are not actually a government.

Whoopsie daisies...Gun reforms in Australia actually proved that gun ownership could still coincide with reasonable and lasting changes in gun laws.
 Pink and white. Not even a close call.
They (the NRA) hate me because they know I’m not the bogeyman they want ... I feel comfortable shooting guns. I do shoot guns. I think that they want the person who is proposing tougher gun laws to be someone who’s never handled a gun before.
There are 15 million assault weapons in America. A ban on future sales does ZERO to protect us from the 15 million out there. Here’s my plan: BAN ; BUY-BACK all of them OR restrict possession to a range/hunting club. I’m the only candidate calling for this. 
If I'm going to be known as the candidate who wanted to save lives and save our democracy, then so be it...

Here's what happens if we hold Barr in contempt:
Fact 👇🏼 
Attorney General Barr has a lot to hide. Why else would he refuse to show up? Was he scared the questions might be hard? Was he worried what might come out? How many bodies is he hiding for the President?The American people deserve to know.

AG Barr has undermined our democracy  your help, we can restore TRUTH and TRANSPARENCY in the White House. All it takes is $1. Are you ready for change? 
Do you think AG Barr really read the report?Doesn't appear so... 
AG Barr is obstructing in real time right now. We need an independent Attorney General, who doesn't put the President above the law and above the American people. I'm calling on my colleagues to join me in starting impeachment proceedings against William Barr. 
The Attorney General has chosen to be the President’s lawyer rather than yours. There’s only one remedy: impeachment. 
It's time to impeach Attorney General Barr. 
REMINDER: The Attorney General works for US. Not the President.I could see how that would get lost in confusion, given his actions.
What do you do when the Attorney General of the United States... 1) Prejudges an investigation report?2) Accuses the FBI of lying?3) Lies to Congress?4) Refuses to comply with a subpoena?...all to protect the President? There's only one thing left to do. Impeach him.
This is not just about holding the Attorney General accountable. This is about putting new laws on the books to prevent this from becoming our new normal in America.That is why ; I have co-sponsored the  Act, so our democracy isn't undermined again.
Barr apparently did not even read the full Mueller report. That's all you need to know to determine that he is unfit to hold the position of Attorney General, and frankly, to be an attorney at all. He must be impeached.
Attorney General William Barr has passed the red line for me and for most Americans. He has obstructed justice and put his President's interests over our rule of law. No one is above the law. Not me, not you, not the President. Especially not the President.
AG Barr has been obstructing in real time. We need an independent Attorney General who will hold this administration accountable.
There is only one thing left to do now. The Attorney General must be impeached.
Sounds like a challenge...

I was suspicious of AG Barr LAST MONTH and called for him to resign then. Today, I’m beyond certain he cannot credibly continue as America’s Attorney General.  
Agreed.

What said this weekend about women and their right to choose was disgusting and dangerous. I will always support a woman's right over her own body, and $1 could mean the end of Donald Trump. Are you ready??

As an Iowa native, I know what issues are most important to Iowans - and better yet, I know how to solve them.
 Agree, sir! Please see my May 2018 proposal: 
This weekend in Iowa, a county sheriff shared with me his concerns about assault rifles. He said, “we were finding there were so many in our community that I had to buy each of our deputies one. It’s ridiculous.” Let’s ban them. To protect you and our cops. 
Help me become our nominee and I’ll help our candidate  Just $1 gets me to the 1st debate: 
Trump's claims that babies are "executed" are not only FALSE but dangerous for the women in our country. We must protect a woman's right over her own body and the right to choose. These are HUMAN rights that every single woman deserves.
Love it! Appreciate the support 👊 
I'm going to be the cures candidate. No more "sickcare" - we are going to invest in technology and innovation to find cures in our lifetime.

Thanks,
America is on a needless carousel of grief.  we hope your victims survive and wish peace for the victims’ families. 
My heart beats for the  victims, but my blood boils over the sick ritual: assault rifle used to attack parishioners, empty thoughts ; prayers from then no action taken to prevent another shooting. It’s NEVER too early to say 
"His debt proposals are more radical, but he is in favor of free college if students participate in work-study while at a public university ; commit to some form of community service after college" It's not "radical" to oppose life-long college debt. 
Are you better off with Trump? You know and I know you aren't. You were lied to. We can do better! 
As Nas said, "Trust your own judgment. Live with it. And love it." 
Ban ; buy-back 
What 'til you see what I DO!
 Not yet, but Peter let’s do it!
OUR Attorney General acts as Trump’s defense attorney. He can’t be both. Barr must resign 
Spare us your thoughts and prayers. It’s an alibi for inaction. You told the NRA yesterday you’d keep dangerous guns in the hands of dangerous people. We will take it from here with action. 
Houses of worship are supposed to be safe havens in our communities. However, with unrestricted weaponry in America, they are no longer. Mourning those lost today in Poway, CA and praying for those who have been injured. We will honor them with action.
We have a bad kid in the White House. I give my toddler a time out when he misbehaves. We need to hold our President accountable for his actions.

I've cracked the code of the they are a vocal, tweeting minority.Most Americans are with us. 
While the is hosting their convention today, remember that: The NRA deals in threats, propaganda, anger and fear to cling to its now-waning power. The goal is to scare us into inaction, but we won’t be deterred.
The conference is today. THIS is why we're fighting. THIS is who they're up against. THIS is our moment to make change.

When you:1️⃣ Seek help from the Russians and lie about it;2️⃣ Refuse to show your taxes; and 3️⃣ Direct your staff not to follow lawful subpoenas...You’re not a Commander-in-ChiefYou’re a Commander-in-Cheat 
We're not going to do "Donald Trump Justice," we're going to bring Mueller in, get the full unredacted report, and do this the right way.Trump's days are numbered.

Do we even know if the President's inappropriate relationship with Russia has stopped? We should all be concerned and remain vigilant.

No one wants to re-litigate the 2016 election, but we need to make sure nothing like this ever happens again. That's why I wrote legislation called Duty to Report: to make sure that if a foreign adversary contacts a campaign, they have a duty to tell the FBI.

Making threats is the lowest form of communication.If your response to a lawmaker proposing to change gun laws is to threaten to kill that lawmaker, you are proving why we need better laws on firearm possession in America. 
You think you deter me? You think the mothers of dead children are going to stop asking for gun safety laws? You think the students who lost friends will quit marching. You can point the biggest gun you want at us. We.Aren’t.Going.Away. 
No more negotiating down on gun safety. Mass shooting after mass shooting and Washington does nothing. Yet, Americans know what we should do. Be bold. Ban and buy back the assault weapons. Background checks. Gang violence prevention programs.

We need to protect future elections and the future of our democracy. We need to hear from Mueller himself. 
I denounce New Hampshire's House Bill 1264. No poll tax for students; every American must have a voice at the ballot box and in our democracy. 
We need to hear from Mueller himself before we rule out impeachment. End of story. 
We remember the 4 lives stolen one year ago today in the Nashville Waffle House shooting.We do a disservice to those who lost their lives and to our country if we don't ban military-style assault weapons.

This is like having termites in your house and we’ve just found out finally how much rot there is. The campaign, the family, the business, the transition in the administration all approached by Russians? It was eye-opening.
For perspective: when  happened it was the 5th-deadliest mass shooting in the US since WWII. Today it is not even in the top ten. 
20 yrs later, we remember the  victims. Sadly, it hasn’t become harder for the most dangerous people to get the most dangerous weapons. It’s become easier. We can protect our kids in their classrooms with:✅Background Checks✅Assault weapons ban✅Anti-gang programs

If Barr believed in the rule of law, he’d let the report speak for itself, not hold a news conference to spin it on the President’s behalf.
Very interesting press conference by Trump...I mean, Barr.
Russia DID influence our election. We need to read the full, unredacted report and take action to guarantee this doesn't happen in 2020.
No one is above the rule of law...unless you're frustrated, that is 🙄
