Our representatives in Texas have left us open to these kinds of attacks. Time to change our representatives. 
 3,500+ Texans are killed by guns every year: a life lost every 3 hours.If more guns and fewer gun laws made Texas safe‚Ä¶
All the strength and all the love to John Lewis. He‚Äôs been leading people into ‚Äúgood trouble‚Äù and leading this country closer to its ideals of justice and equality his whole life. We‚Äôre with you John!!
So saddened to hear about another church shooting in Texas, this one in White Settlement near Fort Worth. Clearly what we are doing in Texas, what we are doing in this country, when it comes to guns is not working. 
Sending love and strength to the victims and their families after the anti-Semitic attack in Monsey.
Merry Christmas!

Americans shouldn‚Äôt have to fear being killed by those sworn to serve and protect us. Full prosecution of this murder is the kind of accountability we need to stop police from continuing to shoot innocent black women and men. 
Our focus: registering Texans to vote, knocking on doors, making phone calls, and connecting the dots so that we understand that in order to make progress on the issues we care most about ‚Äî like gun violence, healthcare and climate ‚Äî we have to register, volunteer and vote.
Powered by People helps Texans volunteer in critical races. Organizing grassroots volunteers is how we win the state house, overcome racist gerrymandering, defeat John Cornyn ; help our Presidential nominee win Texas‚Äô 38 electoral college votes. Join us! 
Check out this principled, courageous candidate who is running like a mother for the Texas state house. If Jennifer wins this race we‚Äôll be another seat closer to a Democratic majority. 
Don‚Äôt let the cynicism and punditry and ‚Äúpartisan fight‚Äù bullshit in. Today this country stood up for itself through our representatives in Congress who wouldn‚Äôt allow democracy to die at the hands of a would-be tyrant. Grateful to everyone who had the guts to do the right thing.
Gotta celebrate gun sense victories when we can. Overcoming inertia ; the NRA, Congress voted to study gun violence for the first time in 20 years. Armed with the facts, it will be harder for them to fail to move on background checks, ERPO and VAWA. 
With the amazing and Women‚Äôs Center leadership in Fort Bend county. We discussed the connection between domestic violence and gun violence and the need to have courageous common sense leadership in the state house ‚Äî 
Knocking doors with who is running to serve Fort Bend in the Texas House. She‚Äôs going to be a strong voice ; vote on education, gun violence, healthcare and climate.  
 This is what it‚Äôs all about. And yet, basically no one has even seen these figures. We need to communicate this everywhe‚Ä¶
‚ÄúEvery day, 100 Americans are shot and killed, and hundreds more are wounded. Many more live having witnessed an event. This is not the price we pay for our country‚Äôs freedom.‚Äù The extraordinarily powerful  
If we let Trump get away with abuse of power and contempt of Congress, then we replace the precedent of a commander-in-chief who chose the republic over his own ambition with that of a petty tyrant who puts his interests before those of the nation. 
Victory for rule of law and a more humane border. Thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have died as militarization and walls push them to ever more hostile stretches of the U.S.-MX border.  
 This is America. The only high income country in the world that allows gun lobbyists to write its nation‚Äôs gun laws. J‚Ä¶
Here‚Äôs a guy who represents a district Trump won in ‚Äò16. He‚Äôs putting his responsibility to the country, the constitution and rule of law ahead of what‚Äôs politically convenient or popular. This is what America needs right now. 
This is leadership on gun violence. 
Great news for Texas and the country. Sima is one of the smartest, hardest working people I‚Äôve met. She helped produce record turnout in 2018 in Texas for my campaign and will beat Crenshaw in 2020 in hers! 
A lone dissenting voice in Congress in 2001, urging us not to rush into war in Afghanistan. 18 years, a trillion dollars, 2,300 U.S. service members killed later, important to remember Barbara Lee was one of the few willing to tell the truth: 
Excellent reporting. This is how our democracy is supposed to work. Informed Americans will demand an end to this and the other wars we are in and will work to stop us from starting new ones.  
 Never in my lifetime did I think I‚Äôd see a United States Senator spread Russian propaganda on national television. htt‚Ä¶
To the Republicans in the House, I‚Äôve worked with many of you and know that you care about this country. Do the right thing. History and future generations of Americans will honor your courage on behalf of our country, even if Trump does not.
If Trump‚Äôs defenders in Congress succeed, we will be a democracy in name only. A nominal republic, ruled by strongmen and thugs.
Not only will Trump have a green light to again welcome Russia and other foreign powers to undermine our democracy, but it will also mean that future Presidents and candidates will do the same. The excuse will be, my predecessor did it, my opponent is doing it, why shouldn‚Äôt I?
Trump‚Äôs apologists in Congress are working to establish the precedent that the President is above the law, above the constitution and that he can freely welcome foreign intervention into our elections.
Harder to find information on state house reps - if you have this for your state can you include link in reply to this thread?
Here‚Äôs a cheat sheet to find out how members of Congress have voted ‚Äî thanks to for putting it together: 
2019 so far: - 391 mass shootings in 340 days- 438 people killed in them, over 1,500 injured - 281 days since the House passed gun safety legislation.Is your State or Congressional rep fighting for background checks, extreme risk protection orders ; assualt weapons ban?
- CBP held Carlos for 6 days, though supposed to transfer children within 72 hours.- 6th migrant child to die after being detained while entering the U.S. in less than a year.- None had died in custody over previous decade.

NO ONE should be getting rich off of depriving people of their liberty or their lives. McKinsey, GEO Group, CCA/CoreCivic, etc all have a profit incentive to deport, detain, dehumanize. Lets get corporations completely out of immigration and criminal justice.
Hold McKinsey accountable for profiting on human misery and facilitating Trump‚Äôs hateful treatment of asylum seekers that has produced so much suffering and death. McKinsey should never receive another government contract here or anywhere else. 
Grateful to Kamala for her service, her candidacy and for all of the great things she‚Äôs going to do in the future. Amy and I got to know Kamala and Doug on the campaign trail, impressed by their kindness to us and their great sense of humor in the midst of incredible pressure.
We win nine seats in the TX legislature, Dems will have a majority. That means an end to racist gerrymandering, a chance to address gun violence, reproductive rights, Medicaid expansion, ; climate change in Texas. Will be positive for Congressional ; Presidential races as well.
Last year 17 TX State House Republicans won their election by less than 10 points. We can flip these seats by reaching un-registered Democrats. Your donation will be used to send them pre-filled voter registration forms w/ stamped return envelope. 
The consequences of climate change are painful now, but they get much worse the longer we wait. Same is true of the policy choices. They become more expensive, more drastic, more unlikely. So, we act now or forever lose our chance.  
Of all the unlawful and dehumanizing and vicious things Donald Trump and those in his administration are responsible for, it is their treatment of children at the border - and their deaths in our custody - that will prove the greatest stain on the conscience of this country.
From a public health perspective it‚Äôs just stupid that CBP denies flu vaccine to detained migrants. Considering that three children have died of the flu in CBP custody in the last year it‚Äôs also immoral. 
‚ÄòGeorge Mason, asked, ‚ÄúShall any man be above justice?‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúShall the man who has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his guilt?‚Äù‚Äô
The story of Luis ; Marcela is inspiring. Says something about the strength of El Paso and what it takes to recover from a shooting like the one we had in August. Says something about why we have to stop gun violence and racism in America.  
 Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stays Rodney Reed‚Äôs execution 
Good news! The facts and the recommendation of the full parole board tell us we should do all we can to save this man‚Äôs life and ensure that new evidence can be presented. Let‚Äôs keep the calls coming to Gov. Abbott 512-488-0698. 
Santa Clarita, we‚Äôre with you today and every day going forward.To everyone fighting to stop this from happening in America: the days of the NRA and the members of Congress they‚Äôve purchased are coming to an end. Keep the faith, keep up the fight.  Our kids are counting on us.
Thinking about the women and men who‚Äôve served this country in uniform and then continue to serve America as veterans. At a moment that we risk being defined by our differences, you show what it means to come together in common cause, putting country first.
And for those in Austin or those who can get there, there will be a rally at the Governor‚Äôs Mansion at 2 PM tomorrow. 
Rodney Reed is days away from execution, despite new evidence that could exonerate him.  Together we can save his life, but time is running out. Tell Governor Abbott to stop the execution: 

 To our 240,000 donors, our 77,000 volunteers, and everyone across the country who believed -- We‚Äôre proud of you, Team Beto‚Ä¶
Thank you for making this campaign possible, and for continuing to believe that we can turn this moment of great peril into a moment of great promise for America and the world.
We will work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020. I can tell you firsthand from having the chance to know the candidates, we will be well served by any one of them, and I‚Äôm going to be proud to support whoever she or he is.
Let us continue to fearlessly champion the issues and causes that brought us together. Whether it is ending the epidemic of gun violence or dismantling structural racism or successfully confronting climate change, we will continue to organize and mobilize and act.
I am grateful to all the people who made up the heart and soul of this campaign. You were among the hundreds of thousands who made a donation, signed up to volunteer or spread the word about this campaign and our opportunity to help decide the election of our lifetime.
Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively. In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee. 
We can‚Äôt keep proposing half measures and hoping Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell will agree to do something about gun violence.We need to say what we believe, and defeat everyone standing in the way of us achieving it. 
We should mark the foundation of America not on July 4, 1776, but on August 20, 1619‚Äîwhen the first human beings kidnapped from Africa were brought here to build the wealth of our country. Until we acknowledge this history, and repair this damage, we cannot build a better future. 
This is a good step, but it's only the beginning. Now, it's time to impeach President Trump and remove him from office. 
A reminder: Trump's racist, xenophobic, and hate filled words inspire violence in our communities. This can't be ignored. We must connect the dots. 
 Beto O'Rourke makes a plea for transformative justice.Full interview:  
We're seeing an unprecedented attack on the ability of women to make their own decisions about their own bodies. We can't stop at nominating justices who support Roe v. Wade. We need to pass a law ensuring every woman can access an abortion, no matter her zip code. 
This campaign is about bringing everyone in and leaving no one behind.Pitch in $5, $10, $15‚Å†‚Äîanything you can‚Äîto support our people powered campaign:  
Payday lenders‚Äîwho get rich by preying on working Americans who are trying to make ends meet‚Äîbelieve our president can be bought. The worst part is: They‚Äôre right. 
When we win Texas's 38 electoral votes, we will put Donald Trump away forever. 
These victories are important, but we cannot rely on courts‚Äîwith judges appointed by Donald Trump‚Äîto protect a woman's right to choose. Congress needs to pass a bill guaranteeing access to safe and legal abortion in all 50 states.

Mass incarceration begins in kindergarten‚Äîwhen a child of color is more likely to be suspended or expelled. We need to end the school-to-prison pipeline, end for-profit prisons, end cash bail, end the War on Drugs, and bring about transformative justice. 
We can't become numb to this. We can't accept living in a world where wildfires continue to get worse‚Äîbecause of our failure to do anything about climate change. This is the defining challenge of our time; and we need to act now, before it's too late.Sending love to your state. 
 Kleo: I am so sorry for your loss‚Äîbut also so grateful you were willing to share your story. Because the only way we will overcome our epidemic of mental health challenges in this country is by opening up about them; and ensuring everyone has access to mental health care.
We need to end mass incarceration. 
With 2.3 million people behind bars, this plan prioritizes keeping people out of the justice system in the first place, invests in rehabilitation, and supports successful re-entry while reforming policing and eliminating private prisons, mandatory minimums, and cash bail.
We have the largest prison population on the face of the planet, disproportionately comprised of people of color‚Äîa consequence of racist policies. Here's our plan to end mass incarceration and reform the broken justice system: 
To those celebrating the Festival of Lights, Amy and I wish you a Happy Diwali and a joyous New Year.
Last night, our special forces brought the leader of one of history's most destructive terrorist groups to justice. Let's thank our service members for their courage; and recommit to protecting all of the allies who are working with us to defeat ISIS‚Äîincluding the Kurds.
On the one year anniversary of the Tree of Life shooting, we mourn the lives lost‚Äîand condemn the anti-Semitism, the racism, the xenophobia that not only led to this shooting, but has led to a rise in hate crimes all across our country.
My heart is with everyone in the Greenville community‚Äîbut grief cannot be our only emotion. We must also be angry, resilient, devoted to doing everything we can to end this epidemic of gun violence, before even more lives are lost to our inaction. 
Cleansing means genocide. If Turkey follows through on this, it will be on Trump‚Äôs hands, but it will also be on our country‚Äôs conscience forever. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs on all of us to speak out now‚Äîbefore it‚Äôs too late. 
We have stopped registering tweets like this‚Äîbut we can‚Äôt normalize a president who threatens to sue the principal investigator of his crimes. That‚Äôs what happens in dictatorships, not democracies. 
Your gender identity is for you to decide, and no government‚Äîlocal, state, or federal‚Äîshould stand in the way. 
The President of the United States should be working to ensure everyone has the health care they need‚Äînot to take it away from the most vulnerable among us. 
Kalief Browder spent three years in prison because he couldn‚Äôt post bail after being accused of stealing a backpack‚Äîbefore he killed himself as a result of the trauma. Felicity Huffman didn‚Äôt even serve her full 14-day sentence. 
Don't become numb to these numbers. More than 5,400 children were separated from their parents. Subject to conditions no human being should face. This was done in our names; and it's on all of us to hold accountable all who implemented this cruel policy.

We all must stand up for our trans community, just like Annie.It's long past due that we challenge the gross inequities they face. Especially trans women of color, who have been targeted and killed at extraordinary rates with impunity. 
When El Paso fell victim to hate on August 3rd, sent us his love. He will never stop fighting to end this epidemic of gun violence; and make sure our economy works for all. He will be missed in this race.
Every day, more than 130 human beings overdose on opioids. 47,000 lose their lives to this epidemic every year. We need to be there for every victim of this crisis and hold accountable everyone who created it. Here‚Äôs our plan: 
Beto Greets Cornell College Town Hall Attendees  
After Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress today, let's all come together to say: Facebook should not be able to spread lies on their platform.
We must do better for Americans like my sister. We must fully fund our special education programs and expand access to care. We must expand the Voting Rights Act to make it easier to cast their ballots.For too long, we have overlooked people with disabilities. That must change. 
This is a make or break moment for the United States of America. And yet, this president, with that shit-eating smirk on his face, smiles and laughs as he threatens everything we care about‚Äîincluding the idea that no one is above the law. 
For Trump to invoke the word 'lynching' to describe his experience‚Äîas the most powerful man on the face of the planet‚Äîreinforces that he has no regard for the history of this country, and that he is very clearly a white supremacist. 
We need to ratify a constitutional amendment banning the president from pardoning anyone tied to an investigation that involves them.The only way we can hold Donald Trump fully accountable for his crimes is if those around him know they are not above the law‚Äîand neither is he.
President Trump has separated kids from their families. He's tried to take school lunch away from hundreds of thousands. And now, we've learned 1 million kids no longer have Medicaid in part because of his policies. This isn't only an attack on them. It's an attack on our future. 
Thanks to this amazing team, Beto has never had to worry about whether or not he‚Äôd make a debate before. But we‚Äôll be honest, we‚Äôre getting a bit worried about making the November stage. Can you chip in to help us advertise and organize so we can qualify?
Beto‚Äôs campaign has 235k donors, well beyond the 165k required to participate in November‚Äôs debate. We have more grassroots enthusiasm than some of the candidates who have already qualified. But we need your help to rise in the polls and make the next debate. Can you chip in?

 This bill is unconstitutional, it's wrong. And it's on all of us to stand up to these attacks on reproductive freedom.
The legacy of slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and suppression is alive and well in every part of this country‚Äîincluding in the White House where the president is a white supremacist. 
Donald Trump has broken the law and is working in the best interests of Russia, defying the best interests of the United States. 
Our kids shouldn't have to endure active shooter drills as a normal part of their lives.We cannot be complacent. We need to listen to our children, and follow the lead of those students marching for our lives to end this epidemic. 
Yep, you got it right. You can't just not be racist. You have to be anti-racist. 
A police officer killed Tay Jefferson as she was playing with her 8 year-old nephew in her own home‚Äîonly miles from where Botham Jean was killed in his own home. Systemic, foundational, endemic racism is alive and well in this country; and it's on us to end it. 
Mayor-elect is one of the most thoughtful, courageous leaders I‚Äôve met in my travels. He‚Äôs going to do great things for Montgomery and great things for America. It was an honor to meet him today. 
Red flag laws save lives. Congress needs to act. 
If we know our county‚Äôs true history then, I believe, we can take the necessary steps to repair the damage done and stop visiting these injustices on the generations that follow ours. 
In detention centers and in prisons, in big cities and small towns, women across America don‚Äôt have access to the period products they need. On  men need to join women in demanding real change‚Äîwhich is why I‚Äôm supporting the Menstrual Equity Act.

On average, 52 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner each month. Women‚Äôs experiences of gun violence are inextricably linked to domestic abuse. That‚Äôs why we must close the Boyfriend Loophole and prevent stalkers and abusers from having easy access to guns. 
Trump, who passed a tax cut for billionaires, wants to make half a million kids go hungry every day at school. The cruelty knows no bounds.

The Constitution clearly bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign powers. Congress must use its authority to enforce the Emoluments Clause now to stop President Trump from profiting off of the G-7 Summit by hosting it at his own property.

The question isn‚Äôt whether President Trump has violated the emoluments clause‚Äîor committed other high crimes. The question is whether Republicans in Congress believe our president is above the law. 
Teachers are heroes, and they deserve to be treated like our future depends on them‚Äîbecause it does. I stand with all who are striking today. 
This president has trafficked in hate and racism. He has tried to make people afraid of our differences. But tonight, Texans are going to come together and we are going to stand up to all of that. Join us at 6:00 in the Theatre at Grand Prairie:  
We lost one of our best. A son of sharecroppers, who went on to represent one of our greatest cities; a fighter for justice, who always led with love‚ÄîRep. Elijah Cummings was everything right about America. He is already missed, but his legacy will be with us forever.
If you‚Äôre in Dallas, and want to stand up to his hatred and bigotry, be a part of our Rally Against Fear tomorrow night. We will show President Trump he doesn‚Äôt represent Texas‚Äîand he doesn‚Äôt represent America.   
We need to stand up to politicians who lead by following polls‚Äîregardless of party. We need to buy back every single AR-15 and AK-47. 
The problem isn't the letter. The problem is the man who wrote it has control of our nuclear weapons, our armed forces, and our treasury. Every day he is president, we are all in danger.
I really still can't understand how brags about contributing to a gun violence epidemic that kills 40,000 Americans every year. 
First, he left our allies to die. Now he‚Äôs challenging their honor. He is a disgrace to everything we stand for as a nation.

Hope to see you tomorrow night at the Theatre in Grand Prairie as we stand up for this country and stand up against Donald Trump's hatred, racism, and intolerance. Join us at the Rally Against Fear:  
If you think buybacks are "symbolic," say that to anyone who lost somebody in Midland Odessa or Sutherland Springs or El Paso. Let's not be fearful. Let's not be governed by the polls. Let's do what's right. 
Freedom is being able to go to school without being afraid of getting shot. 
I don't question Pete's courage‚Äîbut I do question his political courage. Courage in the political arena is doing the right thing, regardless of the polling. 
This is her. Her name is Gina. Her daughter's name is Summer. The problem with our economy is she has to live in her car‚Äîwhile a disgraced TV host like you makes millions.  
I've always tried to bring people all people into to the solutions that we have to our common challenges‚Äîregardless of our difference. That's how we will defeat Donald Trump in 2020 and bring our country together in 2021. 
On social media platforms, people have become the product. We need to hold them accountable for abusing the public trust. 
Facebook should be treated like a publisher. They should not be able to spread lies on their platform.
Imagine if instead of prescribing our veterans opioids, we could prescribe them marijuana, because we made it legal in our country. Let's hold drug companies responsible for the opioid crisis‚Äîand end the war on drugs. 

Legalize marijuana.
This isn't my proposal. This is the proposal of survivors of gun violence. Let's listen to the moms demanding action and the students marching for our lives, instead of the polls and the NRA. Let's buy back every single assault weapon. 
If you think AR-15s are too dangerous to sell, then they're too dangerous to own. We cannot leave 16 million of them in our communities. We need to buy them back.
We need to stand up to Russia and stand with our allies‚Äîincluding Kurds who sacrificed so much for our country, before President Trump abandoned them.
Americans with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and to get by in this country. We need to be there for them.
Americans don't want a handout. They want a shot. They want to be able to join a union. They want to be able to send their kids to a good school. They want a guarantee that if they work hard, they can find success in our country.
We don‚Äôt have to choose between leaving millions uninsured and eliminating private insurance entirely. There's a better way: Medicare For America.

We have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president's criminality. If we do not hold him to account, we have not only failed our constitution, but everyone who has put their lives on the line for our country. He needs to be impeached.
Let's remind our country who we are at our best. 
Innocent people don‚Äôt ignore subpoenas. 
Every single American is at risk because of our failure to act on gun violence‚Äîincluding puertorrique√±os.  Sending love to the families of all of the victims. Together, we will end this epidemic.

Two years ago, millions shared a hashtag, as part of a movement that changed our country. On  2nd anniversary, let's honor the bravery of those women by resolving to build a future where men are held accountable for sexual assault and violence.
He killed Atatiana in her own home while she was playing with her nephew. He needed to be arrested. Now he needs to be held accountable. 
The Americas weren't discovered in 1492. This land belonged to indigenous peoples‚Äîwho were, and continue to be, responsible for so much of its greatness. On Indigenous Peoples' Day, let‚Äôs recognize this past and resolve to do better by them today.
From someone who knows: 
Pete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a ‚Äúshiny object.‚Äù He can say whatever he wants, but  guns kill 40,000 people each year.  Those people deserve action.  I‚Äôll be fighting for them. 
The way you practice your faith within your place of worship is your business. But when you are providing services in the public sphere‚Äîand you deny equal treatment under the law based on someone's skin color or sexual orientation‚Äîthen we have a problem. 
At a conference of Trump supporters, they played a video of our president murdering journalists in a church. Last year, a Trump supporter sent bombs to CNN‚Äîand a shooter entered a church yesterday. This video isn‚Äôt funny. It will get people killed. 
Texans are going to come together Thursday night to stand up for this country and to stand up against this president's hatred, racism, fear, and intolerance. Join us:  
"We defeated ISIS." ‚Äî Donald Trump 
Atatiana Jefferson was killed in her own bedroom by a police officer while she was playing with her nephew. As we mourn with Atatiana's loved ones, we must demand accountability and promise to fight until no family has to face a tragedy like this again. 
This from a man who‚Äôs used his office to stoke hate, fear, and discrimination. Who tried to ban Muslims. Anyone can believe what they want ‚Äîbut organizations that discriminate when they provide public services should not be tax-exempt.
Trump left our allies to die‚Äîplain and simple. He's reckless, he's dishonest, and he's dangerous. Not only are the Kurds less safe because of his presidency, but so are we. 
When gun violence strikes a community, trauma surgeons see the impact up close‚Äîand do everything in their power to save lives. I asked them why weapons like AR-15s kill so efficiently and effectively. Their answers should shock our conscience. 
We have a path to the nomination, but that‚Äôs not a guarantee. Far from it. It‚Äôs going to be very, very difficult‚Äîbut to win, the most important resource we need is you.Join us and read our plan to win: 
 Live Staff Meeting 
 Tune in live for our update‚Äîon how we did last quarter and how we'll get on the path to winning it all this quarter: 
I hope to see you at our team meeting at 5pm MT/7pm ET. We won't only talk about these numbers, but also our plan to win this thing. Join us! 
Thank you for fueling our campaign‚Äîwhich always has been, and always will be, powered by people. Because of you, I believe we will win the Democratic nomination, defeat President Trump in 2020, and bring our country together in 2021.
We did this while not fundraising during the period around the El Paso shooting‚Å†‚Äîbecause that tragedy wasn't about our campaign, it was about our community. And we've raised over a million dollars this quarter for causes like the El Paso Memorial Fund and down ballot candidates.
Our average contribution was $26‚Äîand 99% of our donations were below $200. They came from all 50 states, and 17% of our donors gave to us for the first time this quarter. 
This quarter, we raised $4.5 million‚Äîa million more dollars than last quarter‚Äîand we did it because of people like you. 
We need to get off our back foot on immigration and legalize America. There are millions of people here, many of whom working the toughest jobs in this country, who deserve a path to citizenship. Let's ensure they can contribute to their full potential. 
Last night, Trump bragged about lowering the number of refugees we welcome into the United States. Next week, he'll be bringing this same message of hate to Dallas‚Äîbut at our Rally Against Fear, we will show he doesn't represent our country. Join us:  
Housing is a basic human right. And yet, every night, more than half a million Americans go to sleep without a home. And 50 years after the Fair Housing Act, America‚Äôs neighborhoods remain highly segregated. Here's our plan to fix housing in America: 
In El Paso, we offered health benefits to same-sex partners in 2009‚Äînot only for them, but for any child wondering if those in positions of power thought they had value. Let's start doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do and allow the politics to catch up. 
Blossom, thank you for making your voice heard tonight. We will hold a town hall focused on trans women of color. And I hope you‚Äôll be there. 
There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution or organization in America that denies the full human rights, and the full civil rights, of everyone in America.
The ability of PACs, corporations, and special interests to buy the outcomes they want in elections runs the risk of fundamentally ending this democracy as we know it. We must overturn Citizens United and return power to people before it's too late.
"Foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government." ‚Äî¬†George Washington, Farewell Address 
The children who lose their lives are not the only victims of school shootings. Their classmates, their peers, their friends live with the trauma for the rest of their lives. And if we don‚Äôt act, we will have this on our consciences for the rest of ours. 
Mental health challenges‚Äîfrom depression to PTSD‚Äîshould be treated and recognized with the same care and attention as physical health, despite their frequent invisibility.This should be at the forefront of our minds, not just on World Mental Health Day, but every day.
Together, we will demonstrate that Trump's hatred, racism, division, harmful rhetoric, lawlessness, and corruption have no place in north Texas, in our state, or in this country. Join us Thursday:  
Earlier this year, I released a plan to secure the rights of all LGBTQ+ Americans‚Äîso everyone can live to their full potential no matter who they are or who they love. Tune in to equality town hall tonight on CNN and read the full plan here: 
The NBA's suppression of free speech isn't only disgraceful, it's also un-American. I hope players, coaches, and executives speak out against the league's insistence on prioritizing profits over human rights. 
Trump is holding a rally in Dallas‚Äîand it's on us to declare his hatred, racism, and division does not belong in Texas. That's why we're organizing the Rally Against Fear. If you are ready to stand against Trump, and for our country, join us next Thursday:  
This is the consequence of our inaction. We must treat climate change as the existential threat that it is before it is too late.To those affected: please follow the guidance of local officials, check on your neighbors, and stay safe.

Trump will be responsible for these deaths. 
It‚Äôs long past time that we level the playing field and fully address the inequities women still face in America today. Here's our plan: 
More than 150 years after Montgomery was the capital of the Confederacy; more than 60 years after their bus boycott, Montgomery has elected Steven Reed as its first African American Mayor.A reminder of the progress we can make when we never stop fighting for it. 
Amy and I are wishing an easy fast to all those observing Yom Kippur this evening‚Äîgmar chatimah tovah.
The President‚Äôs letter shows he believes he‚Äôs above the law. It‚Äôs on Congress to prove him wrong. 
The same administration that tried to cut food stamps to save money wants to make it easier for companies to avoid paying taxes by hiding their profits offshore. That tells you all you need to know about their priorities. 
The NRA connected Russian officials with GOP leaders, lied about their executives‚Äô travels to Russia, and its officials pursued personal business interests on NRA-sponsored trips to Russia. If you agree it‚Äôs time the corrupt NRA lose its tax-exempt status, sign on.

No person should be fired for who they are or who they love. Proud to be fighting for LGBTQ+ equality with those at the Supreme Court today and Americans across this country every single day. 
(He won't let him testify because he knows he's guilty.) 
The War in Afghanistan began 18 years ago. That means 18 year-olds are enlisting today who weren‚Äôt alive when the first soldiers deployed. For all who fought for us then, and for all who are fighting for us today, we must end our forever wars.
No one should be denied health care for having a disability. I support Medicare For America, which ensures people with disabilities can access home ; community based long term services ; supports, durable medical equipment, and expanded mental health care. 
We must do better for those living with disabilities in America.We must fully fund our special education programs.We must expand the Voting Rights Act to make it easier to cast their ballots.For too long, we have overlooked people with disabilities. That must change. 
Add your name to demand Mitch McConnell hold a vote to end our epidemic of gun violence. 
Dick's Sporting Goods is doing more to keep Americans safe from assault weapons than Congress. 
The Kurds risked everything to help us combat ISIS‚Äîand now, we are abandoning them, leaving space for a resurgence by the Islamic State. This is not the way to end wars. Trump's approach of abandoning our allies will kill an untold number of Kurds; and make our country less safe. 
The only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment. 
 Sorry we didn‚Äôt get a chance to see you. Heading back to Texas now but I‚Äôll definitely be back. A lot to discuss...
A woman told me undocumented immigrants are a "slap in the face" to "legal immigrants."I told her it's a slap in the face to lock kids in cages.Immigrants pose no threat to her. And we need to call people out for saying they do. 
Thank you, Alayna, for stepping up during our Weekend of Action. Sign up to help Alayna end this epidemic:  
Photoline in Phoenix! 
This is a strong call to conscience from and a reminder that, whatever the polling right now, we will all face the judgment of history. We know Trump has committed impeachable offenses. The question now is what Republican members of Congress are gonna do about it. 
Not again. I visited Kansas City in August‚Äîand everyone I met was warm, generous, and welcoming. My heart is with all who are impacted by this tragedy. Together, communities like ours, which have been victims of gun violence, will lead the way in ending this epidemic. 
There will never be justice, but there must be an investigation to find the truth‚Äîand hold his murderer accountable.
When Botham Jean was killed in his own home, his neighbor, Joshua Brown, spoke out and ensured his murderer was held accountable. His death, like Botham‚Äôs, was a tragedy‚Äîonly possible because we have failed to end this epidemic of gun violence. Sending love to his family. 
When the choice is between corporations and people, corporations and dignity, I stand with workers‚Äîall workers‚Äîeverywhere, every single time. 
In the wealthiest country in the world, no one should be homeless. Heartbroken for all who lost their lives last night; and for all who loved them. 
On our gun violence prevention Weekend of Action, follow the lead of the students marching for our lives‚Äîand add your name to support the Peace Plan:  
Los Angeles, come see us tomorrow. Casa Del Mexicano. 12:30 p.m. Don't care what party you belong to, what you look like, where you're from. Everyone is welcome. I hope to see you there. 
Imagine if he treated immigrants of color with this much generosity. 
They blame movies. They blame video games. They blame candidates like me. All countries have movies, video games, and politicians. The reason Americans are afraid to go to the movies is because we‚Äôre the only country in the world with more guns than people. 
This weekend, we‚Äôre organizing hundreds of events around the country to declare: Hell yes, we are going to end this epidemic of gun violence. Sign up to join us: 
This case has proven it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a U.S. citizen; if you are Latinx, the Trump administration sees you as suspect in our country. This is unconstitutional, it‚Äôs cruel, and it‚Äôs racist. 
This law is not only unconstitutional‚Äîit's an attack on women, especially women of color, across America. But we can‚Äôt rely on justices like Kavanaugh to do the right thing. That‚Äôs why Congress needs to affirm Roe: so no one‚Äôs right to an abortion is determined by their zip code. 
Our president believes he‚Äôs above the law. It‚Äôs time to prove him wrong. 
Nothing about committing crimes in public makes them any less criminal. 
Our plan, Medicare for America, is the best way to bring costs down, guarantee high-quality health care to everyone, and maintain choice. Here's how it works:  
Trump's spent his first term trying to repeal protections for pre-existing conditions‚Äî; he's promised to slash funding for Medicare, Medicaid ; Social Security in his second term. Don‚Äôt fall for this stunt. He wants fewer people to have health care; we want all Americans covered. 
Make no mistake: This is a threat. It‚Äôs an abuse of power. And it‚Äôs an impeachable offense. 
Saw some of my heroes today. 
How could you call mandatory buybacks a ‚Äúshiny object‚Äù in front of March For Our Lives? 
Unions are the engine of our economy‚Äîand a pathway to the middle-class for millions of Americans.I‚Äôm proud to support and employees at Rockingham County Rehabilitation and Nursing Center as they fight for a union. 
Nobody understands the consequences of gun violence more than no one has done more to end this epidemic. Thank you for bringing everyone together today. 
I was asked a question by today‚Äîand I have to say: I'm so moved by the moral compass the young people marching for our lives have been so bravely displaying for all of us.Because of them, we will bring about the change we need to end this epidemic of gun violence. 
To those in our party worried about polls and listening to consultants‚Äîand I‚Äôm thinking about Mayor Pete‚Äîlet me tell you that assault weapons buybacks are supported by a majority of Americans. Not only is this the right thing to do, the American people are with us on this. 
One year ago, Jamal Khashoggi was killed‚Äîa murder the CIA says was directed by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince.Trump still refuses to condemn Mohammed bin Salman. So it's on us to say that we will never forget what they did; and that the next president will hold them accountable.
Wishing a full and speedy recovery. Our thoughts are with you and your family today‚Äîand I look forward to seeing you back out on the campaign trail soon. 
Just left the hospital where I visited Memo‚Äîa victim of the El Paso shooting recovering from his 21st surgery.This view of immigrants as less than human is what killed 22 in El Paso, locked kids in cages ; let 7 kids die as a result of our custody.The cruelty knows no bounds. 
 We built a boat.We camped out.We yelled ‚ÄúHELL YES.‚ÄùWatch our Steak Fry documentary and see how it all came together.
Donate to the ACLU: Register to vote:  
Two years ago, 58 people lost their lives in the deadliest mass shooting in our country‚Äôs history.We will never forget the lives lost in Las Vegas‚Äîand we will never stop fighting to end this epidemic, which takes the lives of nearly 40,000 Americans every year.
Botham‚Äôs family, his friends, his community will never see him again‚Äîso there is no justice. But, at least, there is accountability. 
Donald Trump is a thug, who's acting like a mob boss. He needs to resign. 
The language President Trump is using about treason and a Civil War is what inspires violence in this country. Republicans in the Senate: Do the right thing for this country while there is still time.

Add your name if you think impeachment proceedings should begin today: 
Our president is threatening a Civil War. This is a constitutional crisis, but it's more than that: It's a threat of violence. In El Paso, we saw the consequences of the president's words. I call on Republicans to hold him accountable before more are harmed in his name.

President Trump shouldn‚Äôt wait for Congress to vote. Like President Nixon before him, he should resign. 
Last debate, we went 3 hours without a single question on women's rights. At I was asked about everything from reproductive care to the disparities faced by black women in our criminal justice system. The moderators at the next debate should follow their lead.
While in Congress, my proposal to protect 7,000 acres of wilderness was signed into law as Trump desperately tried to shrink environmental protections. On Public Lands Day ; every day that follows, I‚Äôll never stop fighting for clean air, safe drinking water, and our environment.
Taking questions at a roundtable in Austin  
Our president is a white supremacist‚Äîand white supremacists, across our country, believe his words justify violence against people of color. Trump is unfit for office not only because of the crimes he's committed, but because of the crimes committed in his name every day. 
Campaigns are really upping the ante for End of Quarter fundraising. I could do a Facebook Live with a kitten and say, "We don't want anything to happen to Miss Whiskers so send your $5." I'm not gonna do that, but if you want to donate, here's a link:  
When he calls 6 members of Congress‚Äîall women of color or Jewish‚Äî‚Äúsavages,‚Äù he wants you to think of them as less than human. Like when he calls immigrants an ‚Äúinfestation‚Äù and says "no human being" would want to live in Baltimore. We can‚Äôt be surprised when violence follows. 
 "I have an almost one-year-old son. And I don't ever wanna have to look him in the eye and tell him that we didn't do enough‚Ä¶
Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal, who devoted his life to public service, was killed today in the line of duty. My heart is with his family, with my friend Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, with his fellow officers in Harris County and across the country who are keeping our communities safe tonight. 
Trump‚Äôs ad about Joe Biden is a disgrace. Every one of us needs to call this exactly what it is: propaganda.¬†Doing anything less is playing right into his hands.
Botham Jean was shot and killed by a police officer in his own apartment. Today, his murderer is on trial‚Äîand she needs to be held accountable. Because we cannot let white police officers continue to kill unarmed black men with impunity in this country. 
Add your name if you think the NRA should have to pay taxes. 
When Jason‚Äôs voice is being heard, we‚Äòre all better off. So glad he, and this veteran, received the care they need.Too many in our country never have that chance‚Äîand it‚Äôs on us to ensure everyone who‚Äôs served our country has everything they need to thrive when they return home. 
The NRA should lose its tax-exempt status.
Republicans in Congress work for the NRA‚Äîand now, we know the NRA works for Russia. We need to defeat them and end this crisis. 
A year ago, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford told her story. Senators didn‚Äôt listen, but the Americans people did. Like Anita Hill before her, the impact of her testimony will inspire and encourage women to continue to have the courage to speak out. She is a hero.

The President of the United States is threatening to harm a public servant for exposing his abuse of power.If you don‚Äôt see why he should be impeached, you‚Äôre not looking. 
Yesterday, people brought assault weapons to our rally at Kent State‚Äîwhere 4 students were shot dead in 1970.I told them nobody should show up with an AK-47 or an AR-15 to seek to intimidate us in our own democracy.We need to buy back every single one of them. 
We need a Department of Education that is focused on public education. Let's replace Betsy DeVos and not allow our tax dollars to be taken out of our classrooms, sent away from our heroic public school educators, and given to private schools.

It‚Äôs not dead because of impeachment and it wasn‚Äôt dead last week when they claimed it was because of buybacks. It‚Äôs dead because Trump and McConnell are afraid of the NRA. 
 FINAL UPDATE: Due to tremendous support, Beto will be speaking in Risman plaza at 6:30 PM! Be there! 
UPDATE: Our Kent State Town Hall is now in front of the Student Center. See you soon! 
I‚Äôm so inspired by the UPMC workers I met today‚Äîwho aren't just fighting for themselves, but for workers everywhere. They have a right to a $15 minimum wage, they have a right to make ends meet, and they have a right to join a union. I am with them. 
Visiting with striking GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio. 
One of the safest cities in America "looked like a war zone" because a civilian owned a weapon of war. We need to buy back every single AR-15 and AK-47‚Äîand we can't let fear of the NRA stop us from saying so. 
I believe this is one of those moments where people, including Republicans, are going to put their country over their party, the future of this nation over their next election. 
‚ÄúI would like you to do us a favor though‚Äù  
This confirms what we already knew: President Trump asked a foreign power to investigate a political rival. He‚Äôs unfit for office and needs to be impeached. 
This is how we free ourselves from fear:We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it.We don't let anyone tell us what is possible. Because we the people decide what is possible in this country. 
North Carolina A;T students have a long history of political activism. But that has come with a history of voter suppression‚Äîwhich continues to this day. I signed their petition for an early voting site. On National Voter Registration Day, join me: 
Add your name if you agree President Trump is unfit for office and should be impeached: 
We have a lawless president, who has undermined our democracy; a racist president, who has incited violence; a reckless president, who has let our planet burn and fleeced taxpayers for his own benefit. To my former colleagues in Congress: Finish the job and impeach him.
In August of 2017, I was asked if I would vote to impeach Donald Trump. I said yes. I believed then what I believe now: Donald Trump is unfit to be president, he is a threat to our democracy, and he needs to be impeached. 
Ok. Now release the full whistleblower complaint. 
 I just spoke with who implored to pay its workers the wages they deserve. He wants them to end this strik‚Ä¶
LIVE NOW: Gun Violence Town Hall at McKinley United Methodist Church in Dayton, Ohio 
Read our full plan, and register to vote, today:¬†
We‚Äôll return power to people by: ‚úÖEnding gerrymandering and voter suppression‚úÖBanning PAC contributions‚úÖMaking Election Day a federal holiday‚úÖEnacting same day and automatic registration¬†‚úÖPreventing members of congress from becoming lobbyists
Earlier this year, I released a voting rights plan to register 50 million new voters by 2024‚Äîand ensure 35 million new Americans show up to the polls.
That's why we need a New Voting Rights Act. Because the only way we're going to overcome the greatest set of challenges we've ever faced‚Äîfrom climate change to gun violence‚Äîis by fixing our democracy.
This is proof that progress is possible‚Äîwhich is why, on National Voter Registration Day, you should register to vote:¬† But we also need to recognize that it should never have been this hard for TSU students to vote on campus in the first place.
They organized, turned out, and elected Democrats up and down the ballot across the region‚Äîincluding a new County Clerk who, last month, announced that there would finally be an early polling location at TSU.
I find inspiration in the students of Texas Southern University, an HBCU in Texas. In 2018, the Harris County Clerk didn't allow them to have an early voting location‚Äîbut the students refused to give in.
On National Voter Registration Day, let's all make sure that we're registered to vote‚Äîbut let's also recognize how many of our fellow Americans are locked out of our democracy.¬†We can't stop fighting until every voice is heard and every vote is counted.
If we allow the president to get away with the crimes he‚Äôs committed, then we will set the precedent that some people are above the law. And then, this democracy will be lost to us forever. It‚Äôs time for Speaker Pelosi and the House to do their job.
It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it's still true today: President Trump should be impeached.
We needed to protect the 22 killed in El Paso.We need to protect the 100 who will be killed by a gun today.Americans don't want assault weapons on our streets‚Äîincluding in Texas, We deserve a president who will stop this. And in 2020, we will elect one. 
Today I learned about Terrell who loved to play the bass; Archie who‚Äôd just been promoted from apprentice mechanic to parts manager; and Kenneth whose sons were the light of his life. At Purpose Over Pain, I met their mothers‚Äîwhose resolve must inspire all of us to keep fighting. 
Transgender women are targeted, attacked, and murdered in our country with impunity. We must demand accountability. We must demand justice. We must demand an end to this epidemic. 
We don't need the transcripts. The president admitted to asking a foreign power to investigate a political opponent. Impeach him.
You can still be fired, denied a home, barred from adopting a child in America because of who you love. On  we must not only fight to pass The Equality Act, but to ensure equal treatment for every single person in our country.
Yesterday, I met with members of the Meskwaki Nation, who talked to me about the discrimination and violence they face. On  Day, let's commit to closing the pay gap‚Äîand guaranteeing equal pay for all. 
LIVE NOW: Beto Holds Town Hall at J‚Äôs Breakfast Club in Gary, Indiana 
We need to do better‚Äîfor Greta, for the students marching for our lives, and for all of the young people who will inherit our planet from us in worse shape than we found it, unless we act. 
Climate change is the greatest existential threat we face‚Äîand our president thinks it's only worth 10 minutes of his time. 
Together, we can end this epidemic. 
 ‚ÄúI think El Paso reminded me or brought home for me how urgent this situation is out there in the country right now.‚Äù‚Ä¶
It was true when I was on the El Paso City Council and it‚Äôs true today: We must legalize marijuana and end the War on Drugs. 
No fear. 
Assault weapons have been used as instruments of terror to hunt down our fellow human beings across this country.We must buy back every single one.We must get them off our streets, out of our homes, and ensure they are never again used against us. 
Children of color are far more likely to be suspended, expelled, punished in classrooms than white students‚Äîeven in first grade. This is how the school-to-prison pipeline works. And it‚Äôs on us to end it. 
Casey‚Äôs pizza. Breakfast of champions. 
Since my time on the El Paso City Council, I've been advocating for legalizing marijuana. We will never erase the damage done by the War on Drugs‚Äîthe lives lost, the years spent behind bars‚Äîbut we can end the cruelty today and begin to right the wrongs of our past. 
What is Congress waiting for? This is crazy. Unless we take action now, we will see the end of American democracy. 
This is how we free ourselves from fear: We decide what we believe in, we fight like hell to achieve it, and we don't let anyone‚Äîthe NRA, corporations, PACs, or even our fellow Democrats‚Äîtell us what is and isn't possible. We, the people, decide what is possible in our country. 
Since saying "hell yes," I keep being asked if I'm afraid.I'd be afraid if I were a teacher protecting students from AR-15; if I were a trans woman of color; if I had to drive 300 miles for an abortion.But for those living in fear in America, our leaders must be fearless. 
I am so proud to lead this campaign of the best people in America. We‚Äôre gonna knock on every door, make every phone call, have every conversation with everyone‚ÄîDemocrats, Independents, and Republicans alike. Because, before we are anything else, we are all Americans first. 
 Congressman hypes up his supporters before walking into the Iowa Steak Fry: ‚ÄúTo all of you boat building, ov‚Ä¶
Iowa. 
Hello Steak Fry! 
 I love Iowa.   
Joe is right: There is no bottom. Impeach him. 
Eight years ago, President Obama repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell. But with his transgender troop ban, Trump proved we still have a long way to go toward equality.Let's finish the work President Obama started and make sure everyone can serve our country, no matter who they are.
Trump would rather risk the lives of families who are seeking asylum than welcome them here. We need a president who honors our identity as a nation comprised of immigrants from the world over and recognizes they aren't a threat to our country, but the reason we are great. 
A woman in CO told me "hell no" she won't give back her AR-15.I listened, but by her logic: Why shouldn't you be allowed to have a bazooka or a tank?These are the conversations Congress shouldn't be afraid of‚Äîbecause if we're going to end this epidemic, we need to have them. 
In 2016, President Trump asked Russia to interfere in our elections. In 2020, he's asking Ukraine to do the same.If no one is above the law, then we have no choice but to impeach this president.When will Congress have the courage to act? 
Harvey was Houston's third 500-year flood in 3 years. Now, the region is flooding again.Climate change isn't a distant threat, it's already here. Following the lead of students like who I will be striking in solidarity with today, we must do everything to end it.
We have a lawless president, who is a threat to our democracy. He must be impeached.
Had the chance to sit down with We talked about why we need to end this epidemic of gun violence, what it was like to meet President Obama, and why I never made it past 8th grade basketball. Hope you listen.  
We need to end this epidemic. Sending love to D.C.

I was asked about Chuck Schumer‚Äôs criticism of my plan to buy back assault weapons.My response is: What has he been able to get done?The American people are with us on this. They‚Äôre just waiting on Congress to do the right thing. 
I‚Äôm running for president of the United States‚Äîof everyone in the United States. If we really want to understand the story of this country, we need to go everywhere, from Blunts and Moore dispensary to Skid Row to San Quentin State Prison. 
The War on Drugs has always been a War on People. Here's how we'll end it:

Thinking of our friends in Beaumont and the surrounding communities right now as they face serious flooding. Please stay safe and follow the lead of local first responders. We're with you. 
DC should be a state with two Senators and full representation in the House. Every voice deserves to be heard and every vote deserves to be counted in our democracy. 
LIVE NOW: Beto at Cannabis, Equity, and Justice Roundtable 
Donate any amount today to get a copy of my book on legalizing marijuana and ending the War on Drugs. 
 if you agree that it‚Äôs time to legalize marijuana. 
We will never erase the damage done by the drug war‚Äîthe lives lost, the years spent behind bars‚Äîbut we can begin to remedy the injustices of the past by ending the cruelty today. Read our full plan here: 
Let‚Äôs ensure those most impacted by the drug war benefit from the economic opportunities surrounding marijuana‚Äîby making sure they receive a majority of the licenses and waiving licensing fees for low-income people who have been convicted of marijuana offenses.
We will also invest in the communities that have long been most impacted by the War on Drugs‚Äîproviding a ‚ÄúDrug War Justice Grant‚Äù to everyone who was formerly incarcerated for a nonviolent marijuana offense, funded entirely by a tax on the marijuana industry.
Our plan starts with: Legalizing marijuana, providing clemency for those currently serving time, and expunging the records of everyone who has been convicted for possession in the past. But we don‚Äôt stop there.
Today, we are releasing our plan to legalize marijuana and ensure that we repair the injustices of our nation‚Äôs drug policies‚Äîso they aren‚Äôt visited on future generations. Read it here: 
Even as marijuana has been legalized in states across our country, inequities have persisted‚Äîas white communities have benefited from new business opportunities, while communities of color still face over-policing and criminalization.
I believe today what I believed then: We don‚Äôt only need to legalize marijuana. We also need to repair the damage done to communities of color that have been locked up in our criminal justice system, or locked out of opportunity, because of the War on Drugs.
When I was on the El Paso City Council, I started advocating for legalizing marijuana and ending a War on Drugs I had seen become a War on People‚Äîdevastating black and brown communities on both sides of the border. In 2011, I published a book about it: 
The media needs to stop fear-mongering. The only guns you will have to sell back are weapons of war, designed to kill as efficiently and effectively as possible. The American people are with me on this: AR-15s and AK-47s belong on the battlefield, not in our communities. 
Proud every single day to be fighting for LGBTQ+ equality alongside members across the country. Looking forward to the town hall. 
If Congress had made progress already, I might entertain the argument that a buyback is too politically risky. But playing it safe and allowing the NRA to set the terms of the debate no longer works for me, no longer works for our kids, and no longer works for this country. 
No m√°s ni√±os en jaulas.No m√°s muros.No m√°s de esta ret√≥rica que incita ataques hacia los inmigrantes. 
I visited the Downtown Women's Center in Skid Row, where women, especially women of color, who are struggling with homelessness‚Äîin the wealthiest country in the history of the world‚Äîare providing an example to all of us of how to respond to adversity.Please share their story. 
Today, the sent out a petition calling on supporters to "tell Beto no" to a mandatory buyback program. But the doesn't represent the American people‚Äîand today, we can prove it. Sign our petition calling for a buyback of every AR-15:  
The majority of the country supports background checks, licensing, red flag laws, and yes, a mandatory assault weapons buyback. The party is with us, the country is with us.Now it‚Äôs time for Democrats to lead.
Hell yes, we‚Äôre going to buy back every single assault weapon. I‚Äôm ready to get this done. Chip in today to support us:
Yes, we‚Äôre going to buy back every assault weapon. And pass background checks, pass red flag laws, and create a gun licensing program. The only thing stopping Trump from taking action is his own cowardice. Can you donate to help us send that message today?

When kids go back to school, they have plenty to worry about. They shouldn‚Äôt also have to wonder if they‚Äôre going to make it home. We need to buy back all of these assault weapons.Warning: It‚Äôs graphic, but this is an important video from
The Amazon is burning. Farms are underwater. The Bahamas was hit by a historic hurricane. And yet‚Äîas CA fights to end climate change, Trump is doing everything he can to stop them from doing so.His ignorance and malice know no bounds. And our future is at risk because of it. 
To be clear: We will buy back every single assault weapon. We‚Äòll also license every gun ; do a background check on every buyer. That‚Äôs what the American people want‚Äîand deserve. The only thing stopping us from ending this epidemic is you ; your cowardice. Do the right thing. 
Legalizing marijuana isn't enough. We also need to make sure those most impacted by the War on Drugs have a chance to benefit from this growing industry. Thanks to everyone at Equity First Alliance and Cage-Free Cannabis in L.A. for sharing their stories with me today. 
 Tonight, I'm leading 20+ in holding the floor and calling on Mitch McConnell to act on gun violence. More‚Ä¶
The problem with homelessness isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs inconvenient for Donald Trump and his wealthy friends. It‚Äôs that there are people in the same country as Donald Trump and his wealthy friends who are forced to live on the street.
We can end homelessness. But to do so, we need a President who will tackle this problem with the compassion it requires.
This is classic Trump. He‚Äôs going to terrorize homeless  Americans because he thinks they can‚Äôt fight back. They deserve shelter. They deserve affordable housing.  They deserve mental health care. And most of all they deserve dignity.
Ms. Hill wants to be either a chef or cosmetologist, but for now, she‚Äôd like for the government to look at her not like a criminal, but like a human being doing what she can to survive. 
Today, I spent time with people experiencing homelessness in LA ‚Äî people like Ms. Hill. She sleeps next to 49 other women. When she needs privacy, she goes out to one of the tents on Skid Row, where police often harass and arrest people like her.

We need to buy back every single one of these assault weapons.

As President I will not go to war for Saudi Arabia, nor will I let Saudi Arabia dictate our foreign policy.
When candidates say, "At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested," shit, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue‚Äîand we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country. 
Proud to call El Paso home‚Äîa community of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers that represents the best of America.As Hispanic Heritage Month begins, let‚Äôs commit to defending Latinx Americans from the threats they face and celebrating them for making our country great. 
Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh‚Äîone we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination. We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached.
Who the hell cares about Joe Biden's age? You have kids in cages. You have 10 years left to confront climate change. Millions who can't see a doctor. Nearly 40,000 gun deaths a year. A lawless president. We have to talk about the big things people in this country care about. 
Leaving millions of weapons of war on the streets because Trump and McConnell are ‚Äúat least pretending to be open to reforms‚Äù? That calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place. Let‚Äôs have the courage to say what we believe and fight for it. 
I was asked about saying mandatory buybacks are "awful."I said the priorities in D.C. are screwed up.What's awful is a 17 month-old baby shot in the face with an AR-15 in Odessa. What's awful is 22 people killed in a Walmart buying school supplies in El Paso. 
I was asked if it‚Äôs naive to advocate for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. The answer is no. It‚Äôs naive to maintain the status quo, where nearly 40,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence every year. 
In the last senate race, Democrats lost Fort Bend County by 19 points. But in 2018, we won it by 12. We did that by organizing everywhere, knocking on doors, and working with candidates up and down the ticket. Great to be back today to support in her HD28 election.

Transgender women of color have been targeted, attacked, and murdered across America. We know of 18 transgender people killed this year alone. If we don't confront this reality then we can't correct it. Justice must be served for Bee Love Slater. Equality must be secured for all. 
We can't allow the NRA to set the terms of this debate. We can't allow people sending death threats to set the terms of this debate. We should be following the lead of the students marching for our lives, who actually want us to do something about gun violence. 
Last night, I was asked if I‚Äôd buy back AR-15s and AK-47s.I said, ‚ÄúHell yes.‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre with me, . 
This is a good step, but doesn‚Äôt have to wait for Congress to act. They can stop processing credit card payments on assault weapons today. 
Much respect to Sen. Coons for leading the fight on background checks. But the time for letting status quo politics determine how far we can go is over. If we agree that having millions of weapons of war on the streets is a bad idea, we have to do something about it. 
Both parties have deported immigrants who pose no threat to our country.Democrats need to get off the back foot‚Äîand legalize America. Make Dreamers citizens. Make their families citizens. And make sure we have a safe system to come and contribute to this country. 
Texas faced two mass shootings in a month‚Äîand the furthest Governor Abbott will go is ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù background checks. We need background checks on every sale‚Äîno loopholes, no exceptions. We need to buy back every assault weapon. And it‚Äôs on all of us to get it done. 
The very thing that drew that killer to EL Paso is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of the country.We don't see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous. We see them as foundational to our success, our strength, and our security.

8 human beings have lost their lives in our custody this year alone. This is being done in our names. It's on our hands. And in a democracy, where the people are the government and the government is the people, it's on us to make this right and end this cruelty. 
 Welcome to our house 
If enough of us make our voices heard now, we will force banks and credit card companies to act. Add your name to this petition we‚Äôre sending Visa, Mastercard, and the big banks: 
Banks and credit card companies must: 1‚É£Refuse to take part in the sale of assault weapons.2‚É£Stop processing transactions for gun sales online ; at gun shows without background checks.3‚É£Stop doing business with gun ; ammo manufacturers who produce or sell assault weapons
Credit cards have enabled many of America‚Äôs mass shootings in the last decade‚Äîand with Washington unwilling to act, they need to cut off the sales of weapons of war today. 
"I'm not gonna be a millionaire. I just want to be able to do what I love."That's what Tim said when we visited him and the bearing the brunt of an economy that's rigged against them, but they're also working hard as ever. It‚Äôs on us to do right by them. 
Trump's policy on asylum seekers isn't only racist, it's cruel‚Äîpreventing some of the world's most desperate and vulnerable human beings from finding safety. With its decision today, The Supreme Court has put lives in danger.

The reason our country created Temporary Protected Status is for moments like this‚Äîso we can provide a safe harbor to those who need one most. The Trump Administration has stated, again and again, they want our country to become whiter. Thousands are now suffering as a result.
He would have granted it if they were from Norway. 
"It definitely felt like I was in the right place, talking to the right people." That's what Amy wrote after her first solo trip to New Hampshire. So grateful she was out on the trail; and so grateful to everyone who welcomed her to the Granite State. 
In 2018, we put Texas in play for the first time in decades. In 2020, we're going to win it. And the state's 38 electoral votes will ensure that we defeat Trump. Grateful for the more than 100 Texas elected officials and community leaders who have endorsed our campaign. 
Our campaign has always been about going everywhere and talking to everyone‚Äîincluding those whose first language isn't English. That's why we're really excited to launch where we'll continue to have conversations and listen pero en espa√±ol. ¬°S√≠guenos! 
Trump is denying asylum seekers the right to a fair hearing, forcing them to Remain in Mexico, without access to counsel. These tent facilities are an assault on the values of our country‚Äîwhich is, and always will be, a nation of laws; and a nation of immigrants. 
Every year on 9/11, we are called to remember the service and sacrifice of our first responders, who risked everything for their fellow human beings. They, like the heroes in El Paso on August 3rd, ran toward danger. And we will never forget their bravery.
That's 300,000 human beings, who don't know how they'll provide for their families, put food on their tables, make enough to get by. President Trump is responsible for this, and it's on us to hold him accountable. 
Our president has spent years sabotaging The Affordable Care Act at every turn‚Äîand now, we're paying the price. We need a president who will fight to achieve universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care for every single American. 
Women's health care shouldn't be a privilege for the few, but a right for everyone. That includes abortion. South Carolina's bill is unconstitutional, it's wrong, and it's on all of us to call on the State Senate to vote it down. 
Dan is running to flip a seat Republicans have held since 1963‚Äîand today, you can help him do it. If you‚Äôre in North Carolina‚Äôs 9th district, get out and vote to elect Dan and send a message that Democrats aren‚Äôt only coming for safe seats. We‚Äôre coming for all of them.

"Criminals" and "rapists." "Animals" and "bad people."  Trump doesn't see immigrants as humans beings to be welcomed into our country, but as a threat to be kept out.He shouldn't be stoking fear of Bahamians; he should be offering them refuge. And it's on us to demand he does.

No one knows more about the cost of gun violence, and no one is doing more to end this epidemic, than I am with because I refuse to accept this as our fate. Gun violence is a human-created problem, and we can be the humans who end it. 
This is the height of cruelty‚Äîdenying help to those who need it most. This administration has said the words on the Statue of Liberty should be rewritten, and in their actions, they are already changing who we are as a country. It's on us to prove we're better than this. 
Good read.
20 veterans die by suicide every day across America. In Congress, my proposal to expand access to mental health care for veterans was signed into law. But our work isn't done. This is an epidemic‚Äîand as National Suicide Prevention Week begins, we must do everything to end it.

"Doing nothing is not an option." Thank you, Shauna, for your courage‚Äîlast weekend, when the shooter opened fire, and today. We must all come together, Democrats and Republicans, gun-owners and non-owners alike, to end this epidemic. 
A student asked what she should say to family members who support Trump.I said she should tell them what's important to her‚Äîand why‚Äîbecause conversations like these are how our democracy works when it works best. And if there were ever a time to have them, it's now. 
Yesterday, we heard Trump wants to cut the number of refugees in our country. Today, I spent time with Reverend Sandra Pontoh and Indonesian asylum seekers, who are living proof that America will always be a proud nation of immigrants‚Äîno matter who our president is. 
 Happy birthday, Brian! Congratulations on the guitar. Take good care of it.
At its best, America is defined by its aspirations‚Äîand by the resolve of the people who work to see them realized. That leadership will ensure we end the epidemic of gun violence, pass a reparations bill, make health care a right, and rewrite our immigration laws in our image. 
Though America produced the hatred that led to the El Paso shooting, our country also produced the students who sat at the Woolworth‚Äôs counter and the students marching for their lives‚Äîand all of ours‚Äîtoday. In NH, I shared my belief that they'll be the ones to define who we are.

I was asked if I‚Äôd go on Fox News. The answer is I would, but not without holding them accountable for trafficking in the kinds of lies and hysteria and bigotry and fear and racism that produces violence, hate, and paranoia in this country‚Äîas it did in El Paso last month.

Two years ago, Trump tried to roll back DACA‚Äîbecause he wanted to deport Dreamers from their home country. Let's be clear: Dreamers are Americans. They make our country stronger. And it's long past time for us to sign the DREAM Act into law, so they can become citizens.

We should price carbon‚Äîand I think the best possible path to do that is a cap-and-trade system, which holds polluters accountable and provides dividends to the communities most affected by climate change. 
We need to honor our best traditions as a country of immigrants‚Äîand allow those impacted by climate change to apply for asylum in our country. It's the right thing to do, it's just, and those we welcome to our country will make us stronger, more successful, and more secure. 
 Puerto Ricans are Americans. It's our duty to protect them from the escalating natural disasters caused by climate change.‚Ä¶
I know Americans are up to the challenge, because I‚Äôve been listening to Americans all around this country. We just need leadership that reflects that ambition‚Äîand the hard work, commitment, and ingenuity we will bring to get it done.

The wealthiest countries have produced the majority of the climate change we‚Äôve seen that is disproportionately impacting low-income countries‚Äîcountries like the Bahamas. Let‚Äôs offer Temporary Protected Status to everyone there who wants to seek refuge in our country.
Solving climate change is not inexpensive‚Äîbut what is far more expensive is failing to do so. 
 Communities of color suffer the consequences of pollution and climate change. As president, I'll invest $1.2 trillion in those most harmed by our environment‚Äîso they can not only combat the worst consequences of climate change, but lead our clean energy future.
The will receive the credit for the change we see. They have forced those in power, and those in public trust, to solve these challenges. The United States, the indispensable country, will meet this moment‚Äîand it will be because of them. 
We don‚Äôt get a second chance at solving climate change. This is America, and we are up to this challenge.

President Trump is diverting $3.6 billion from our military‚Äîincluding $20 million from Fort Bliss in El Paso‚Äîto pay for his wall. Our service members keep us safe. His wall is useless. Our safety is the price of Trump's racism. And we're all paying for it.

The stakes are clear. We are running out of time to act. We have to do everything we can to overcome this challenge and we have to do it now. Here's what I'll do as president: 
Climate change is the greatest threat we face‚Äîand we have one last chance to meet this moment before it's too late. That's why we were the first campaign to release a plan: 
This confirms what we already knew: The children separated from their families, locked in cages, forced to sleep on concrete floors under tinfoil blankets, will live with this trauma for the rest of their lives. We'll have it on our consciences for the rest of ours.

When Puerto Rico seemed like it might be in the path of Hurricane Dorian, instead of promising to protect his constituents, President Trump called Puerto Rico ‚Äúone of the most corrupt places on earth‚Äù‚Äîand complained about ‚Äúyet another‚Äù hurricane heading their way.
A year after Hurricane Maria, many homes in Puerto Rico still hadn‚Äôt been rebuilt‚Äîand many puertorrique√±os were left without basic necessities. Many still haven‚Äôt recovered.
When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, President Trump‚Äôs abysmal response contributed to the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives as a result of the storm. Trump, meanwhile, called his efforts ‚Äúone of the best jobs that‚Äôs ever been done.‚Äù
This week, with storms on the horizon, President Trump moved more than $150 million from FEMA to ICE. Think about that: He has prioritized locking children in cages over helping communities recover from hurricanes.
With Hurricane Dorian headed toward our shores, let‚Äôs send love to all who may be impacted‚Äîand also acknowledge we have a President who has proven incapable of responding to these storms. This is his record:
Pads.Showers.Toothbrushes.Soap.They will not treat immigrants with basic human dignity‚Äîbecause they do not see them as human. 
The road to 2020 runs through 2019. The road to America runs through the Commonwealth of Virginia. Thank you, Virginia Tech, for inspiring me‚Äîand serving as an example for our country. 
See you soon. 
At our town hall in Roanoke, I met Sarah, who told me that she was a student at Virginia Tech when the shooting took place. We discussed how communities across America that have borne the brunt of this epidemic are leading the way in ending it. We are all in this fight together. 
Hello, Roanoke! 
 Bland County, V.A. - (WVVA) For the first time ever, a presidential candidate visited Bland, Virginia. WVVA's Jennifer Roberts wa‚Ä¶
The challenges we face will not be solved with half the country. That's why we refuse to write anyone off, including the people of Bland, Virginia, a county where Trump won 82% of the vote; a county no presidential candidate had ever visited‚Äîuntil today. 
Can‚Äôt wait! 
In TX, you can fire someone or stop them from adopting a child because they're LGBTQ. You can even kill someone for coming onto you‚Äîand then use their sexual orientation as a legal defense. We need to pass the Equality Act so LGBTQ Americans have their full rights in every state. 
People are going to die. 
As the school year starts, kids should be thinking about their classes‚Äîand Friday night's game‚Äînot whether ICE is going to raid their community and separate them from their families.
Big thanks to North Carolina A;T State University for welcoming me to campus this afternoon. So inspired by the students I met‚Äîwho are leaders in the classroom and in their communities. 
 News is rolling out a comprehensive new trade agenda today. I've got it here.Key: Beto would end Trump'‚Ä¶
This plan is for workers‚Äîall workers, from El Paso, TX to  Lordstown, OH to Pacific Junction, IA. We will ensure they are not only protected, but are the most competitive workers in the world. Read the full plan here: 
The plan includes four key components:1‚É£Ending Trump‚Äôs disastrous trade war2‚É£Pursuing trade agreements that support working families3‚É£Enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. workers and our small businesses4‚É£Defending American values and interests against competitors like China
I just released Trade For America, a sweeping plan to immediately end President Trump‚Äôs reckless trade wars and pursue an aggressive trade strategy that puts the needs of American workers and families over corporate profits and interests. Read it here: 
In the face of what looked to be an intractable problem, Richmond, McCain, Blair, and McNeil stood up for civil rights by sitting at a Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro. With their courage as an inspiration, we can finish the work they started in achieving equality for all. 
When Fox News and our president claim immigrants are invading our country, we can't be surprised when white supremacists take up arms. We need to connect the dots. 
With the Amazon burning, farms under water, and hurricanes looming, Trump has decided to lift regulations on methane‚Äîone of the most dangerous greenhouse gasses. Even oil and gas companies think this is too far. We need a President who will act on climate, not make it worse. 
 Dr. Lydia Holm, a Pediatric ER doctor in Des Moines, knows has a plan to solve the gun violence epidemic in thi‚Ä¶
Like El Paso, Charlotte recently bore the brunt of gun violence‚Äîand is providing an example to the rest of the country of how to respond to this epidemic. Following the lead of young people like Cade, and moms demanding action across our country, I know we'll end this crisis. 
Thank you, for always fighting for what's right. Every day of this campaign, your leadership brought attention to the issues that matter most‚Äîand our party, and our country, are stronger because of it.
This is how President Trump honors the bravery and sacrifice of our service members. 
We can't become numb to these stories: Trump has promised to pardon government workers who break the law to build a wall we don't need. This is the consequence of failing to impeach him: He believes he's above the law‚Äîand he'll keep acting like it, until we hold him accountable. 
On this day in 1955, Emmett Till was murdered. Exactly 8 years later, Dr. King shared his dream for America. The hatred, racism, white supremacy that led to Emmett's lynching is still alive. But on this anniversary, let's once again dare to dream of‚Äîand fight for‚Äîa better future.
Thank you to Representative Williams and all of the pastors who shared a meal with me in the Pee Dee this morning. Grateful for the opportunity to discuss gun violence, affordable housing, and how we can repair the damage Trump has done to our country‚Äîtogether. 
Today, a man asked me how I know Trump is a racist. I'm glad he came to our rally‚Äîbecause I was able to tell him about:-"Send them back"-Birtherism-"Shithole countries"-Charlottesville-Calling immigrants "animals" and "predators"-And much more... 
For context: Today, Trump said he would transfer $155 million from FEMA's efforts at disaster relief to ICE. We have a president who would rather spend money caging kids than helping Puerto Rico‚Äîand it's on us to demand a new one. 
Town hall at Seminar Brewing Company in Florence, South Carolina 
From town halls at Voorhees College and S.C. State University to Benedict College, I've been impressed by the determination on HBCU campuses across the state. The students I met are not the leaders of tomorrow but the leaders of right now‚Äîon every issue. Grateful for the welcome. 
Dreamers are Americans‚Äîand our country is stronger, safer, and better because they call it home. I hope the Supreme Court makes the right decision, but the only way to protect Dreamers is to defeat President Trump and make them citizens. 
 Crowd flowing out the door for at Benedict College in Columbia.  
‚ÄúNo decisions about us without us.‚Äù Black women are the heart and soul of the Democratic Party‚Äîand they must be at the table. I'm truly inspired by Kayla Mallet, Dr. Roslyn Clark Artis, and everyone who joined me at today's  roundtable at Benedict College. 
From Martin Luther King Jr. to Esau Jenkins, The Progressive Club has welcomed some of the most important civil rights leaders in our nation's history. Thank you to Abe, Esau's grandson, for the reminder of how much progress we've made‚Äîand how much more work we have to do. 
No matter how you ask the question, my answer will be the same: The decision of whether or not to get an abortion is one neither I nor the United States government should be making. That's a decision for the woman to make. 
Ismail flew into Boston to start his freshman year at Harvard‚Äîbut when he arrived, he was deported after facing questions about his religion. They don't care if you're seeking asylum or coming to attend college; if you're an immigrant, they will treat you as less than human.

Eddie Hill IV, 10 years-old. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unimaginable,‚Äù his mother says. But it continues to happen across our country.
Jurnee Thompson, 8 years-old. She was at a football game with her family when she was killed. ‚ÄúThe little girl wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong,‚Äù said Police Chief John Hayden.
Xavier Usanga, 7 years-old. The next day would have been Xavier‚Äôs first day of second grade. Xavier‚Äôs sister was also shot that day. Their mother, Dawn, said to the shooter: ‚ÄúYou killed my son... and I hope his smile will burn in your brain forever.‚Äù
Kennedi Powell, 3 years-old.  ‚ÄúShe was a beautiful young lady. She was the type of person who liked to play a lot, like to run off and pinch you,‚Äù her grandmother said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard‚Äîreal hard.‚Äù
Kayden Johnson, 2 years-old. Think about that. 2 years-old.  ‚ÄúHe was uplifting,‚Äù Kayden‚Äôs father said. ‚ÄúHe was always smiling.‚Äù
Since April, at least 12 kids in St. Louis have lost their lives to guns. Kayden. Kennedi. Xavier. Jurnee. Eddie. Charnija. Derrel. Sentonio. Myiesha. Jashon. Kristina. Jason. Here's a bit about who they were.
Every year, nearly 40,000 human beings lose their lives to gun violence. That number is so incomprehensibly large‚Äîso tragic‚Äîwe lose sight of the individual lives lost. So tonight, I want to focus on one city, where an 8 year-old and a 15 year-old were shot dead this weekend. 
Great to be back in Charleston, South Carolina. 
About damn time. We can't accept living in a country where Americans are in jail for possessing marijuana‚Äîbut not a single Pharma exec has spent even a night behind bars for the opioid crisis. The least they can do is pay up. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to spend time with in Kansas City‚Äîwhere I learned about how he's helping eradicate homelessness. Jason may not be in elected office, but he is the definition of a public servant. And I am so lucky to call him a friend. 
In Helsinki, President Trump sided with Vladimir Putin over our intelligence services. Today, he sided with Putin over President Obama. This isn't complicated: We need a president who sides with America over Russia. 
On  let's celebrate the progress women have made in America‚Äîbut also recognize how much work we need to do to realize true equality. That isn't only on women; all of us, especially men, need to help our country live up to its promise of equality for all.
For as long as he is president, they will continue to separate children from their parents. This is being done in our name, it is on all of our consciences, and it is up to us to prove we are better than this. 
Vladimir Putin led a coordinated attack on our democracy‚Äîand President Trump's response is to invite him back into G7. Once again, Trump is providing Putin with a green light to interfere in our elections. He must be impeached. 
We need a New Voting Rights Act that will guarantee no one is kept out of the ballot box.

One week ago, after releasing a plan that included mandatory buybacks of assault weapons, I visited a gun show in Arkansas. Here‚Äôs how it went: 
 Amor Eterno: How El Paso is rebuilding after tragedy.  
This decision is as baffling as it is alarming. Our planet is burning‚Äî the least we can do as a party is debate what to do about it. 
Climate change is our greatest existential threat. If you believe voters deserve to hear how every candidate will meet this challenge, add your name. 
We need to start treating the fight against climate change like our future depends on it‚Äîbecause it does. That‚Äôs why we need a climate debate.
18 years after we entered Afghanistan, U.S. service members are still losing their lives. Our thoughts are with the families of Master Sgt. Louis DeLeon-Figueroa and Master Sgt. Jose Gonzalez. We must end these wars now.
This is how we rewrite our immigration laws in our own image: 
Three weeks have passed since the shooting in El Paso. A study found that‚Äôs how long it takes for America to stop paying attention‚Äîbut we will not forget, we will not stop fighting until we end this epidemic.
This guy knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing‚Äîripping apart an already divided country and inviting violence into our communities. Latinos here in El Paso, throughout America, feel like they have a target on their back. 
When a president calls immigrants rapists and criminals,When a governor tells his supporters to ‚Äútake matters into their own hands‚Äù against them,When our leaders spew hatred, ignorance, and bigotry,We cannot be surprised when it leads to violence. 
In Trump's America, your boss can fire you because of who you love or how you identify. We need to pass The Equality Act. 
 Reporter: Why did it take the tragedy in El Paso for you to start talking about Trump‚Äôs racism?Beto: It didn‚Äôt. It might ha‚Ä¶

We can't wait any longer to act on gun violence. If you're with us, sign up now. 
All countries have video games. All countries struggle with mental health. All countries deal with hatred. But only America has more guns than human beings. To end this epidemic, we need a mandatory buyback of every assault weapon in our country.  
America, 2019. 
They‚Äôre openly detaining U.S. citizens for the sole reason that they‚Äôre Latinx. They've made white nationalism a policy‚Äîand it‚Äôs on us to call it out for what it is.

This president has been bought and paid for by the NRA. We cannot count on him. It is those moms demanding action and the students marching for their lives‚Äîand all of ours‚Äîwho are showing the real leadership we need. 
To end this epidemic of gun violence, we need to not only connect the dots between our president's words and the actions that follow, but connect with one another. Grateful for everyone I met at the Iowa State Capitol for a round table this morning. They are leading the way.

For every dollar a white man is paid, black women are paid 61 cents. On Black Women‚Äôs Equal Pay Day, let‚Äôs resolve to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, close the wage gap, and ensure all workers are paid for what they do ‚Äî not who they are.

‚ÄúIn these days of evil Presidentes...‚Äù 
Trump is talking about Greenland and racist policies like ending birthright citizenship to take your eyes off the ball‚Äîoff an economy that's beginning to crater; off a trade war that's wreaking havoc on farmers across America; off his cruel desire to take away your health care. 
Climate change is our greatest existential threat‚Äîand there are few people in the world as devoted to fighting it as Thank you, Governor, for your leadership.
At a gun show, a seller told me we need better background checks. An owner of an AK-47 told me he‚Äôd do anything to keep his kids safe. A Trump supporter told me he‚Äôs open to buybacks. We need to stop writing one another off‚Äîbecause only together can we end this epidemic.

We're not going to write anyone off or take anyone for granted. That's why we went door to door in Des Moines‚Äîlistening to and learning from those we want to fight for and serve. Big thanks to the supper club who invited us inside for good food and even better conversations.

I met Alek from South Sudan‚Äîone of the immigrants who makes our country great. She‚Äôs studying English, but math already comes easily to her, since she learned it in her home country. Now, she wants to go to college and become a nurse. Proud she‚Äôs in America.

Thousands of kids separated from their parents. Seven children dead as a result of our care. Countless more sleeping on concrete floors under tinfoil blankets. Today, Trump decided the solution is to cage them for longer.The cruelty will only get worse‚Äîuntil we end it. 
Following the lead of the students marching for their lives, and for all of ours, we will end this epidemic. I support their Peace Plan For A Safer America‚Äîand I call on everyone else in this race to do the same. 
Can confirm, it‚Äôs a national model. Thanks for your leadership, Jason.

Before Trump told families who lost loved ones to gun violence; before he told the students marching for our lives and the moms demanding action, he told the NRA he won‚Äôt pass a bill 90% of Americans support. We need to defeat him‚Äîand every politician who bows before the NRA.

99 years ago, women fought for and won the right to vote with the 19th Amendment‚Äîbut not all women. Women of color remained disenfranchised for decades; many are still left out today. We must finish the job, and ensure every American's voice can finally be heard in our democracy.
Chuck asked whether we need to stop talking about health care to focus on Donald Trump.The answer is no. We must do both. Because if we don‚Äôt provide health care to every American, if we don‚Äôt fix our economy, we‚Äòll provide fertile ground for demagogues like Trump to rise.

In Mississippi, children were separated from their parents‚Äîa 4 month-old from her breast feeding mother. We need to shock the conscience of America, because future generations will ask: "When you faced this moment, did you stand up to be counted?" Our answer better be yes. 
Our country was founded on racism‚Äîand is still racist today. In Arkansas, I said why I believe there‚Äôs no denying this reality; and why it‚Äôs on all of us to change it. 
When in Arkansas, you Call The Hogs. 
 WATCH: Why is Beto O'Rourke campaigning in Arkansas instead of early primary states like Iowa?  
We ran into some supporters in Little Rock who were helping their friend Anna move in, and decided to surprise her by lending a hand. 
Yeah. I've seen them. 70% of Americans support an assault weapons ban, including most Republicans.  
In AR, I told the story of a woman I met in MS who came to America after she was nearly stabbed to death in Guatemala‚Äîbut still has to worry about being deported back to a place where she'll die. In a democracy, all of us are responsible for this; and it's on all of us to fix it. 
Whenever anyone tells you that we can't reduce gun violence, think about the students marching for their lives‚Äîand for all of ours‚Äîand the moms demanding action across our country. Following their lead, we will end this epidemic. 
Insulin costs $450 a month. An AR-15 costs $395 for a lifetime. It shouldn‚Äôt be more affordable to kill than to stay alive.
In Arkansas, I listened to gun owners and sellers‚Äîand appreciated hearing their perspectives. But as the plan we released yesterday says, if I‚Äôm president, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy weapons of war for $395. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy them at all. 
We won‚Äôt solve the challenges we face with half steps, half measures, or half the country. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre going everywhere, including to gun shows, to meet Americans where they are‚Äîand bring them into our campaign.

More than 600 human beings fell victim to the cruelty, terror, racism, and hate of Donald Trump in Mississippi. But anyone that this president puts down, we are going to lift up. I wrote about my 24 hours in Canton ; Forest, MS.
This is the El Paso I've always known‚Äîa beautiful community of love, unity, and strength. 
I see more clearly than I ever have that we not only need to stop the sale of weapons of war in this country but we need to get them out of our communities altogether. That's why I support a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. 
Thank you for showing solidarity with communities like El Paso and so many others that are living in fear due to the hate that lives in this country‚Äîhate that is perpetuated by a racist president. I‚Äôm committed to showing up ; doing whatever I can to support the Latinx community. 
In America, we have:‚û°329 million people‚û°393 million firearms‚û°39,773 lives claimed by gun violenceIt's time for us to be bold, to stand together, to stand up against those interests who would prevent us from saving lives in this country. Here's how:  
We need universal background checks.No loopholes.No exceptions. 
Anyone this president puts down, we are going to lift up. In those places where Donald Trump has been terrorizing, terrifying, and demeaning our fellow Americans, we are going to show up.  if you are ready to join us in this fight. 
I believe, together, we can bring about the change we need‚Äîand, in the process, restore our faith in humanity, in one another, and in this country. You can read more about our plan to end this epidemic here: 
When any one community is targeted, the very idea of America is under attack. That‚Äôs why we need to all come together to not only connect the dots between the proliferation of hatred across our country and the acceleration of mass shootings, but actually do something about it.
To combat hatred, we will ensure the FBI and DOJ prioritize right wing violence; identify white nationalism as a threat in counterterrorism strategy; and require social media companies to remove hate speech and domestic terrorism from their platforms.
We have, by far, the most ambitious plan to end the epidemic of gun violence in this race. In addition to requiring universal background checks and banning assault weapons, we would also create a nationwide gun licensing program‚Äîand enact a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. 
Today, we are releasing our plan to prevent atrocities like these from happening again‚Äîa plan which would not only reduce gun violence, but also combat the spread of hate and white nationalism taking place through online radicalization.
On August 3rd, my hometown of El Paso, one of the safest cities in America, fell victim to one of the deadliest mass shootings in our country‚Äôs history‚Äîthe result of guns and of hatred fueled by online radicalization, propaganda outlets like Fox News, and a racist president.
When darkness descended on El Paso, our community responded with light‚Äîand love. As nurses and doctors saved life after life, hundreds of my neighbors lined up for hours to donate blood. I will bring their strength, pride, and love with me across the country. Share their stories. 
Unless we change course, this picture will illustrate the chapter on ‚ÄúAmerican fascism‚Äù in our grandkids‚Äô high school textbook. 
We welcome Plano ISD to come play the game here in El Paso‚Äîour strong, safe, beautiful, binational community. Together, we can make it clear that racism and hate have no place in our state or this country. And the proceeds could go towards helping those impacted by this tragedy. 
...which is why we need to do background checks on ‚Äúthem.‚Äù 
They ask, "How does this happen? Is it video games? Is it mental health care? Is it both sides?" No. It's the lack of sensible gun laws, it's the open racism, and it's the Commander-in-Chief of this country. 
In those places where Donald Trump has been terrorizing, terrifying, and demeaning our fellow Americans, that's where you will find me in this campaign. 
When we allow this country to be defined along lines of race, ethnicity, and religion, the end of that road is the end of this idea of America. If at this moment we do not wake up to this threat, then we, as a country, will die in our sleep. 
President Trump, you show great weakness every single day‚Äîwhen you attack women of color, when you degrade the office of the president, and when you ask our allies to stoop to your level. 
This is a moment when we have to show up for one another, for our communities, and for our country. So we‚Äôre asking you. Who are you showing up for? Tell us:  
 I asked about his call for a mandatory gun buyback. Interesting answer ‚Äî including him copping to not pushing‚Ä¶
Though we have not realized the idea of an America for everyone, it is still within our grasp.
Though El Paso bore the brunt of this hatred, this violence, and this inaction, I also know this community holds the answers‚Äînot only for our future in El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez, but for our country.
Anyone this president puts down, we are going to do our best to lift up.
Some have suggested I stay in Texas and run for Senate, but that would not be good enough for for El Paso and it would not be good enough for this country. We must take the fight directly to the source‚Äîto the person that has caused this pain and peril: Donald Trump.
When we legalize those who are in this country, when we free Dreamers from any fear of deportation, when we elevate the asylum seeker and the refugee‚Äînot only is it good for them, it is great for the United States of America.
If we do not tell our story, others will tell it for us.
Not only do we need to end the sale of weapons of war, we must buy those weapons and take them off our streets altogether. It is time for us to be bold, to stand together, to stand up against those interests that will prevent us from saving the lives of our fellow Americans.
If we do not wake up to this threat, then we, as a country, will die in our sleep.
‚ÄúThe land that never has been and yet must be, the land where every man is free.‚Äù ‚Äî¬†Langston Hughes
The bigger the lie, the more obvious the injustice, the more furious the pace of this behavior, the more incapable we have been of seeing it, naming it, and acting against it.
What President Trump says, and what he does, does not just offend our sensibilities or our understanding of the traditions of this great country, it changes who we are as a country.
We have a Congress too craven to act, a democracy not up to the task, complicity from those in public trust. We have a racism in America that is as old as America itself. That is what has happened in this country. We need to acknowledge it if we are ever going to change it.
After this tragedy, we showed how strong we are‚Äîand provided an example to the rest of the country of who we can become as America.

The words on the Statue of Liberty won‚Äôt be changed at the racist whims of this administration‚Äîand neither will the character of this country. 
Kids. Kids being forced to console their classmates, their friends, their siblings‚Äîto explain to one another that the world is less safe than they might have thought. This should not be America, but for as long as we refuse to act on guns and hate, it will be. So it's up to us. 
When a white terrorist drove more than 600 miles to hunt and kill Hispanic people in my hometown, he followed a path of vile inspiration that reaches from the darkest chapters of our history and runs directly to the White House today.My CNN op-ed:

Last night, Amy and I brought the kids to the El Paso Legends Charity Soccer Game to support victims of last Saturday‚Äôs shooting. The strength, the joy, the resilience on display last night was another reminder that, in El Paso, we will always meet darkness with light‚Äîand love. 
Legal. Undocumented. Refugee. Asylum Seeker. The distinctions don't matter to President Trump. If you're an immigrant, he believes you have no place in this country‚Äîeven though, for 243 years, immigrants have made America the greatest nation the world has ever known. 
Two years ago, neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville‚Äîand killed a woman named Heather Heyer. This violence has metastasized from Pittsburgh to El Paso; and the violence will continue until we defeat this hatred and the man endorsing these ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù from the Oval Office.
 This morning, I again spent time at the memorial site where the deadliest massacre of Latinos in American history took place‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs not just Trump. It‚Äôs Fox. 
When Trump says he wants more immigrants from Nordic countries‚Äîbut calls African nations shithole countries‚Äîit is very clear the president is a white supremacist. This isn't only offensive to our sensibilities. As we saw in El Paso, it's killing people in this country right now. 
Last Saturday, members of our community were selling lemonade and horchata outside of Walmart to raise money for Fusion FC, a local girls' soccer team. Six of them were shot at point blank range. Today, there is a charity game for the victims. I hope to see you there.

When President Trump visited University Medical Center in the aftermath of one of the deadliest mass shootings in history, instead of consoling our community, he bragged about how much people love him. That shows you how sick this guy is‚Äîand how unfit he is for office.

Reverend Sharpton asked me why I call President Trump a white supremacist. My answer? Through his words, through his actions, and through his policies, he's made the case for all of us. Here's how:

This story highlights something that‚Äôs been overlooked in the coverage of what happened in El Paso: This wasn‚Äôt only a mass shooting. It was a terrorist attack, a hate crime, directed not only at the people in that Walmart, but at the entire Latinx community. 
El Paso will never be defined by the shooter who drove 600 miles to bring terror to our home. We will be defined by how heroes in our binational community have come together to restore our faith in humanity. Today, take a moment to listen to some of their stories: 
Thrilled to join with this morning at the March for a United America in El Paso. Together, we are showing the world that hate has no home here.  
White nationalist terrorism is an epidemic‚Äîand we need a president who fights, rather than fuels, this hatred. 
I‚Äôll be there. 
Another 252 people have been killed by gun violence in America since the massacre in El Paso.
Thank you, all. Wish I could be there with you. We are all so grateful for your support. Together, we will end this crisis. 
En estos momentos de odio y racismo debemos mostrar nuestra hermandad fronteriza y con toda la comunidad Hispana. Estamos contigo Ciudad Ju√°rez.In these moments of hate and racism, we must show solidarity across the border ; with the Hispanic community. We're with you, Ju√°rez. 
There‚Äôs ‚Äúevil‚Äù in every country, Governor. America is different because we‚Äôre the only country with more guns than people. 
They've confirmed what we already knew: A white terrorist drove 600 miles to hunt and kill Hispanic people in our community, following a path of vile inspiration that reaches from the darkest chapters of history and runs directly to the White House today.
Five years ago, Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer. In the years since, we‚Äôve heard too many names, too many similar stories, to count. In each, we are reminded of an idea as urgent, and as ignored, today as it was when Michael was killed: Black Lives Matter.
 We wanted to pass along this information with anyone who would like to speak to a behavioral health professional. 
‚ÄúLove and peace will always define who we are‚Äîon both sides of the border. We will rise above this.‚Äù -Diana, Student Body Vice President Grateful for these extraordinary student leaders who brought the community together for this morning‚Äôs memorial. 
If you're angry or upset, if you want to do something, you can make a difference. Here's how you can help the families affected by the raids in Mississippi: 
She is not a "rapist" or a "criminal." She is not an "animal" or an "infestation." She's a daughter who misses her father‚Äîand has no idea when she'll see him again. She will struggle with this trauma for the rest of her life. We‚Äôll have it on our conscience for the rest of ours. 
8 more people died from gun violence today.
Mi coraz√≥n est√° con Ju√°rez. Mi coraz√≥n est√° con El Paso. Mi coraz√≥n est√° con nuestra comunidad fuerte, bonita y binacional. My heart is with Ju√°rez. My heart is with El Paso. My heart is with our strong, beautiful, binational community. 
I went to Ciudad Ju√°rez today because eight Mexican citizens died in our country‚Äîa consequence of our gun laws, of our president's racism, and of websites like yours, which are havens for white supremacy. 
This is how Trump responded to someone saying we should shoot immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees. 
 'We are with you': Beto O'Rourke attends victim's funeral in Ju√°rez after El Paso shooting 
Hoy fui a Ciudad Ju√°rez porque esta tragedia afect√≥ a familias de ambos lados de la frontera. Nuestras ciudades son una sola comunidad que fue atacada por el racisimo y odio. Pero juntos podemos salir adelante. 
We must confront hate, no matter where it is or how high up it goes. That means calling out this president‚Äîbut it also means ensuring social media companies no longer allow hate speech to be spread on their platforms. 
El Paso and Ju√°rez form the largest binational community in our hemisphere‚Äîunited, not divided, by bridges like this one. Today, we mourned the lives lost, but resolved to never be torn apart by hate‚Äîbecause together, we make something far greater than the sum of our parts.

Honored to be in Ju√°rez today to send my condolences to Governor Corral, Mayor Cabada, and everyone who lives in the Mexican half of our binational community. Together, we have responded to hatred with love‚Äîand our communities are stronger, and closer, than we've ever been. 
Es un honor estar en Ciudad Ju√°rez para darle mis condolencias al Gobernador Corral, al Alcalde Cabada, y a todos los que viven en la mitad mexicana de nuestra comunidad binacional. Hemos respondido al odio con amor, y nuestras comunidades est√°n m√°s fuertes y unidas que antes. 
Perdimos a gente de los dos lados de la frontera. Estamos sufriendo de los dos lados de la frontera. Pero unida, esta comunidad binacional va a salir adelante y ser el ejemplo para el resto de este pa√≠s. 
This community is focused on healing. Not hatred. Not racism. Certainly not crowd sizes. Our community ‚Äî and our country ‚Äî will not be defined by smallness. We will be defined by the love, compassion, and strength of El Paso. 
This is a really tough time for El Paso, but we are a really tough people. The way this community of immigrants has come together is the best possible answer to the hatred and the terror and the racism we saw on Saturday. 
Each day, we are made lower by this administration‚Äôs cruelty. 
El Paso continues to meet darkness with light‚Äîand love. Proud of this community, and the hundreds who were out at the memorial last night. 
13 more people died from gun violence today.
These children will go to sleep tonight with no idea when, or if, they‚Äôll see their parents again. This is being done in our name‚Äîand it‚Äôs on all of us to end it. 
  El Paso I am proud of you, El Paso I love you. 
Only days after a massacre committed with the express purpose of targeting immigrants, Trump conducted the largest raid of his presidency. 680 human beings arrested, including the mother of a 13-year-old, who waved goodbye as she was taken from him. The cruelty knows no bounds. 
 We are deeply grateful for how much love you have shown our community. We feel the support, and we appreciate it.
 Thank you so much for your support. We are all so appreciative of how much love you have shown our community.
Despite the evidence, despite the threat to our country that domestic terrorism poses, this president did nothing. He made us less safe. 
Donald Trump has been very clear about who he wants to keep out of this country ‚Äî with walls and cages and militarization and torture and cruelty. We in El Paso have borne the brunt of that, but we in El Paso are standing up to that.

Thank you for your leadership, When President Trump comes to El Paso tomorrow, I will be joining our strong, beautiful, binational community at  I hope to see you there.  
On Saturday, El Paso didn't only face a mass shooting. We faced an act of domestic terrorism directed toward our Latinx community. To those living in fear today, I want you to know: We hear you. We stand with you. This hate will not win. 
The entire team working tirelessly at University Medical Center and Del Sol Medical Center have performed miracles over the past few days. They are El Paso‚Äîthe strength, the love, the care, the willingness to do everything possible to help their neighbors. I am forever grateful.

I've always thought the example set by El Paso could offer a path forward for a country that is so consumed by our differences and our divisions.Si queremos asegurar nuestro pa√≠s, I often say, necesitamos seguir el ejemplo de El Paso. 
 This is who we lost on Saturday. Many more are injured. These are the human beings who will never be with us again. And there are so many people like them, who die because of gun violence every year. We have the power to end this crisis. And we don‚Äôt have time to wait.
 22 esta semana en El Paso. Casi 40,000 cada a√±o en todo el pa√≠s. Los n√∫meros son desgarradores, pero no capturan la tragedia de cada una de estas p√©rdidas. Por eso estoy compartiendo las historias de todos los que perdimos. Conozca sus historias aqu√≠: 
Thank you to  and so many other news organizations for doing the important work of bringing a human face to all those who lost their lives this weekend.
Juan de Dios Vel√°zquez Chairez. Juan and his wife, Nicholasa, shopped together every week. Juan was from Zacatecas, Mexico, but had lived in our city for two years. Nicholasa was injured in the shooting. Juan lost his life at 77 years-old.
Margie Reckard. 63 years-old. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like a puppy run away from its momma,‚Äù said Antonio Basco, her husband of 22 years. ‚ÄúBut my wife, she‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòGet up off your rear end.'‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúI know she‚Äôs looking down and she‚Äôs smiling.‚Äù
Leo Campos. 41 years-old. Maribel Hernandez. 56 years-old. They went to Walmart after leaving their dog to be groomed. When Maribel‚Äôs brother heard they never came to pick him up, he feared the worst. Soon, it was confirmed: Leo and Maribel had both lost their lives.
Angie Silva Englisbee. 86 years-old. This wasn‚Äôt the first time Angie experienced tragedy. Her husband died at 38 years-old, leaving her to raise seven kids by herself. Her grandson called her ‚Äúthe hero of our family.‚Äù She, too, was killed.
Maria Flores and Ra√∫l Flores. The couple went to Walmart on Saturday morning and never came home. They were 77 years-old. Both of them.
Alexander Gerhard Hoffman. Alexander also wasn‚Äôt from the United States. He was from Germany‚Äîbut he lost his life visiting our country at 66-year-old.
Sara Esther Regalado. 66 years-old. Adolfo Cerros Hern√°ndez. 68 years-old. They, too, were from Mexico‚Äîand are remembered as being loving parents. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how long it will take for my soul to heal,‚Äù their daughter wrote.
Elsa Mendoza M√°rquez. 57 years-old. Elsa lived across the border in Ju√°rez, where she was a teacher. When she ran into Walmart to buy supplies for her students in Ju√°rez, her husband and son waited outside in the car. They survived the shooting. Tragically, she did not.
Iv√°n Manzano. Like Gloria, Iv√°n was from Ju√°rez, where so many of our neighbors live. He was 46 years-old when he lost his life in our country.
Gloria Irma M√°rquez. A mother of four and a grandmother, Gloria was from Ju√°rez‚Äîpart of our binational community. She lost her life at 61 years-old because our country failed to protect her.
Luis Alfonzo Ju√°rez. 90 years-old. His wife, who he‚Äôd been married to for almost 70 years, was also a victim of Saturday‚Äôs shooting. He didn‚Äôt make it‚Äîbut thankfully, she did. I was able to meet their family at the hospital, and they're showing this community's strength.
Teresa Sanchez. At 82 years-old, Teresa bore the brunt of evil on Saturday. She was from Mexico as well.
Mar√≠a Eugenia Legarreta Rothe. 58 years-old. Mar√≠a is from Chihuahua, Mexico‚Äîand was only here so she could be at the El Paso airport when her daughter arrived.
Jorge Calvillo Garc√≠a. At 61 years-old, Jorge passed away this weekend while protecting his granddaughter. He was from Torre√≥n, Mexico. His son, Luis Calvillo, was shot as well. They were outside of Walmart on Saturday, raising funds for EP Fusion, a local girls' soccer team.
David Johnson. 63 years-old. When hatred entered Walmart on Saturday morning, David responded by protecting his wife and his 9 year-old granddaughter. He passed away, but they survived.
Arturo Benavides. 60 years-old. An Army veteran and a bus driver‚Äîhe spent his life serving our community and our country. His wife was with him in Walmart. She made it out. He did not.
His classmates organized a vigil for him. No student should ever have to do that. I met two of them while in line to donate blood, and they invited me out. Seeing the entire school community come out to that football field gave me hope. This generation will end this epidemic.
Javier Rodr√≠guez. 15. I‚Äôll say it again: 15 years-old. A student ready to start his sophomore year, a soccer player ready to start another season. His whole life ahead of him. His sister says she ‚Äúlost my everything, my best friend.‚Äù
Andre Anchondo. Jordan‚Äôs husband. 23 years-old. They married last year. He‚Äôd just finished building their family a home. Saturday was going to be the first time family ; friends would see it. But he, too, was killed‚Äîwhile shielding his wife, who was shielding their son.
Jordan Anchondo. 24 years-old. She went to Walmart to buy school supplies‚Äîand decorations for her daughter‚Äôs 6th birthday party. When the gunman entered, she shielded her 2-month-old son. Jordan didn‚Äôt make it, but her son did.
22 in El Paso this week. Nearly 40,000 in our country each year. The numbers are heartbreaking, but they don't capture the tragedy of each ; every one of those deaths. That‚Äôs why I am sharing the stories of all those who lost their lives in El Paso this weekend.
We can‚Äôt solve any of our challenges‚Äîfrom gun violence to climate change‚Äîuntil we fix our democracy. 54 years ago, the Voting Rights Act was signed, but millions are still silenced by suppression.We need a New Voting Rights Act, so every vote is counted ; every voice is heard.
A black man, dragged with a rope by police officers on horses, in 2019. This moment demands accountability, justice, and honestly‚Äîbecause we need to call this out for what it is: racism at work.  
After the Santa Fe shooting, I reached out to students who survived it and parents whose children did not. After Saturday, they reached out to me. Whenever I start to lose hope, I remember their strength. If we follow the lead of these young people, I know we can end this crisis.

You cannot leave it up to me. Members of the press: You too have to call him out for being the most racist president since Andrew Johnson. 
We very consciously started out 243 years ago on the premise that we're all created equal. We never quite lived up to it, but until now, until this administration, we never stopped trying. 
Unbelievable. 
He had a "rape list," but he was allowed to buy a gun. This isn't an isolated incident. Across our country, women who face violence are ignored and dismissed. We need to support women and prevent those who threaten them from ever acquiring weapons of war.

Just finished donating blood. Thank you, Jennifer, for taking great care of Amy and me. Everyone who can do this should do it‚Äînot only after tragedies, but all year round. It's easy and it saves lives. Spread the word. 
This president, who helped create the hatred that made Saturday's tragedy possible, should not come to El Paso. We do not need more division. We need to heal. He has no place here.

 Thank you, Tim. Sending love to Ohio.
Thank you, President Obama. 
El Presidente ha tratado de convencer a los estadounidenses que los inmigrantes de M√©xico son una amenaza ‚Äî pero este fin de semana, fueron las leyes de armas de nuestro pa√≠s que mataron a ocho ciudadanos mexicanos. Mi coraz√≥n est√° con ellos y sus familias.
The President has tried to convince Americans that Mexican immigrants are a threat to our security‚Äîbut this weekend, it was our country's gun laws that killed eight Mexican citizens. My heart is with them.
Update: Over the weekend, 53 of our fellow human beings were shot in Chicago. Seven of them died. This epidemic will not end until we treat every death like the tragedy it is‚Äîand until we finally do something about it.  
We lost another life. Please continue to keep our community in your hearts‚Äîand commit to doing everything you can to end this epidemic. 
Here's why I'm more hopeful than I've ever been. 
 "Though we bore the brunt of this hatred, we're also the best example for [the U.S.] going forward. A city of immigrants t‚Ä¶
Only a racist, driven by fear, could witness what took place this weekend‚Äîand instead of standing up to hatred, side with a mass murderer's call to make our country more white. We are so much better than this president. 
This president‚Äôs open racism is an invitation to violence. The writing has been on the wall since his maiden speech coming down that escalator calling immigrants "rapists and criminals." The actions that follow cannot surprise us. 
We know what Trump is doing. He stokes racism. He incites violence. We shouldn‚Äôt be asking if there‚Äôs anything he can do or if he‚Äôs responsible for this when we know the answer. I stand by what I said. 
Sending love to Chicago, where another seven human beings were shot. You are in our hearts. And together, we will end this crisis.

Everyone is doing their part. Giving time, energy, money, support. Those giving blood were seeing their neighbors and co-workers doing the same. Just so proud of this city and the example we're setting for our kids. This beautiful amazing courageous community will overcome.
Amy and I just got back from the blood bank. Ulysses, Molly, and Henry wanted to come along, and I'm glad they did because we really saw the very best of this community. People had been waiting since 7:30 a.m. to donate while others were in line to drop off food, water, supplies. 
When hate arrived in El Paso, our community responded with love, strength, and courage. Today, I visited a Vitalant blood donation center in El Paso, where lines have stretched around the block. They told me they were so grateful‚Äîand reminded me they need donations year round. 
Tonight, El Paso is standing up against hate, in memory of the lives lost yesterday, and with the resolve to stop this from happening again. Join us:6pm: Silent March from Houston Park (Ange St and Yandell Dr) 7pm: Vigil (1500 Yandell Dr)
Ayer, una persona trajo su odio y racismo a nuestra comunidad. El Paso es una de las comunidades m√°s seguras porque somos una comunidad de migrantes, gente que viene a mejorar a este pa√≠s. 
Two people, from two countries, speaking two languages‚Äîunited, not divided, by our border. Together, we form a whole far greater than the sum of our parts: a community I‚Äôm so proud to call home. 
El Paso is one of the strongest communities on the planet. Everyone donating blood, bringing food to University Medical Center, ; rallying for those families makes me so inspired‚Äîand they've got to compel us to do everything possible to make sure this does not continue to happen. 
A victim's wife asked me, "How do we change this?"In addition to universal background checks, a ban on the sale of weapons of war, ; red flag laws, we have got to acknowledge the hatred and open racism we're seeing on Fox News, on the internet, and from our Commander-in-Chief. 
 Jake Tapper: Do you think President Trump is a white nationalist?Beto O‚ÄôRourke: Yes, I do  
El Paso is a community that shows up for one another‚Äîon our best days and our worst. I met Rosemary‚Äôs family on the plane back to El Paso. They asked that we visit her and share her story. She was shot in the chest but is doing well after surgery. She‚Äôs strong‚Äîjust like our city. 
My heart is broken. For El Paso. For Dayton. For everyone who is impacted by the 40,000 gun deaths in our country every year. It‚Äôs on each and every one of us to end this crisis‚Äîand together, I still have faith that we will.
Love you, El Paso.
President Trump's racism does not just offend our sensibilities; it fundamentally changes the character of this country. And it leads to violence. 
 Thank you, Senator Warren. Grateful for your kind words and all of the work you're doing to end this epidemic.
Ofrezco mi m√°s sentido p√©same a las familias de las v√≠ctimas. Tenemos una comunidad muy fuerte y estoy muy orgulloso de El Paso. 
This community is bringing more food than anybody can eat ; is donating more blood than we could have expected. We need to change our laws so it's harder for something like this to happen again‚Äîbut we also need to stand up to the hatred ; racism that leads to events like this. 
Any illusion we had that progress is inevitable‚Äîor that the change we need is going to come of its own accord‚Äîis shattered in moments like this. It is on every single one of us to meet this moment with everything we've got as a country. We will make this right. 
Si necesitas ayuda, pero tienes miedo de contactar a las autoridades en El Paso, ayuda a todos sin importar su estatus migratorio.

But as long as this is happening anywhere in America, we must keep up the fight. With what we did in Homestead as an example, we'll continue the work to close all private detention centers, end family separation ; stop the detention of those who pose no threat to our communities.
The last child has left Homestead. It‚Äôs good news for these kids and our country. It once again proves the incredible power of people in our democracy. To those who showed up, protested, kept watch, kept the public pressure on, ; demanded we all do the same‚Äîyou made this happen.

Fire Pantaleo. There must be accountability ‚Äî and there must be justice. 
I‚Äôll be there. 
Last night, Trump responded to the Democratic debates, but the truth is: We already gave him what he wanted. Let‚Äôs stop tearing one another apart‚Äîand remember that no matter who we nominate, all of us will need to come together to defeat Donald Trump. 
America is so much better than this ‚Äî but it‚Äôs on all of us to prove it. 
Each day, Trump lowers the office and demonstrates to the American people how unfit he is to lead this country.
Not only do we need to raise the minimum wage so that it's finally a living wage but we also need to elevate the voice of workers and strengthen unions across the country. Learned a lot from April, gained new perspectives, and will continue to fight for workers like her each day.
April is a home care worker in Las Vegas where she makes $11/hour helping clients like Shevawn. She works another job after her shifts end, has four kids, and doesn't get home until 11:00. My thanks to April and for allowing me to spend the day walking in her shoes.

But we know the work goes well beyond access to the ballot box. It's educational opportunities, banning the box, ; finally investing real resources in restorative justice programs that assist with successfully transitioning formerly incarcerated individuals back into communities.
To reform our broken justice system, we need to listen to, learn from, and include the perspectives of people who have been locked up and locked out by it. Grateful for the powerful discussion in Nevada. We must restore the voting rights of Americans who have served their time. 
Whatever our differences, before we're anything else, we're Americans first. We will ensure that each of us is well enough, educated enough, paid enough to realize our full potential. Together, we will meet these challenges at home and lead the world in those that we face abroad. 
Trump's gag rule is an attack on women, their health care, and their rights. I stand with in fighting these dangerous efforts. Regardless of income, everyone should have access to reproductive health care‚Äîand that includes abortion. 
Growing up in a city of immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees, I learned what‚Äôs best about America. Here's my story. 
Great lunch in Macomb County with a few Republicans, some Democrats, and a lot of Independents. No me importa. We're Americans first before anything else. Everyone is deserving of being heard, fought for, and served. That's how we'll defeat Trump and bring this country together. 
We must protect every worker‚Äôs right to form or join a union. It‚Äôs long overdue that fairly negotiate with the six locations that voted to unionize. I stand with in their efforts to support working people across NV. Management must come to the table.
Last night, I brought up the urgent need to confront the legacy of slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and suppression‚Äîhow people have been kept down and kept out based on their race. It‚Äôs the only way that we‚Äôll repair the damage done and keep from repeating these injustices again. 
Really appreciate everyone across the country who hosted or attended our debate watch parties. It was great knowing I had your support up on stage. 
Last night's debate covered a lot of topics. But there are so many more that weren't brought up. If you want to know where I stand on all of the issues, check out the plans section of our website:

Donald Trump is a racist.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna kill me!"These were some of Tony‚Äôs last words before officers did exactly that. He wailed ; pleaded for help more than 30 times but received none. We must not only demand justice but reform policing across the US so those sworn to protect us don't do the opposite. 
In 2018, we put Texas in play for the first time in decades. In 2020, we're going to win it. And the state's 38 electoral votes will ensure that we defeat Donald Trump.

To meet the challenges we face, we have to have hope in one another‚Äîand a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone. 
In Congress, we worked with Republicans and Democrats to expand mental health care to veterans and got it signed into law by the one person I agree with about almost nothing: Donald Trump. 
We will defeat Donald Trump in 2020‚Äîand bring our country together in 2021.
The legacy of slavery and segregation and suppression is alive and well. We need to root out racism from every aspect of our society‚Äîfrom our economy to our healthcare system to our schools to our democracy. 
I will end the War in Afghanistan, but also bring our service-members home from Iraq, Somalia, and Yemen. We don‚Äôt need war to solve these challenges. We can do it with diplomacy.
We need to make sure every single American can afford to go to college. 
The legacy of slavery ; segregation ; suppression is alive and well in every aspect of our economy and our country. We need a New Voting Rights Act, we need to pass a reparations bill, and we need to ensure every student has a quality education, no matter what they look like.
The way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet was on the back of people who were kidnapped and brought here by force. I will sign Sheila Jackson Lee‚Äôs reparation bill so that we can have the national conversation we have waited too long to have.

President Trump's racism doesn't just offend our sensibilities. It is changing this country. We must not only tolerate our differences, but embrace them.

Living in El Paso, home to Fort Bliss, has formed my belief that our Commander-in-Chief has no responsibility more sacred than protecting the security of America and our troops‚Äîincluding those who are no longer in uniform. Here‚Äôs our plan. 
There's a new battleground state: Texas. And it has 38 electoral college votes. 

This moment will define us forever.  And I believe that America will be redeemed. 
As president, I will make sure our government is run not by PACs or lobbyists or corporations, but by the people. Here‚Äôs our plan. 
Here's how we end the gun violence epidemic. 
We need to rewrite our immigration laws in our own image, by:1‚É£Ending Family Separation2‚É£Reuniting Families3‚É£Reforming Asylum Laws4‚É£Rewriting Immigration Laws5‚É£Making Dreamers Citizens6‚É£Providing a Pathway to Citizenship7‚É£Ensuring Regional Security
The answer is no: We do not need to raise taxes on the middle class to guarantee high-quality health care to every single American.
We don't have to choose between the status quo, which leaves millions of Americans uninsured, and a plan that eliminates private insurance entirely. Medicare for America is the best way to achieve universal, high-quality, guaranteed health care. 
We will be the nation that chooses to stand up for the human rights of everyone.
At this moment of truth, let us choose to fulfill our national promise, and make a more perfect union of everyone, by everyone, and for everyone. 
Whatever our differences, we know that before we are anything else, we are all Americans first. And together we will work to ensure that each of us is well enough; educated enough; paid enough to realize our full potential. 
I‚Äôm running for President because I believe America discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need. 
They will keep separating kids from their parents until President Trump is out of office. And it's on all of us to get that done.

In the face of the most dangerous and divisive president we've ever had, we must remember that for 243 years strong, asylum seekers, immigrants and refugees have helped make the United States of America the greatest country the world has ever known. 
It was a lot more than a spaghetti dinner. Amy and I will never forget Mae and David, Essie and Justin, Miss Dotson and her daughter, everyone in Flint who welcomed us and inspired us. We're going to fight for them and for America.  to share their powerful story. 
Ban the sale of assault weapons. 
Since launching, we've listened to people across America‚Äîfrom Sioux City, IA to Nashville, TN. With your stories in mind, we are releasing our plans on dozens of issues, from maternal mortality to national security. Excited to hear what you think! 
As Trump continues to disgrace our country at home and abroad, 9/11 first responders and their families are a reminder of the very best of America. We will never forget their service to our country. 
In order to overcome the greatest challenges we face, we must first fix our democracy and return power to people. Proud to be named a  candidate by as we deliver on this urgent agenda. 
Sending love to all who are hurting tonight‚Äîand all who are affected by the 40,000 gun deaths in America each year. We can accept this as our fate or we can change it. Following the lead of the students marching for their lives, and for all of ours, I know we can end this crisis.
Thank you, James! In Iowa and across the country, our campaign is only possible because of people like you. 
This is a moment of truth for our country‚Äîthe cruelty of kids in cages, the open racism of ‚Äúsend them back,‚Äù the unchecked tyranny of a lawless president. We have to all stand up to be counted right now, and we have to stand together to defeat this bully. 
In his words and in his actions, Trump has been the most openly racist president we‚Äôve had in modern history. He is trying to change the very character of America. But we won't let him. We are so much better than this intolerance and hatred‚Äîand together, we're going to prove it. 
Deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision. I‚Äôve long opposed building walls, and while in Congress, I introduced language to prevent DOD funds from being used to plan or build a wall along our border. As President, I would do everything in my power to make that law.
We don't need more walls. They don't make us more safe. 
Hope you enjoy one of the safest cities in America‚Äîsafe not in spite of the fact that we‚Äôre a city of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, but because we‚Äôre a city of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. 
Earlier this year, I unveiled a plan that not only reverses the transgender troop ban but protects LGBTQ+ rights and finally secures comprehensive legal protection for members of the LGBTQ+ community. Read it here:  
Two years ago today, Trump turned his back on transgender service members across the country and stationed around the world. I will repeal his discriminatory and hateful transgender troop ban and replace it with the Equality Act to ensure full civil rights for LGBTQ+ Americans.

This is more than an attack on election systems. It's an attack on our democracy. And yet, Republicans in the Senate refuse to bring bills to the floor that would help prevent this from happening again. We must come together to protect our democracy before it's too late. 
We need to ensure every child ‚Äî no matter who they are, what they look like, or where they're from ‚Äî has access to a quality education. That's true in New Hampshire, and it's true across the country.

Thank you to Flint for sharing your ideas, perspectives, and hope for the future with me. I can't wait to see you again soon. 
Abolish the death penalty.
We need to hold every single person who detained an 18-year-old American citizen for 3 weeks‚Äîfor no reason other than the color of his skin‚Äîaccountable. But we also must demand justice for the immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees who are subject to these conditions every day. 
Puerto Ricans stood up, relentless in their demand for change, even when they were told it was impossible. Tonight, their voices were heard. Rossell√≥‚Äôs resignation is a reminder of the power of the people‚Äîand of our ability to bring about change. ¬°Felicidades, Puerto Rico! 
 I love that a key piece of education play is debt relief for educators.  
By going everywhere, bringing everyone in, and not allowing our differences to divide us or define us at this critical moment, we are going to defeat Donald Trump and bring this country together to meet the greatest challenges we've ever faced. 
Truly inspired by everyone I met in Flint‚Äîa community that has never quit and never become hopeless, but has instead come together to build a brighter future. Grateful for the welcome, the ideas, and the conversations. I believe in Flint, and Flint makes me believe in America.

Mueller made clear that there was a systematic effort to undermine our democracy in 2016 and that Donald Trump has attempted to obstruct the investigation from learning the truth behind those attacks. Trump must be impeached.
There must be consequences, accountability, and justice. Congress must begin impeachment proceedings.
When a president obstructs justice, then tries to prevent an investigation into his actions, he has committed an impeachable offense. Tell Congressional Democrats to take action.
Donald Trump obstructed justice. He must be impeached.
Mueller has explicitly stated that his report did not exonerate the president. Trump‚Äôs denial of this fact and his pattern of lies are nothing new. He has committed impeachable offenses, and Congress must act.
Our schools‚Äîeducators ; admins, bus drivers ; cafeteria workers‚Äîare responsible for shaping our future. We need to provide them with the resources they need to educate our next generation of leaders. This is how we'll do it: 
Children of color make up more than half the student population‚Äîbut only 20% of public school teachers are people of color. Our plan will devote $500 million per year to create-world class teacher academies at MSIs and HBCUs, so more students can have teachers who look like them.
We know that children of color are more likely to be punished than their white peers. As president, I will end the school-to-prison pipeline‚Äîbanning corporal punishment in schools, funding restorative justice programs, and building educator prep programs to address racial bias.
To close the $23 billion funding gap between white and non-white school districts, we will dedicate $500 billion toward the creation of a Permanent Fund for Equity and Excellence in education.
As president, I will also fully fund the IDEA, devote $100 billion to addressing physical and digital infrastructure in schools, and take specific steps to address structural inequities in our education system.
At a time when too many educators are working a second or third job just to make ends meet, our plan will ensure they're finally paid a professional wage across the country. And we're going to immediately forgive their outstanding student loan debt. Tax-free.
For the sake of our economy, democracy, and future, we need to ensure every student‚Äîno matter who they are, what they look like, or where they live‚Äîhas access to a quality education. Here‚Äôs my plan to do it: 
Thank you, John. Thank you, Jon. Thank you to all of the 9/11 first responders and their families who didn't stop fighting for the dignity, honor, and financial security they should have received long ago. We will never forget their service to our country. 
Hope you'll be tuning into at 12:35/11:35c!

This is good news. But Francisco should never have been in custody in the first place‚Äîlet alone for three weeks. We must demand accountability and we must demand justice. 
If you believe our country can rise above this president‚Äôs hatred, you're in the right place. Join us: 
The President is a racist. Shouting ‚Äúsend them back‚Äù at a rally is racist. I will not apologize for saying so. But I believe Americans‚ÄîDemocrats and Republicans alike‚Äîare ready to rise above Trump's bigotry. And I believe, together, we will. 
Love you, Amy. Couldn't ask for a better partner to be running this race with. 
Francisco Erwin Galicia is an American, a citizen, an 18-year-old who has been detained for 3 weeks because of the color of his skin. CBP must release him immediately ; this country must demand accountability for what has happened to him. We'll prove that we're better than this. 
I don't care who you voted for last time or if you voted at all. I don't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent. No me importa. We are Americans first before anything else‚Äîand I call you to this country's greatness. Let's get out there and achieve it. 
Two years after passing a $2 trillion tax cut for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, Trump wants to take food away from 3 million human beings under the guise of caring about deficits. This is an attack on those who need help most. We need to fight for them. 
Amy and I are looking forward to being on this morning. Join us at 11 ET on ABC!

We're going to rise above the smallness, pettiness, weakness, racism, and bigotry of this president with the courage and confidence, ambitions and aspirations, resolve and creativity at the heart of this country‚Äîwith all of us coming together. We're ready to do that work. 
Really fortunate to have Danya on our team! Proud of what we're all building in Iowa and across the country. 
  Exclusive: "Being here at Ellis Island is a reminder of American history at its best and at its worst. Trump‚Ä¶
Ultimately, this is about continuing the work of Dr. Nixon. Making sure every voice is heard and every vote is counted. Read our full voting rights plan here:
Our voting rights plan returns power to people. It will:üîµEnact automatic ; same-day registrationüîµMake Election Day a federal holidayüîµProtect the Voting Rights ActüîµAbolish racist voter ID lawsüîµIncrease turnout to 65%üîµBan PAC contributionsüîµEnd gerrymandering
As president, I will make sure every single American is empowered to vote‚Äîand that those who have historically been drawn out of our democracy are able to make their voices heard so this country can live up to its full promise and potential.
In recent years, Jim Crow-era poll taxes and grandfather clauses have been replaced with other insidious forms of suppression, ranging from racist voter ID laws that reduce turnout to gerrymandering efforts that undermine the very notion that all of our votes count equally.
It took 20 years of court battles but Dr. Nixon was ultimately able to vote on this day 75 years ago. And because of him, and those who fought alongside him, African Americans across the state were able to vote, too. But our work isn‚Äôt finished.
Dr. Nixon took his poll tax receipt into Fire Station No. 5 on Election Day knowing full well he would be refused the right to vote. Turned away on the basis of his race, he mounted a challenge to the all-white primary‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätaking his case to the US Supreme Court not once but twice.
In 1914, he helped organize the El Paso branch of the NAACP, which became the very first chapter of the NAACP in the state. Then in 1924, after Texas passed a law barring African Americans from participating in the primary, Dr. Nixon personally took up the fight against it.
Concerned by Johnson‚Äôs public murder and the number of lynchings occurring across central and east Texas, and perhaps fearing for his own life, Nixon moved west to El Paso, where he became involved with civil rights work and established a successful medical practice.
Born in Marshall, TX in 1884, Nixon attended Wiley College and then received his M.D. in 1906 from Meharry Medical College in Nashville. He began practicing in Cameron before 500 members of the community stormed the jail and lynched an African American man named Alex Johnson.
On this day 75 years ago, Dr. Lawrence Nixon walked into El Paso's Fire Station No. 5‚Äîtwo decades after first being turned away from the very same polling place‚Äîand cast his vote, ending the all-white primary and changing the history of voting rights. I want to share his story: 
Our president has stood with autocrats around the world, from Turkey to Hungary to Pakistan, who have denigrated the free press‚Äîand still hasn't condemned MBS for the assassination of Khashoggi. We need a president who defends the press, not one who disparages it. 
Grateful for the chance to tour Ellis Island with Amy this morning. Looking out at the Statue of Liberty, we are reminded that America has always been, and will always be, a nation of immigrants. 
15,000.15,000 human beings‚Äîparents ; children, colleagues ; neighbors‚Äîlost their lives because states like Texas didn't expand Medicaid.We need universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care‚Äîso in the wealthiest country on earth, no one dies because they aren't covered. 
"Federal inspectors visiting a California migrant detention center made a shocking discovery last year: Detainees had made nooses from bedsheets in 15 of 20 cells in the facility they visited." This is who we are‚Äîuntil we change it. 
Looking forward to our town hall in Flint on Wednesday at 3:30 pm. Join us at Flint's 100k ideas incubator‚Äîwhich provides Flint entrepreneurs with the support they need to start and grow their businesses. 
As president, I will sign into law The Equality Act, which would ban discrimination against all LGBTQ+ Americans in employment, housing, and access to public spaces‚Äîincluding in Texas. Chip in to support our grassroots campaign. 
Really enjoyed spending the afternoon with those who joined us at today‚Äôs volunteer meet up! You are powering this campaign each day by organizing everywhere, bringing everyone in, and believing in what‚Äôs possible for this country when we‚Äôre all willing to fight for it. 
Our drug prices are the most expensive in the world; our gun violence epidemic is the deadliest‚Äîand all of this is symptomatic of a democracy that‚Äôs been captured by corporations. We need to return power back to people. Reginald, appreciate the question.  
In Texas, you can be fired for being gay. You can be denied a home for being gay. You can be barred from adopting a child who needs a loving family because you're gay. Discrimination is an urgent issue in our state. Discrimination against Chick-fil-A is not. 
Seven years after Aurora, we haven't done enough to end gun violence in our schools, our communities, or our country. I'm committed to making this a top priority -- finally achieving universal background checks, stopping the sale of weapons of war, and implementing red flag laws.
 Here‚Äôs my podcast w/  
Our Sioux Center town hall brought us to one of the most conservative counties in Iowa. A place that went 81% for Trump. But those we met believe in this country and believe in our power to change it. It's why we show up everywhere and fight for everyone. Thanks for joining us.

These are the consequences of a president who foments hate every day‚Äîand sees our diversity not as a strength but as a weakness. Erica, thank you for serving your state and thanks to your husband for serving our country. We are better than this, and together, we will prove it. 
 We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better way to start the day than having take questions at La Juanita in Sioux City‚Ä¶
A burning planet. A broken democracy. A rigged economy. These are some of the greatest challenges we've ever faced‚Äîbut with our past as our inspiration and our future as our motivation, I believe, together, we can solve every single one of them.
"We go to the Moon not because it's easy, but because it's hard; because that challenge is one we are willing to accept, unwilling to postpone, and intend to win." On Apollo 11's anniversary, JFK's words remind us that, in America, when we come together, we can do anything.

Big thanks to everyone in Sioux City who came out for tonight's town hall‚Äîfrom Brandy who drove 4 hours, to the regular at the Diving Elk who voted for himself in 2016 but says he's open to another option this time. It'll take all of us to meet this moment. I know that we will. 
 I drove 4.5 hours to hear I was fortunate enough to ask him a question regarding the maternal and infant‚Ä¶
So great to meet Brandy in Sioux City. She's right: Our country will not realize its promise until we close the disparities women of color face in health care, pay, opportunity, maternal mortality, and so much more. Thank you for joining us, Brandy. And thank you for caring. 
I believe in America. Because I believe in all of you. We're going to make sure the rest of the country knows we believe in them. 
This is the best way to guarantee universal, high quality healthcare, dramatically reduce out of pocket expenses, and preserve choice‚Äîso every American can be well enough to live to their full potential. 
We don‚Äôt have to make the false choice between a status quo where millions of Americans are uninsured and millions more can't afford their prescriptions‚Äîand a plan that would force 180 million Americans off their insurance. That's why I support Medicare for America. 
Taking the stage now! Tune in here: 
We need to not only call out what disturbs us about this administration, but call on ourselves to regain the aspirational, ambitious quality of America‚Äîand remind this country who we are at our best. Thank you to for having me on.  
Going door to door in Council Bluffs earlier today to listen to and learn from those we want to fight for in this campaign and in the White House. Thanks to everyone who took the time to introduce themselves. Really great to be back in Iowa! 
This campaign has always been inspired by the people we meet at town halls. Our new Caregiver Credit is designed to help people like this  participant, who worry they'll be penalized when they retire for taking time off to care for a family member. 
Americans are afraid Social Security won‚Äôt provide them with the support they‚Äôll need. And who could blame them when Trump and Republicans in Congress have proposed cutting the program? We're going to protect it once and for all. Read the plan: 
Building on my work in Congress, the plan also protects the program American workers have paid into while increasing its benefits and safeguarding Social Security for future generations by ensuring the wealthiest in this country finally pay their fair share.
The current system is outdated‚Äîand that holds too many Americans back. That's why our plan will also ensure Social Security reflects the diversity of households across the country so we can more effectively support same-sex households and families with multiple breadwinners.
An innovative part of the plan is the Caregiver Credit to reduce the gender and racial gaps that exist in Social Security. It would ensure Americans caring for a child, or a family member who needs help, receive a credit equal to 50% of the avg. earnings of a full-time worker.
Social Security is a sacred trust‚Äîa promise that if you work hard, you‚Äôll be able to retire with dignity. But too many Americans are afraid what they paid in won‚Äôt be there for them‚Äîor won‚Äôt be enough. I'll make strengthening Social Security a priority. 
Looking forward to being on the debate stage Tuesday the 30th! I‚Äôm bringing two supporters with us to Detroit. Pitch in any amount tonight and you‚Äôll be entered to win. 
The same EPA that won't fight climate change refuses to ban a chemical proven to "damage brain development in children." We need an EPA that won't irreversibly harm our children and the planet they will inherit, but will work every day to protect them. 
We don't need to start another war. We need to end the wars we're in. 
Thanks to the workers, union members, ; champions across the country who kept marching, kept fighting, kept sacrificing until the House voted to  today. I'll continue to  alongside you until it becomes law that every working American is paid a living wage. 
Militarizing our border won't make us safe.Walls won't make us safe.Caging kids won't make us safe.Cities like El Paso are the safest in America‚Äînot in spite of the fact that we're cities of immigrants, but because of the fact that we're cities of immigrants. 
We stand with the people of Puerto Rico. Misogyny, homophobia, and disrespect don‚Äôt have a place in any government. Period.
Nos unimos con la comunidad de Puerto Rico. La misoginia, homofobia y falta de respeto no deben de existir en ning√∫n tipo de gobierno. Punto.

These chants don‚Äôt happen by accident. They are the product of a president who sees our diversity not as a strength, but as a weakness. I believe in our country. And I believe, together, not allowing our differences to divide us, we will defeat him and everything he stands for. 
El Paso! I am so proud of this community. Thank you for helping us open our volunteer office tonight and for joining us in a grassroots campaign to win the nomination, defeat Donald Trump, and bring this deeply divided country together so we can meet every challenge we face.

When the president tells four duly elected members of congress to go back to their countries, he isn't just offending our sensibilities with his racism. He is changing the very character of America. And we won't let him. 
Our campaign is powered not by PACs, but by people‚Äîteachers and students, grassroots donors pitching in from across the country. We are so grateful for their support and hope you'll be as inspired by their stories as we've been. 
I have a plan to mobilize every branch of government to end the nationwide assault on reproductive freedom, protect Roe v. Wade, and fully defend the right of women to make their own decisions about their body. 
Trump's gag rule is an attack on women, their health care, and their rights. I stand with in fighting these dangerous efforts. Regardless of income, everyone should have access to reproductive health care‚Äîand that includes abortion.

In the 4 short months since we launched, you raised more than $13 million from nearly 200,000 donors across the US. Not only does that show the power of running a truly grassroots campaign, but it means we've met the DNC's donor requirement for the fall debate. All thanks to you.
In only 90 days, you raised $3,647,729.32. No PACs, just people -- powered by 119,888 contributions at an average of $30. Proud of what we're doing across the country and grateful that you're a part of it.

Acosta, Zinke, Pruitt, Flynn, Bannon, and on and on. Over and over again, Trump appointees have been forced to resign because of corruption, cruelty, and criminal behavior. The only way to end this trend is to replace the person at the top.
Acosta protected a child predator. He had to resign, but he never should have been appointed. Trump knew Acosta‚Äôs history when he nominated him. And the Republican Senate knew it when they confirmed him. We must hold all of them accountable.

Shaundelle's son Akilah was murdered with an AR-15-style rifle while in a Nashville Waffle House. She is honoring him with action, starting a foundation in his name. Yesterday, she asked me what I'd do as president to end gun violence in this country. Here's what I told her: 
You will not intimidate She is strong, she is fearless, and she will never stop fighting for El Paso, the border, and ensuring every single one of our fellow human beings is treated with dignity and respect. We're all better off because of it.

 Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke denounced the Trump administration's controversial "Remain in Mexico" policy for asylum‚Ä¶
"O'Rourke visited Mexico and listened to tearful immigrants say they fled Central American violence and turmoil to seek asylum in the U.S., but were turned away at the border. Later, O'Rourke staged a rally outside the U.S. Border Patrol facility in Clint" 
This is a campaign powered not by PACs, but by people. I am so grateful to everyone who has become a part of our movement; and I hope you chip in one more time before our deadline tonight to show the strength of our people powered campaign. 
We must end the Remain in Mexico policy, end metering, end family separation, and end the detention of those who pose absolutely no threat. But we must go far beyond that and fix the entire system. Earlier this year, I wrote a plan to accomplish this:
The wealthiest, the most powerful country on the face of the planet is turning these families away from a land comprised of refugees and asylum seekers the world over. This can't be us. This can't be America. But right now, it's America and it's on all of us to make this right.
In addition to this administration's inhumane policies, they overturned asylum protections for domestic abuse survivors. That means this mother and her three children are forced to wait for months to even begin the process of petitioning for asylum and having their case heard.
Another mom I met was a victim of domestic violence. She showed me the injuries that she ; her 3 children sustained back home. When she made it our border, she was told to wait in Mexico. She kept telling me how afraid she was but that she just wants to make it okay for her kids.
So he walked much of the 2,000 mile journey with his son on his shoulders. He lost his shoes along the way. Another person traveling with him fell ill and died on the journey -- one of the thousands of asylum seekers to die while trying to come to the U.S. to escape violence.
Spoke with a father from El Salvador who was at work when gang members showed up and demanded he give them ransom or else they'd kill his young son. He went to the police but they responded by telling him it was best for his family to leave because they couldn‚Äôt protect him.
Met a 19-year-old who was separated from her family when they traveled to the border seeking refuge from El Salvador. She has already been waiting in Ju√°rez for 3 months but her court date isn't for another. She has no legal help and doesn't know if she'll see her siblings again.
She had a business in Honduras, a home, and a school her daughter liked. She didn't want to leave -- she had to. She made the decision that I would make it if I were in the same situation with Molly, to come here and seek safety. I think it's what any parent would do.
I spoke with a mom who faced violence, kidnapping, and threats to her 10-year-old's life in Honduras. They traveled atop, not inside of, a train known as La Bestia and fell off on the journey. They've been in Ju√°rez 4 months and don't have their U.S. court appointment until Sept.
I walked across the Paso del Norte bridge and into Mexico this morning to meet with kids and families who came to our country seeking asylum but who have been turned back by this administration's unlawful and inhumane policies. This is who we are keeping out:

There were multiple, systemic efforts by Russia to interfere in our election but Trump calls it a hoax. It‚Äôs because he invited these attacks. It‚Äôs why he obstructed the investigation into them. And it‚Äôs why we need to protect our democracy by beginning impeachment proceedings.
Sitting next to the leader of a country that successfully invaded our democracy, Trump once again refused to stand up for America and instead chose to side with Russia and its dictator, Vladimir Putin.

My plan to fix our democracy and return power to people would end partisan gerrymandering designed to draw people out of their democracy‚Äîand ensure 35 million additional votes are cast in 2024. Read it here: 
We're at risk of becoming a democracy in name only.

 Coming up next:
Tonight, I was on stage for my kids, and for children across this country, including some, their same age, separated from their families, sleeping on concrete floors under tin foil blankets. To do right by them, we need a new kind of politics. 
So join us. Be a part of this campaign.This is our moment. And future generations are counting on us to meet it. 
It‚Äôll take a movement like we led in Texas‚Äîone that renewed our democracy by bringing everyone in and writing no one off.That‚Äôs how we‚Äôll defeat Donald Trump and bring this country together.
To meet the challenges we face, we can‚Äôt take the same old approach. It‚Äôs going to take a new kind of politics‚Äîdriven by the urgency of the next generation: Climate activists fighting for their future, and for everyone‚Äôs. Students marching for their lives, and for all of ours. 
Following the lead of the students marching for their lives, we need to implement universal background checks, pass red flag laws, and keep weapons of war on the battlefield‚Äîso they‚Äôre not trained against our communities in synagogues and churches, concerts and movie theaters. 
In America, no one‚Äîincluding the President‚Äîis above the law. He must be impeached.
Our greatest existential threat is climate change.
Since Trump swore to protect and defend the United States, he has done exactly the opposite‚Äîrelinquishing America‚Äôs role as the leader of the free world, cozying up to dictators, and abandoning our allies.
 In Iowa, has heard firsthand from Milan Underberg, a middle schooler in Newton on how we keep our kids safe in‚Ä¶

Climate change is the greatest threat we face‚Äîand we have one last chance to unleash the ingenuity and political will of hundreds of millions of Americans to meet this moment before it's too late. Here's our plan: 
  on guns: "This effort must be led by the young people...The students from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas changed‚Ä¶
Children should be able to learn without fear of being gunned down in school. All of us should be able to live, without fear of being murdered in our mosques, synagogues, and churches; at movie theaters, in concerts, or on the street. We must end our epidemic of gun violence.
On gun violence, we can either accept this as our fate and fortune‚Äîthat we are somehow inherently evil and dangerous‚Äîor we can acknowledge that this is a human problem with a human solution and act immediately.
Our nation has always welcomed the oppressed, the persecuted, and the hopeful‚Äîbut Trump has defied this aspiration, which is drafted into our Declaration and welded into our Statue of Liberty. We need to do better. Here's our plan: 
 Trump is responsible for these deaths. 
We need to end the federal prohibition on marijuana‚Äîand expunge the records of those incarcerated for low-level drug offenses.
Let's decriminalize marijuana, a drug that's legal in much of the United States‚Äîand turn our attention to executives at companies like Perdue Pharma, who knowingly and deliberately pushed for highly addictive opioid medications to be over-prescribed.
  with the first mention of reproductive freedom in tonight's  also has to mean that every w‚Ä¶
All women should have access to the healthcare they need‚Äîand that includes abortion.
Our healthcare plan, Medicare for America, is the surest way to guarantee universal, high quality healthcare and dramatically reduce out of pocket expenses. 
Medicare for America was inspired by people like Joey from Laredo‚Äîa 27-year-old man who was told he would die by the age of 40 from diabetes and glaucoma, but has only been to the doctor once because he doesn't have health insurance. Took this note when we first heard his story. 
Necesitamos incluir a todos en esta econom√≠a.
That means: 1‚É£ Investing in our schools, so all kids have an equal chance 2‚É£ Investing in healthcare‚Äîso all Americans are well enough to go to work or start a business 3‚É£ Investing in a clean energy future‚Äîconfronting climate change and creating millions of new jobs.
Our economy doesn‚Äôt need $2 trillion tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations. We need durable, sustainable growth, built on real things: innovation, infrastructure, and immigration.
Tonight, you'll hear our vision for a new kind of politics‚Äîpowered by people and driven by the urgency of the next generation. Join us. 
Four years ago, marriage equality became the law of the land thanks to champions fighting day after day. We will honor that victory by committing to achieving full LGBTQ+ rights, signing the Equality Act into law, and ensuring everyone is finally treated with dignity and respect.

Big honor to have Salud‚Äôs endorsement in our campaign to represent and fight for all Americans -- especially our nation‚Äôs veterans and their families. He‚Äôs always been a champion for California and the members of our armed services across the country. 
5‚É£ The plan works to fully honor our veterans by investing in them at home, and ending wars abroad. You can read it here: 
I believe we support our Armed Forces by ensuring our foreign incursions are only a last resort. If politicians want to send our kids, our parents, our neighbors into combat, they should have to explain why every single one of us should bear the costs of war‚Äôs consequences.
4‚É£ I will not only end our wars, but I‚Äôll make it harder politically for Washington to start new ones. We‚Äôll implement a progressive tax to be triggered if a new war is started, exclusively to fund the care of future veterans -- never war itself.
3‚É£ It follows what I‚Äôve long said about stopping war -- that we will cancel the blank check for war, end the AUMF, ; return power to the American people. As president, I will ensure that before this country enters another war, we have exhausted every single peaceful alternative.
2‚É£ This is accomplished by reinvesting nearly $200 billion that will result from ending these wars into directly helping veterans -- improving their health care, resources ; the VA while preventing veteran homelessness and expanding the support offered to them and their families.
1‚É£ My plan finally ends our current forever wars and brings our service members back home to strengthen their communities and receive the highest quality care from the best trained personnel at the best equipped VA facilities.
Yesterday, I released a comprehensive plan to fully support those who put their lives on the line for our country. The single best way I see that we can honor and support our veterans is by not sending them into a needless war, anywhere, in the first place.

We'll also support veterans seeking to improve their employment credentials, own businesses or farms, or avoid crushing student debt. We'll devote resources to preventing veteran homelessness. And we'll expand support offered to veterans as they re-enter their communities.
We'll provide veterans with equal treatment by ensuring women veterans receive care without harassment, LGBTQ+ veterans are honored for their service, and veterans impacted by PTSD or service-related injuries are not unjustly denied benefits for the effects of their injuries.
We'll invest in building a state-of-the-art VA health care system that finally addresses staffing shortages, attracts top medical talent, increases research into diseases that disproportionately impact veterans, and establishes the VA as a leader for mental health care.
We'll end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, cancel the blank check for endless war, and reinvest the savings to ensure every American who put their life on the line for this country can thrive upon their return home.
This country must be willing to pay any price and bear any burden to provide the full care, support, and resources to every single veteran who served every single one of us. My new plan will ensure that we finally do.Take a look:

Instead of making those in our communities afraid of going to work and school, continuing to contribute to our communities and to their full potential, we should not only reverse course on these raids but we should rewrite our immigration laws so they fully reflect our values.
Immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans. Immigrants make our communities safer. When you militarize and terrorize and raid our communities, you make us less safe. People are less likely to report a crime, serve as a witness, and testify in a trial.

Children caring for toddlers in immigrant jails, inadequate food and water for hundreds of kids, and weeks without bathing or clean clothes. They will struggle with this trauma the rest of their lives. We‚Äôll have it on our conscience for the rest of ours. 
Trump's gag rule is an attack on women, health care, ; -- which serves 40% of the 4 million patients under Title X. Regardless of income, everyone should have access to reproductive health care. Fight back by making a donation to Planned Parenthood. 
This administration is gunning for war in Iran. We can resolve our differences with that country firmly and peacefully, without invading yet another country and starting yet another war in the Middle East. 
Listening and learning not just in Iowa but all across this country, it's clear to me that farmers, ranchers, agricultural communities, and rural America need to be at the table and in the driver's seat as we write policies to fight climate change.

Good news for Maine and for our democracy. Now we need to enact automatic and same-day voter registration across the country so every voice is heard and every vote is counted. Our voting rights plan would make that happen. 
We are going to fix our democracy and return power to people. 
On Juneteenth and every single day, we are committed to doing the work necessary to secure equity, justice, and civil rights for all. 
154 years after Juneteenth, the work is still unfinished. The march continues. The fight for justice, equity, and full civil rights goes on. 
In Los Angeles, we discussed how our immigration plan would create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people and make naturalization easier for 9 million eligible immigrants. We will put an end to this administration‚Äôs cruel policies that create chaos in our communities. 
Grateful for the dedicated labor leaders who joined us this morning in Los Angeles for a discussion on immigration, health care, ensuring we fully support public school educators, and strengthening unions across the country who continue to fight for the rights of workers. 
We should be doing everything possible to strengthen the clean air rules for power plants so we can cut pollution, improve the quality of our air and water, and fight climate change before it‚Äôs too late. My administration will. 
On Juneteenth, we're celebrating a powerful moment in history. But it's a moment whose promise is not yet realized as we fail to address a legacy of slavery, segregation, and suppression that is alive in this country. The fight for true freedom, justice, and equity must go on. 
Donald Trump just launched his re-election campaign. It's going to take all of us working together to defeat him. Make a donation tonight and join us in building a grassroots campaign that will do just that. 
"O'Rourke started his intro on the topic of veterans. His support for teachers, reproductive rights, and the need to engage young voters all received applause. He also touched on climate change and the need to dismantle gerrymandering ; voter suppression." 
Mike in Aurora, CO sent in a question about my plan to increase aid to Northern Triangle countries. Our goal is to address the root causes of migration. He asked: ‚ÄúHow do we make sure corruption within those governments [doesn't] siphon the aid we are providing?‚Äù 
I am committed to ensuring that we raise the minimum wage so that it is a living wage, achieve equal pay, ban discrimination in the workplace, and finally ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in this country. 
 Militarizing and raiding our communities makes us less, not more, safe.
"A busy day for Beto -- 4 stops between Spartanburg and Greenville, talking about equality and the environment among other platforms. He shared his thoughts on education, telling voters he'll make sure public schools are fully funded. O'Rourke is making S.C. a priority." 
"O‚ÄôRourke spoke on issues ranging from health care to prison overpopulation. He previously has called for the end of private, for-profit prisons; decriminalizing marijuana and universal healthcare."
Make no mistake: Trump is promising to repeal the ACA, taking health care away from millions. We stopped him before. Now we must do it again. Let's defeat him and ensure that every American has access to universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care.
We must never again take another child from another parent as they seek asylum, and we must reunite every family that has been separated so far by this administration's cruel and inhumane practices. Thanks to for continuing to speak up and keeping the pressure on.

I unveiled a proposal to create 200,000 new small businesses, unlock half a trillion dollars of economic opportunity for women and minority owned businesses, and expand access to capital while rooting out institutional racism, sexism, ; bias.Take a look: 
"O'Rourke called for a living wage for teachers, saying that better pay for them is crucial to the success of children and the success of the United States. O'Rourke also said better access to health care is a must for everyone." 
Good news for VA. Now we need independent redistricting commissions that finally end gerrymandering across the U.S. where elected officials pick their voters instead of the other way around, drawing people out of their democracy based on race ; ethnicity. 
4 years after the Mother Emanuel shooting tragically took 9 lives in Charleston, we were in SC to honor them with action. We are committed to continuing the work necessary to finally end hate crimes and gun violence in our places of worship, our communities, and our country. 
To permanently reshape the justice system, we must not just end the prohibition of marijuana and expunge the records of those arrested for possession but we must end cash bail, prisons for profit, mandatory minimums, ; the schoolhouse to jailhouse pipeline. As president, I will.
Too many fathers are unjustly away from their kids today because of a failed war on drugs waged disproportionately on communities of color, a cash bail system that punishes people for being poor, and a private prison industry funded by needlessly putting more people behind bars.
It has been seven years since President Obama implemented DACA. We must honor the incalculable contributions Dreamers are making to our communities and to our country by freeing them from any fear of deportation and making them U.S. citizens.
Today, I want Ulysses, Molly, and Henry to understand what their Mom and Dad are trying to do for them at this moment of truth for their country and their future. I hope that in their own ways, they carry the tradition forward.Happy Father's Day. 
Such a great way to end an amazing return to South Carolina. Big thanks to everyone who joined us in Greenville this afternoon and across the state over the past three days. Looking forward to being back again soon.

Grateful for the opportunity to join Rev. Dr. Keith McDaniel Sr. and the congregation of Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church for a Father‚Äôs Day service this morning. 
If we bring every American into their country and this democracy, we will realize our true greatness. We will finally have a system of justice that is just, a world-class public school system led by public school teachers, economic justice, and health care that is a human right. 
Started a beautiful Sunday morning with a donut discussion in Spartanburg. Our thanks to Senator Reese for hosting us, for bringing everyone together, and for introducing us to the community as we continue to show up everywhere, for everyone, every single day.

At tonight‚Äôs Columbia town hall, we talked about fighting to ensure that we finally have equity and opportunity in every part of this country including in education, health care, our democracy, the economy, and the justice system. 
Our fourth event of the day brought us to Sumter for an energizing town hall. Grateful for everyone who joined the discussion, shared their ideas, and stepped up to help us build this grassroots campaign across South Carolina and throughout our country. 
At today‚Äôs Sumter town hall, we discussed our voting rights plan and how it will:‚úÖEnact automatic ; same-day registration‚úÖBan PAC contributions‚úÖEnd gerrymandering‚úÖExpand the Voting Rights Act‚úÖMake Election Day a holiday‚úÖRegister 50 million voters‚úÖIncrease turnout 
Appreciate the veterans who joined me for a discussion in Sumter as they continue serving by advocating for those who they served alongside. We're going to fully invest in veteran resources and care. That's a promise this country must keep, and under my administration, we will. 
We must spare no resource in serving every single veteran who served every single one of us.

 Speaking at Black Alliance presidential forum, Beto mentions his new plan to expand access to credit for minorities and mino‚Ä¶
I'm committed to continuing this work and to leveraging the full force of the federal government to expand access to capital and root out institutional racism, sexism, and bias in the small business lending market. Read the full plan here:
In Congress, I voted for legislation to ensure minority ; women owned businesses had a seat at the table in the government when it came to cracking down on discrimination and to make it easier for small business owners ; entrepreneurs to access capital and navigate the tax code.
In 1999, I started a small business in El Paso that brought dozens of high-wage, high-skilled jobs to the border community. It helps me understand the day-to-day challenges small business owners face -- and those challenges are only amplified for women and communities of color.
Finally, my plan calls for shifting $100 billion in government contracts away from large corporations and to small businesses. Half of that opportunity will go to minority and women owned businesses. 
I will triple the federal government‚Äôs investment in the Minority Business Development Agency to ensure more entrepreneurs can access mentorship and resources to navigate the challenges of owning a business. 
We will root out racism and discrimination in the small business lending market so every business owner, no matter where they live or their background, can get that first loan to start their business or that capital investment to hire additional employees. 
The plan will spur the development of 200,000 new women and minority owned small businesses by the end of my second term. 
But these same entrepreneurs are locked out of the exact resources and capital they need to start their businesses, grow them, and create more jobs. My new plan will unlock half a trillion dollars in opportunity for women and minority owned businesses. 
Minority and women owned businesses have been the fastest growing businesses across the country for the past decade. These entrepreneurs helped pull our economy out of the Great Recession. They are staples of our communities, country, and economy. 
Our country has a wealth gap where the median white household is worth 10x that of the median black household. It's unjust, unacceptable ; holding every single one of our communities back from reaching its full potential. Small businesses are no exception. 
To ensure this country can live up to its full potential, we must confront the fact that we have an economy that works too well for too few and not at all for too many. At the  I announced a plan that does just that. Read it here:
While visiting the Gullah Geechee Nation, we discussed the need to confront the legacy and consequences of slavery, segregation, and the continuing suppression of our fellow Americans. It‚Äôs how we will begin to repair the damage done and prevent these injustices moving forward. 
Grateful for the powerful discussion in North Charleston this morning about fixing a justice system that is patently unjust. We are committed to continuing the urgent work necessary to secure equity, opportunity, justice, and full civil rights for everyone in this country.

Excited to have Chrystian joining our team and leading the effort to bring more people into their democracy as we ensure every voice is heard. 
Really looking forward to the first democratic debate on Wednesday the 26th. The challenges we face are the greatest in living memory but we have a big, bold, ambitious, forward-looking vision to share that will bring this country together to overcome every single one of them.
Climate change is the greatest threat we face. And we won't solve it with half measures or only half the country. It will take all of us. That‚Äôs why I announced an historic, ambitious plan to meet this challenge and invest in our communities. 
Thank you, Your leadership, advocacy, and courage in telling your story will ensure this country gets veterans the care they need, and finally talks about the impact these endless wars are having on yet another generation of Americans. 
We need universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care so every person in this country can see a doctor, afford their prescriptions, and get the care they need to live to their full potential. 
Transgender women of color have been targeted, attacked, and murdered across this country. If we don't urgently confront this reality, then we can't correct it. We have a plan to directly address this crisis:

 What makes Beto run? This morning it's Pride and fighting prejudice 
We're running a true grassroots campaign focused on people and the big, bold, ambitious things we want to achieve together. 
We cannot allow religious freedom to be used as a guise for discrimination. We must stand against this in Puerto Rico and we must reverse the Trump administration‚Äôs continued efforts to exacerbate LGBTQ discrimination everywhere.Here's our plan: 
You don't get kids in cages and "human dog pounds" at the border until you have described asylum-seekers as animals or an infestation, dehumanizing them in the eyes of their fellow human beings.

The census directly determines our representation and political power. Trump is once again using intimidation and fear to draw people out of their democracy. As president, I‚Äôll protect the accuracy of our census and make sure every voice is heard.
"Beto O'Rourke released a new LGBTQ+ Equality plan Wednesday. He says he would appoint judges and executive branch officials, including openly LGBTQ+ appointees, who have a demonstrated record of supporting the full civil rights of every single person."

"Beto O'Rourke says tariffs are hurting farmers who are already struggling with flooding. The former Texas Congressman held a town hall in Clinton and said farmers are paying the price of the ongoing trade dispute. O'Rourke also talked about climate change." 
Last week, I released a¬†voting rights plan to register 50 million new voters by 2024. That work must start immediately. That‚Äôs why we just released a voter registration toolkit to give every person the resources to register new voters in their communities. 
Count me in, I held monthly town halls each year I was in Congress ; weekly town halls while serving on the City Council. Just had our 83rd event in Iowa and we've held 150+ town halls across the country over the last three months. Looking forward to the next! 
"O'Rourke says tariffs are hurting farmers that are already struggling with flooding. He says farmers are paying the price of ongoing trade disputes. He called it crippling to those who have lost crops to flooding or who haven't been able to plant at all." 
Every vote must count and every voice must be heard. That's why we announced a set of bold proposals to bring tens of millions more of our fellow Americans into their democracy. See the plan here:  
"Roughly 100 potential constituents packed a Gateway Area Community Center classroom to hear O'Rourke speak. He highlighted his intent to tackle gun violence. The former Texas congressman is also placing emphasis on voters' rights in America."
I was able to write, introduce, pass, and have signed into law a bill that expands access to mental health care for veterans. It was possible because I showed up to listen and learn at town hall meetings. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre going everywhere and bringing everyone into this campaign. 
Really enjoyed spending the morning with everyone in Clinton! 
I don‚Äôt listen to the NRA or the gun lobby. I listen to people, and they‚Äôve made it clear we need universal background checks without exception, to stop selling weapons of war into our communities, to implement red flag laws, and to fully fund research on ending gun violence. 
Peggy told us that this was the first town hall she had ever been to. Very grateful that she joined us this morning in Clinton. 
Ban all PAC contributions to campaigns and finally return power to people in our democracy.

We need to sign into law the Equality Act to ensure full civil rights for LGBTQ+ Americans across the country. We must also support organizations like who are on the frontlines, fighting for equality. Today as we celebrate, consider donating: 
This past year, the legislature passed a bill that would prevent public insurance, including Medicaid, from covering the cost of gender reassignment surgery. This is an effort to endanger and devalue the lives of transgender Iowans and we cannot accept it.
In a few minutes Amy ; I are going to run the Capital City Pride 5K here in Des Moines as we celebrate Iowa‚Äôs 10th anniversary of marriage equality. We‚Äôre inspired by these victories for the LGBTQ+ community and our country, but we know there‚Äôs still a lot of work to do.
From hiring slowdowns to billions of dollars in losses, this president's disastrous approach to trade has already hurt farmers and the markets so many of them worked a lifetime to establish.
The damage of Trump's reckless trade policies and tariffs has already been done. What we see is yet another example of him trying to be both the arsonist who created this problem in the first place and the firefighter who wants credit for addressing it. 
I heard about the urgent need to expand voting rights during each of our four previous trips across Iowa. So we put together a plan to do exactly that while also fixing our democracy and bringing more people into it. Today, I had the chance to share our plan in Knoxville.

The disastrous tariffs Trump has levied have an impact. So do these trade wars he‚Äôs carelessly entered us into. Farmers, manufacturers, entire communities of Americans across this country are being hurt and are paying the price. 
As we  today, the work to end gun violence continues. The work to keep our kids ; communities safe goes on. But remembering those who have succumbed to our inaction, we‚Äôll deliver on solutions to ensure we finally and fully address gun violence.

We created a bold plan to expand voting rights because we believe every person should be able to participate in their democracy, every voice should be heard, and every vote should be counted. Here's what's at stake:

A conversation in Atlanta focused on justice and how we confront the legacy of slavery, segregation, suppression ‚Äî how people have been kept down based on their race and ethnicity. It‚Äôs the only way that we‚Äôll repair the damage done and keep from repeating these injustices again. 
"In Atlanta, Beto O'Rourke held a town hall where he talked about voter suppression. O'Rourke also talked about economic inequality and why voting in every election from school board to president is important." 
Students in New Hampshire told us about state legislatures across the country blocking voting rights and suppressing the vote -- successfully keeping people out of their democracy. So with their help, we wrote a plan to fix this. 
The sacrifice of the Allied heroes who went to battle in Normandy not only saved the soul of humanity but continues to be a lasting example of what's possible when we lead and work together for our shared values, principles, and goals. Forever grateful. 
As president, I will make sure every single American is empowered to vote‚Äîand that those who have historically been drawn out of our democracy are able to make their voices heard so this country can live up to its full promise and potential.See the plan:

I joined Meet the Press yesterday to share our innovative plan to end Trump's disastrous policies at the border and finally rewrite our immigration laws so they reflect our values, the reality on the ground, and the best interests of our communities. 
"Taz Al-Michael, an University of Oklahoma junior, said meeting with O‚ÄôRourke and discussing issues facing Oklahomans was exciting, especially because Democratic presidential candidates have tended to overlook Oklahoma."
Finally, I will establish a first-of-its-kind community-based visa category so communities can welcome LGBTQ refugees through community sponsorship of visas. You can find more details and see additional steps here: 
Fourth, I will ensure transparency and accountability in law enforcement, including ICE and CBP. I will create an independent Border Oversight Commission and mandate a uniform process for tracking and preventing deaths at the border.
Third, Johana was held at a private ICE facility where the incentive is profit and not security or the well-being of our fellow human beings. I will eliminate all funding for private, for-profit prison operators.
Second, I will issue an executive order to require detention only for those with criminal backgrounds representing a danger to our communities. We know that these asylum seekers and refugees are harmless kids and families who don‚Äôt need to be locked away.
As President, here are some immediate steps I will take:First, I will ensure lawful and humane conditions at our immigration facilities. That means access to medical treatment, mental health care, social workers, and translators. These deaths are preventable.
This administration failed Johana. It failed Roxsana. It is failing transgender women of color across America. We must ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect ‚Äî those in our care and those in our communities. These inhumane conditions must end.

"O'Rourke was back in Texas and immigration was his focus. He heard from immigration attorneys, activists, and DACA recipients. His new plan includes a path to citizenship for 11 million people, ends work on the border wall, rescinds travel bans, and reunites separated families." 
Texas imported $107 billion in goods form Mexico last year.Our farmers, manufacturers, businesses sent $110 billion in goods to Mexico. If we don‚Äôt stop these new tariffs, the tax on Texas alone would be $27 billion. But no state would be spared.
"Beto O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs broad immigration plan would have a direct positive effect on hundreds of people who call New Hampshire home." Here's how: 
We need the facts, the truth, full accountability, and real justice for what happened to our country in 2016. We need to do the right thing for our democracy and we need to do it now. Congress should begin impeachment proceedings. 
"O'Rourke would end the separation of immigrant families at the border, remove federal immigration courts from their current jurisdiction under the Justice Department and stop all funding for private, for-profit prison operators. He also addresses DACA." 
Instead of locking up kids ; families who are seeking asylum, we can connect them with case managers through the Family Case Management Program. It'll do a better job helping them follow our laws and it costs a tenth of the price.That's part of our plan:  
Just more manufactured chaos and confusion from this president. Don‚Äôt need more tariffs or more reckless policies. We need immigration laws that match our values and we need a president who understands the border.
Hope you‚Äôll tune in now on as we talk about Trump and the need for overcoming a generation of inaction to pass immigration reform.

Remembering all of those who made the ultimate sacrifice protecting us, our nation, the values we stand for at home and abroad. We honor them. We hold their families in our thoughts. And we recommit to making the country they gave their lives for better each and every single day.
Let‚Äôs end these love affairs with dictators and strongmen. Now, it‚Äôs siding with Kim over someone who's dedicated his life to public service for this country. But it's also Putin and MbS. Duterte and el-Sisi. As Trump does this, he turns his back on us, our democracy, our allies.
When we connected families seeking asylum with case managers through the Family Case Management Program, 100% of them attended their court hearings. In other words, we did a better job helping them follow our laws and it cost us a tenth of what we pay to keep them locked up.

Congratulations to on the honor. We're proud. But those of us who know him aren't surprised -- his leadership, on the ground work to achieve progress across S.C., and transformational victories on affordable housing make him a national leader we can all count on. 
We need to promote democracy here at home, making sure that every single vote counts and everyone is able to vote. And then abroad, we must make sure we send the signal that the future of this world is a democratic one, not an autocratic one. Under my administration, we will. 
Let's rewrite our immigration laws in our own image. Let's reflect our values, our reality, the best interests ; traditions of this country that is comprised of immigrants, asylum-seekers, ; refugees. I know that we can do it. Today's news makes it all the more urgent that we do.
We must stop this. And in a democracy, it's on all of us to do so. We must never again separate another family when they come here at their most vulnerable and desperate moment. We must make every effort and spare no expense to reunite families who have already been separated.
Manufacturing a crisis through a series of lies -- refusing to follow our own asylum laws, not allowing asylum seekers to lawfully petition at our ports of entry, sending troops to the border, putting children in desert tent camps, and locking kids under a bridge in El Paso.
Separating children from their mothers and fathers then peddling lies about how many remain apart, the number of parents who have been deported without knowing where their kids are, and the sum of children who they've lost track of altogether.
Putting kids in cages and continuing to lie about how many remain there. Lying about their health and their care. Lying again and again about when or even if they'll be released.
This is only the most recent lie from a president and an administration who continue to inflict suffering, death, and irreversible trauma with the most inhumane and un-American immigration policies. At the expense of our humanity, not to the benefit of our safety.
I am calling for an immediate and complete investigation into not only her death under our care but into why we're just now learning about it. There must be accountability, there must be transparency, and there must be justice.
On Monday, I said a fifth young asylum seeker had died under our care. But we've just learned that they were actually the sixth. A 10-year-old girl died in U.S. custody back in September and her death was hidden from us for nearly eight months. A cover up.
Last night, we outlined 6 ways to reform the justice system:1‚É£End a war on drugs that has become a war on people2‚É£End the prohibition on marijuana3‚É£Expunge the records of those locked away for possessing it4‚É£Eliminate private prisons5‚É£End mandatory minimums6‚É£End cash bail 
As president, I will listen to, partner with, and invest in rural communities and those who grow the food and fiber that feeds and clothes us all. No community will be written off or taken for granted, and no American will be forgotten.
Farmers in Iowa and across America are bearing the brunt of this president's disastrous trade war. And these tariffs he's imposing are destroying the markets so many of them worked a lifetime to establish. We need to have an urgent response to this. Here's mine:

Beto's bold climate plan mobilizes $5 trillion ‚Äî spurred by the largest investment towards fighting climate change in history ‚Äî and guarantees we achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 while getting halfway there by 2030.  
If we believe in justice for all, then we must reform our justice system so it is equitable for all.  
At a  Beto outlined how the greatest threat we face is climate change. We have one last chance to unleash the ingenuity and political will of hundreds of millions of Americans to meet this moment before it's too late. Here‚Äôs our plan:  
We‚Äôre going to make sure that every single American has access to universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care ‚Äî without exception.  
Eliminate private prisons.  
Beto wants to achieve guaranteed, universal, high-quality health care for every person in this country so that everyone can see a doctor, afford their prescriptions, and get the care they need to live to their full potential. 
Beto adds that he will also confront the true legacy of slavery, of segregation and suppression, of how people have been criminalized and marginalized based on their race and ethnicity. 
Beto wants to reform our justice system by ending the federal prohibition on marijuana, expunging the records of those arrested solely for possession, eliminating private prisons, ending cash bail, ending the use of mandatory minimums, ; providing meaningful reentry. 
Beto shares that we will not solve the opioid crisis through the criminal justice system. Instead, we will rise to meet this challenge through a commitment to, and investment in, public health. We're finally going to hold the pharmaceutical corporations accountable. 
Let‚Äôs not only honor our asylum laws and never again take another child from another parent at their most desperate and vulnerable moment, but let's guarantee that all separated families are reunited. Then we will rewrite our immigration laws in our own image.  
At our  Beto just shared how he'd work each and every single day to end gun violence in our communities and this country. Watch here: 
For too long, women have been leading this fight, shouldering the burden of making sure their reproductive rights are protected. It‚Äôs time that all of us join them in this fight. 
Beto believes that we need universal background checks without exception. We need to stop selling weapons of war into our communities, implement red flag laws, and fully fund research on ending gun violence. 
We need a president who will do absolutely everything in their power to defend the right to choose. Add your name to support our comprehensive plan to guarantee safe and legal abortion access.

 Beto O‚ÄôRourke: Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd stop gun violence [Opinion] 
We're meeting Americans across the country who are having to work a second or third job just to make ends meet. It's clear that we have an economy that works too well for too few and not at all for too many. Let's finally achieve a minimum wage that is a living wage for everyone.

Let's strengthen our unions, protect collective bargaining, and guarantee that one job is enough by paying every working American a true living wage. We stand with organized labor in Iowa and across the country. 
And as president, I will only nominate judges who respect, affirm, and defend Brown v. Board. Andrew Oldham doesn't get nominated. Neither does Wendy Vitter. If you don't believe in civil rights, in equity, in opportunity, you don't belong in a position of public trust.
We will also decriminalize truancy. States like Texas have taken the first step by repealing laws that prosecute children for truancy, but the fines their parents face still loom large in a system that disproportionately targets black and brown students. I will take this on.
It continues by finally achieving universal pre-k for every three and four-year-old, securing affordable childcare, signing into law paid family leave, and ensuring our country's minimum wage is a living wage so no parent has to work a second or third job to make ends meet.
But I am committed to meeting this challenge with everything we've got. It starts by increasing public school funding for low-income and underserved communities, guaranteeing the equitable distribution of resources, and ensuring teachers reflect the diversity of this country.
The work continues when we see shameful race-based disparities in HS graduation rates, in who can access higher education or skills training, and in who earns a degree. Happening as we fail to invest equitable resources in education and fail to make higher education affordable.
The work continues when in that same kindergarten classroom, children of color are five times more likely to be disciplined, suspended, or expelled as a white child -- impacting their opportunity and potential. A school to prison pipeline in full effect at five years old.
The work continues when we see an unconscionable achievement gap in our classrooms that is already in full force on the very first day of kindergarten -- where black children are already 10 months behind in math and 12 months behind in reading compared to their white classmates.
Brown v. Board was decided 65 years ago but our fight for equality is not over. The work to ensure we have equity and full opportunity in our classrooms, our schools, and our education system must continue. 
Our thanks to the advocates, activists, and LGBTQ champions across the country who lead the way each day, kept the march for justice going year after year, and ultimately passed the Equality Act in the House today. Together, we will secure full civil rights for LGBTQ Americans.
 ‚ÄúHealth care is fundamental to anything else that we want to be able to do."At our  made a comp‚Ä¶
Repeal the Hyde Amendment. 
Our country has the world‚Äôs largest prison population. It is comprised disproportionately of people of color, built by targeting and prosecuting some communities for nonviolent drug offenses and not others. We need real, lasting, meaningful justice reform. The time to act is now. 
Ultimately, this is about ensuring that every single one of us ‚Äî regardless of race, ethnicity, or class ‚Äî can live to our full potential with equal rights and equal dignity. We will build a future that is more just, more fair, and more prosperous for every single person.
Finally, we provide meaningful reentry reforms to help reduce recidivism. That starts by banning the box on job applications, returning drivers licenses, allowing access to loans that can unlock skills trainings, and ensuring their constitutional right to vote is protected.
It also means taking on prosecutorial and police misconduct with a fully-staffed Department of Justice that can conduct investigations, provide de-escalation trainings across police agencies, and institute community-based review boards to ensure accountability and transparency.
Fifth, we ensure that all people are given an equal opportunity to have their rights respected by our legal system. This means reopening the federal Office of Access to Justice, launched to provide greater resources for indigent litigants in civil, criminal, and tribal courts.
Let‚Äôs end the use of cash bail once and for all and provide states grants to replace these systems. I also support decriminalizing truancy in a flawed system that disproportionately targets black and brown students.
Fourth, we finally disrupt the cycles of poverty that trap people in a criminal justice system where they do not belong. On any given day, nearly half a million people are in jail ‚Äî many for misdemeanors ‚Äî because they cannot afford to post bail.
Third, we eliminate private, for-profit prisons. No place in our society for a multibillion-dollar industry that profits off human suffering. We will not continue to outsource imprisonment to corporations that have a perverse profit incentive to put more people behind bars.
Second, we stop using mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenses ‚Äî a practice that costs us dearly in both a loss of human potential and a prison budget that has nearly doubled in the past two decades. We must begin treating addiction like the public health concern it is.
First, we end a failed war on drugs that has long been a war on people, waged on some more than others. We must end the federal prohibition on marijuana and expunge the records of those who were locked away for possessing it.
Across the country, students, activists, and advocates are laying bare this history and leading the way forward. Because of their efforts and the civil rights heroes before them, I believe we have the opportunity to rebuild our justice system.This is how I propose we do it:
If we are to end mass incarceration, we must confront the fact that every arm of the system is shaped by this legacy ‚Äî from the over-policing of black and brown neighborhoods, to a process marked by unequal resources, to prisons that set people up for failure rather than reentry.
It's a prison population perpetuated by a school-to-prison pipeline that starts as early as kindergarten, where a black child is 5x as likely to be suspended or expelled as a white child. Many have joined Michelle Alexander in calling this the New Jim Crow, and for good reason.
It's shameful that our country has the world‚Äôs largest prison population. One comprised disproportionately of people of color; built on prosecuting some communities for nonviolent drug offenses ; not others, even as people of all races use illegal drugs at roughly the same rate.
I published a essay this morning that not only confronts a justice system that is patently unjust -- continuing the legacy of slavery and suppression to criminalize people of color -- but also outlines urgent steps to reform it. Take a look:
A 2-year-old has died, the 4th child seeking asylum to die in our care in 6 months. End the suffering, the trauma, the death at our border. Treat immigrants and asylum seekers like human beings. Focus on the wellbeing of these kids above any other concern. 
At a time of unprecedented attacks on women and their health care, we must protect Roe v. Wade and defend a woman‚Äôs right to make her own decisions about her body. 
It's unconscionable for even one veteran to be left behind. We're going to serve every veteran who served every single one of us. We're going to invest in their education, job training, housing, mental ; physical health care. That's a promise this country must keep, and we will.
Our efforts made more veterans eligible for mental health services but new reporting shows the VA has done little to spread the word and ensure these veterans get this lifesaving care. It's unacceptable. We know what's wrong, we know how to fix it, and now we need the VA to act.
In the midst of a suicide crisis that claims the lives of more than 20 veterans a day (14 of whom hadn't accessed the VA), I worked with members of both parties to write, pass, and sign into law legislation that expanded access to mental health care for veterans.
This country doesn't spare resources in sending young women and men to fight in endless wars. We shouldn't allow it to spare resources investing in them when they come home. We need to do everything in our power to serve those who served our country. 
Universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care must be achieved as quickly and as surely as possible so everyone can see a doctor, afford their prescriptions, and live to their full potential. 
We will fight these dangerous efforts with everything we‚Äôve got in legislatures across the country, in the courts, and at the ballot box. We will win. Take action now by supporting organizations like that provide critical health care to millions. 
HB 314 is not only unconstitutional - it's a radical attack on women across Alabama and America. We won't back down when it comes to fully protecting Roe v. Wade, fighting dangerous efforts to roll back reproductive health care and defending a woman‚Äôs right to access an abortion.

Let us forever free Dreamers from any fear of deportation by making them citizens, bring their parents and millions more out of the shadows, honor our asylum laws, never again take another child from another parent, and reunite every family that has been separated so far. 
In 2018, we forever changed voting in Texas. Now, our work continues so every American is able to fully participate in our democracy. We need a new Voting Rights Act that ends gerrymandering, gets big money out of politics, and institutes automatic ; same-day voter registration. 
Let‚Äôs support rural America by listening to and partnering with rural communities to invest in hospitals. Expand Medicaid in those states that haven't. Take power from the hands of insurance companies and return it to people with universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care.
More than 100 of the country‚Äôs remote hospitals have closed in the past decade. 1 in 5 of the rural hospitals that remain open are at a high risk of closing too. We've seen the impact and urgency of this crisis firsthand in Texas and too many other states.
We have an economy that works too well for too few and not at all for far too many. Let's increase opportunity by achieving: ‚úÖ Equal Pay‚úÖ Paid family leave‚úÖ Universal Pre-K‚úÖ Affordable childcare‚úÖ $15 minimum wage ‚úÖ Universal health care‚úÖ The Equal Rights Amendment

Started tonight's town hall by talking about gun violence because it's been on all of our minds after another school shooting, another kid murdered, another community forever impacted. As parents and as Americans, we've got to act now to end this. Here are some things we must do: 
In Salem, we talked about why we‚Äôre fully committed to running a true grassroots campaign that does not accept a dime from PACS, corporations, special interests, or federal lobbyists. 
In Salem, we‚Äôre talking about our commitment to forever freeing Dreamers from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens. 
Back in New Hampshire and excited to have Amy on the road with us! 
Still thinking about the town hall we had last night in Minneapolis. A powerful, necessary discussion on ensuring we have equity and opportunity in every part of our country including in our institutions of education, health care, the ballot box, economy, and justice system. 
‚ÄúO‚ÄôRourke greeted every person who stood in the rain and walked into the taproom soaking wet. He made his presidential pitch to voters, telling a capacity crowd that he would work to fix the immigration and health care systems and address gun violence.‚Äù 
Let's celebrate Teacher Appreciation Week by fighting for educators, their classrooms, ; our public schools. Pay them a living wage so they don't have to work a second job, invest in their success, protect their retirement ; ensure they can teach to the student and not the test.

‚ÄúSeveral hundred jammed the cafeteria at Edison H.S. in northeast Minneapolis as O‚ÄôRourke spoke about immigration, health care, the economy, climate change, gun violence and other issues, sprinkling his remarks with Spanish. He‚Äôll be back, he added.‚Äù 
At a time of unprecedented attacks on reproductive health care, we must defend a woman‚Äôs right to make her own decisions about her own body. That means defeating dangerous efforts like Georgia‚Äôs HB481, protecting Roe v. Wade, and expanding access to reproductive health care.
We can either continue to accept gun violence in our schools, our places of worship, our streets, and our communities or we can urgently act with human solutions to this human-caused crisis. I‚Äôm fully with those I met in Minnesota who are choosing action. Some of our ideas:

‚ÄúSpeaking with students at Berg Middle School, O‚ÄôRourke said as president, he would push for universal background checks to help reduce gun violence. O‚ÄôRourke said he is also in favor of banning the sale of assault weapons to civilians.‚Äù 
Big thanks to Andrew for committing to caucus with us after our Wartburg College town hall in Waverly this afternoon. Honored to have your support. 
‚ÄúIn Waverly, O‚ÄôRourke talked a considerable amount about ending the so-called ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù by ending marijuana prohibition, expunging the records of those convicted of possession, ending the cash-bail system and eliminating for-profit prisons.‚Äù 
Yesterday, a 14-year-old told me she was afraid that she would be shot in her classroom. Today, students in Highlands Ranch were shot in theirs. We are not doing enough to protect the lives in our lives. We must take action now to stop gun violence in our communities. Some ideas: 
‚ÄúO‚ÄôRourke is bringing groundwork devotion to Iowa on his trail to the 2020 election. From minimum wage and higher education to climate change, he made a point to relate the nation‚Äôs issues and his ideas to people he has connected with in Iowa.‚Äù 
Our government is captured, corroded, and corrupted by special interests like never before. It‚Äôs why I introduced the No PAC Act, why we want to restore power to people, and why we are rejecting all money from PACs, corporations, federal lobbyists, and special interests. 
Thanks to Bryce and Kale for hosting a town hall for the community at their home in Adel. Really enjoyed meeting everyone. 
Immediately re-open the investigation into Sandra Bland's arrest and death. There must be full accountability and justice. 
In Boone, we talked about the need to confront the true legacy of slavery, of segregation, of suppression, of Jim Crow, of how people have been criminalized and kept down based on their race and ethnicity. This truth is critical to change, progress, equity and justice for all. 
 The Boone County Iowa Democrats welcome to Boone this morning! 
‚ÄúO‚ÄôRourke opened with immigration, guaranteeing universal health care, making sure women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, raising minimum wage to $15, and emphasizing the importance of unions. He has been to 30 different colleges.‚Äù 
From Adel to Boone for our second town hall of the morning. Thanks for the welcome. 
If we want to achieve an economic democracy in this country then we must have a minimum wage that is a living wage, paid family leave, and equal pay for women. We must also ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and always put people before corporations, PACs, and special interests.

The greatest threat we face is climate change. The stakes are clear. The time to act is running out. We have to do everything we can to overcome this challenge and we have to do it now. Take a look at our four-part plan to fight climate change: 
I have signed the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge. Here's why: 
Very saddened that yet another child has died in U.S. custody after traveling hundreds of miles to seek refuge and asylum. We must focus on the wellbeing of these children above any other concern. If we sacrifice humanity for security, we'll lose both. 
Barr has failed in his responsibility to our country. He is not fit to serve as Attorney General and should resign.
"In a wide-ranging address that touched on most every major policy dispute confronting the country, the White House hopeful talked about returning America to a place that celebrates diversity and makes education and healthcare a priority for everyone." 
"O'Rourke talked climate change ‚Äî the subject of his $5 trillion proposal Monday ‚Äî and homelessness, the Equal Rights Amendment and immigration, education and structural racism, health care and gun control. He began in Spanish ‚Äî speaking fluently." 
Today we observe Yom HaShoah to remember the Holocaust. But after attacks on our Jewish neighbors in Poway, in Pittsburgh, in too many more communities across the country, we must also take this moment to join together and fight anti-Semitism and hatred everywhere we see it.
I stand with the South Carolina educators who are speaking up, organizing, and marching to the Statehouse today. We must pay our teachers a living wage, get them the resources they need, and fully invest in their classrooms. This can‚Äôt wait any longer.
My thoughts are with the UNC Charlotte community during this painful and difficult moment. We must act now to prevent gun violence by following the lead of the young people marching, the moms demanding action and advocates across the country who refuse to live in fear any longer.
"This policy was put together as the candidate has been touring the country. It's informed by the people he meets and by the questions he gets. Whether it's in Iowa, Nevada, or California, you can see that O'Rourke has been absorbing this information."MSNBC on our climate plan: 
‚ÄúThe proposal lays out a four-pronged approach: 1) executive action, 2) mobilizing $5 trillion to invest in a clean energy transition, 3) guaranteeing net-zero emissions by 2050, and 4) preparing vulnerable communities for the impacts of climate change.‚Äù

The president‚Äôs actions are an incitement to violence against Rep. Omar and Muslim Americans across the country. There is a cost and consequence to this rhetoric. Members of both parties must stand together and condemn the president's dangerous actions.

Have plans this weekend? We're going to be knocking on doors across the country as we continue to hit the ground running. It's going to take all of us talking to voters in all 50 states to build a winning grassroots campaign. Find a canvass near you here:  
Our diversity is our strength. Proud of Houston and communities across Texas for being the example at a time when some would want us to be defined and divided by our differences. 
Whether a synagogue shooting or mosques ; black churches burning to the ground, we must confront the hatred, racism, Islamophobia ; anti-Semitism growing in our country. We'll support one another. We'll rebuild. And we'll recommit to combatting the rise of hate crimes in America. 
See you Friday, Bluffton!
Why is Congress voting to make it harder ; more expensive for Americans to do their taxes? Follow the money. Special interests, PACs, ; corporations continue to purchase legislation like this. It's time to put people over PACs, country over corporations. 
Looking forward to being back in South Carolina on Friday for a three-day visit to the state. Hope to see you at one of our town halls. 
"O'Rourke's relentless campaign carried over into his second trip to Iowa. The former congressman made 6 stops in the Des Moines metro Saturday. His 12-hour day began and ended in Des Moines ‚Äî after roughly 6 hours of stump speeches and voter questions." 
Our thoughts are with the families of the three service members killed today in Afghanistan.
"O‚ÄôRourke called for a united front among parties in order to find solutions to large-scale problems such as immigration and climate change while laying out ideas for how he will address education debt, health care, and voting rights."

Huge honor to sit down with the incredibly talented Art Cullen, Tom Cullen ; the team at the Storm Lake Times. Their unwavering commitment to elevating the community, to telling its story, to ensuring no one is left out or left behind makes me proud. Not the enemy of the people. 
Whether focused on public education or immigration or climate change or health care or investing in rural America, the ideas leading this campaign are coming from town hall meetings in communities across Iowa and our country. This morning, at Better Day Cafe in Storm Lake. 
"O'Rourke spoke for one hour, with more than half that time devoted to answering 12 questions. He began with an impassioned discussion about the need to stem climate change through renewable energy, then shifted to education funding and health care" 
Good morning from Storm Lake. On our way to Better Day Cafe for a town hall. Hope to see you there or later today in:‚û°Ô∏èFort Dodge at 12 (1 Triton Circle)‚û°Ô∏èMarshalltown at 3:30 (Mowry Irvine Mansion)‚û°Ô∏èGrinnell at 5:30 (Drake Library)Everyone is welcome.

"His ambitious, progressive agenda included promoting greater voter participation by ending gerrymandering...He would also end the prohibition of marijuana and curb the school-to-prison pipeline that severely impacts communities of color."

There's nothing wrong in this country that we can't make right with the people of this country. Thankful for the leadership coming from Houston, Harris County, and Texas. 
As president, I will sign into law a new Voting Rights Act. Together, we will end gerrymandering, we will get big money out of politics, we will have automatic and same-day voter registration, and we will ensure racist voter ID laws never again impact access to the ballot box. 
With El Paso and the communities of the border leading the way, we are going to rewrite this country's immigration laws in our own image, reflecting our own values, and in the best traditions of the United States of America. 
Let's adopt universal background checks. No more loopholes, no more exceptions. And then let's ensure that weapons of war are kept on the battlefield and are no longer sold into our communities where they show up in our schools, our churches, our workplaces, and our streets. 
This is a campaign for America, for everyone in America. The challenges we face cannot be met by half measures or with only half the country. It‚Äôs gonna take all we‚Äôve got and it‚Äôs gonna take all of us.

We have an economy that works too well for too few and not at all for too many more. We're going to change that. We're going to finally have an economy that works for everyone. 
We are going to achieve guaranteed, high-quality, universal healthcare. Everyone able to see a doctor, afford their prescriptions, and get the help they need. No one denied care, no one priced out, no one left behind. 
Thank you, El Paso! Very grateful for today and every day in this beautiful community. 
Let's fully invest in a pre-K-12 world-class public school system. Let's pay our teachers a living wage. Let's end the school to prison pipeline and achieve equity in our classrooms. Once we do that, there's no stopping these kids and no stopping this country. 
If we believe in justice for all, then we must reform our justice system so it is equitable for all.

Together, as one country united, we can fulfill the promise of America, to ourselves, to each other, and to every generation that succeeds us.
I am honored to run to serve you as President of the United States; and I am grateful to each one of you who will join this campaign and commit yourself in service to this great country of ours.
Our ability to campaign this way as a campaign run for ; by people - no PACs, no corporations - people from every state ; territory ‚Äî can bring us together not just in defeating Trump, but in ensuring that we have the full power of people to accomplish this country‚Äôs priorities.
Let us be clear: we will not be defined by our fears or the smallness of our differences; we will instead be known by our ambitions, our aspirations and the resolve, the creativity, the service and sacrifice by which we will have achieved them.
El exito de este pais depende en el exito de cada persona en este pais.
Pero tambi√©n necesitamos una econom√≠a donde todos pueden participar, y tener un prospecto de √©xito independiente de su genero, de su raza, de los cuantas generaciones su familia tiene a dentro o aparte de los estados unidos.
Si queremos enfrentar los retos de cuidado de salud por todos; de la reforma migratoria; del cambio clim√°tico ‚Äînecesitamos una democracia en que cada persona puede votar y ofrecer su voz.
The unprecedented concentration of wealth, power and privilege in the United States must be broken apart. Opportunity must be fully shared with all. We must all have the opportunity to succeed. Together. As one country.
Let us also acknowledge that any hope of full political democracy must be premised on an unwavering pursuit of economic democracy. Every child must see a future for themselves in this country.
So every citizen must be able to cast their vote, have their voice heard. We must sign into law a new voting rights act, we must forever banish big money from our politics, end gerrymandering, and enact same day voter registration in every part of the country.
But if we want to do any of this ‚Äî let us agree that our success as a country is based on the success of this democracy, the greatest mechanism devised to bring forth the power of people.
This country can and must once again take its place as the indispensable leading nation, doing what no other country can, for ourselves and for the world.
And when we talk about combatting climate change, it is important that this work ensures that every American benefits, including those poor and minority communities that have so often borne the brunt of climate change.
We have an opportunity now to meet an existential threat to this planet by ensuring that public health policy, economic policy, and the engine of a far more conscientious capitalism is put to work in service of our ability to meet this challenge of climate change.
Let us organize this country around a historic effort to free this economy from a dependence on greenhouse gas emissions, invest in the technologies and jobs in renewable energy that will speed this transition, and reassert our international leadership before it is too late.
And if the wars we are already in don't have a definition of victory or strategy to win them and bring these service members back home to their families and their communities, we must put an end to them.
Let us not only ensure that we meet every single part of our obligation to our veterans but that we also make sure that before we enter yet another war that we have exhausted every single peaceful alternative.
And if we‚Äôre serious about security, let this country of immigrants - republicans, independents and democrats  - rewrite our immigration laws in our own image, from our own experiences, and in the best traditions of this great country.
Let‚Äôs ensure our security not through walls and militarization, but by investing in our ports of entry where the vast majority of everything and everyone that ever comes into this country first enters.
Let‚Äôs not only honor our asylum laws and never again take another child from another parent at their most desperate and vulnerable moment, but guarantee that all separated families are reunited.
Let‚Äôs bring millions more of our fellow Americans out of the shadows and on to a path to contribute even more to our country‚Äôs success.
If we believe that this country‚Äôs success is premised on the fact that immigrants and asylum seekers from the world over have found a home here, then let us forever free Dreamers from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens.
Let‚Äôs end cash bail, private prisons, and the war on drugs. Let's confront the true legacy of slavery, of segregation, suppression, of how people have been criminalized ; kept down based on their race and ethnicity. Only that truth will allow us to begin to repair the damage done
If we believe in real justice reform in the face of the largest prison population on the face of the planet ‚Äî one disproportionately comprised of people of color ‚Äî let us not just end the prohibition of marijuana but expunge the record of those arrested solely for possession.
Let‚Äôs ensure everyone can succeed regardless of their family dynamics, their gender, their sexual orientation or their race. Paid family leave. Equal pay for women. No discrimination in the workplace, and access to capital for communities that have been shut out for generations.
Let‚Äôs support rural America by listening to and partnering with rural communities on infrastructure, schools, hospitals, ; broadband. Let‚Äôs make sure farmers can make a profit while they grow the food ; fiber that feeds and clothes not just this country, but so much of the world.
Let‚Äôs not diminish the power of unions in this country. Let's strengthen unions in this country and ensure a path to apprenticeships and careers. Guarantee that one job is enough by paying every working American a true living wage.
Let‚Äôs graduate young women and men from high school who are career ready as well as college ready, able to pursue debt-free higher education or a job that provides purpose and a real paycheck. We can do this.
If we believe in an economy that works for all, then let us invest in a world class Pre-k through 12 public education system and ensure that we are paying our educators a living wage so that they don‚Äôt have to work a second or third job.
This means every one of us is able to afford our prescriptions, see a doctor, take our children to a therapist. No one priced out. No one denied care. No one left behind. Universal, guaranteed, high quality health care must be achieved as quickly and as surely as possible.
Universal healthcare means everyone gets primary healthcare, mental healthcare ‚Äî and universal care also means that every woman makes her own decisions about her own body.
If we believe in universal, guaranteed, high quality healthcare - because we see the consequences to our fellow Americans who go without - then let us come together around a solution.
These challenges and the threats to our democracy cannot be met by half measures or with only half the country. It‚Äôs gonna take all we‚Äôve got and it‚Äôs gonna take all of us.
The differences between us ‚Äî where we live, who we love, to whom we pray, how long our families have been in this country, the color of our skin, the party to which we belong ‚Äî those differences cannot be allowed to define us or divide us now. Let us be Americans first.
A vigorous democracy - both economic and political - is the only check on the inertia of power, on the corruption and capture of our institutions, and the only means to elevate the voices and lives of our fellow Americans.
Unrestrained, money and influence have warped this country‚Äôs priorities and its very democracy. It has corrupted our democracy. It has invited cynicism, distrust and disengagement from Americans who see a government in thrall to those who can pay for access and outcomes.
For too long in this country, the powerful have maintained their privilege at the expense of the powerless. They have employed fear and division ‚Äî based on differences in race or ethnicity, geography and faith ‚Äî to keep us apart, and angry and afraid of one another.
The challenges before us are the biggest of our lifetimes. Millions without healthcare; an economy that works too well for too few and not at all for too many; ; the opportunity to avert the worst consequences of climate change fading in the face of our inaction. We must overcome
Like so many of you, Amy and I have decided that at this moment of truth we must give it our all. This moment is our test - the generations that follow ours, the people of the future, are counting on us - and we cannot be found wanting.
This is a campaign for America. For everyone in America. No one written off, no one taken for granted.
It is here, from my hometown of El Paso, that I officially launch this campaign to serve you as the next President of the United States of America.

We will define ourselves by what we want to accomplish for America. Take our survey to tell Beto how you think we can move this country forward.

We launched this grassroots campaign seven days ago. In the time since, we've brought our fellow Americans together for dozens of town halls in six states. Yesterday, it was in New Hampshire. Here's a recap: 
"Whether it's being mobbed by students on the Plymouth State University campus or delivering a stump speech in Claremont, it's clear that O'Rourke's newly minted presidential campaign will fuel itself on a message of bridging the partisan divide." 
Visiting each one of the 10 counties of New Hampshire over the last two days left us inspired, hopeful, and excited to return soon. Thanks for putting in the miles and being part of this campaign.

 Beto - in the white shirt - leading a ‚ÄúWe are!‚Äù ‚ÄúPenn State‚Äù chant in a huge crowd at PSU 
 After his meet and greet event, around to meet with people at the HUB, first leading a ‚ÄúWe Are‚Äù chant 
The complete focus of this campaign will always be on the people of this country. Never on PACs, corporations, or special interests. 
Nothing like some Penn State dairy to start off the morning in the Happy Valley. 
We need to show up everywhere, listen, learn, and bring this deeply divided, highly polarized country together around the big challenges before us. That's what this road trip continues to be all about. 
Late night on the road to Penn State. Hope you'll join us tomorrow morning at 10:00 in the HUB (16802 Pollock Road). Looking forward to seeing everyone soon!

 Thanks for coming all the way to Cleveland, Beto O‚ÄôRourke 
Impressed w/ David Green, UAW 1112 president. His leadership, the way he's fought for employees at GM's Lordstown plant ; how he's conducted himself while being attacked by the President. He's fighting not just for his members but for their families, this community ; all workers. 
Incredible town hall in Detroit this afternoon. A powerful, necessary discussion on ensuring we have equity and opportunity in every part of our communities and country including in our institutions of education, health care, the economy, and the justice system. 
Sam asked if we're going to be nice to one another. The antidote to what we see in politics today is not more meanness, pettiness, smallness, and hatred. It is treating one another with civility and decency, and staying focused on the big things we want to accomplish together. 
With innovative skills training, hands-on certification programs and career readiness paths, the Detroit Carpenter Apprenticeship School is a model for the country. Proud of their work connecting students and graduates directly to jobs in the community. Appreciate the discussion.

Grateful for the time that Ray Defenbaugh took this morning to share his insights about ethanol and bring people together for an early Friday morning discussion in West Burlington. 
We don't back down in the face of Islamophobia and racism at home or abroad. We stand up, stand together and make it clear that terrorism won't be met with indifference but with action that honors our diversity as the people of the world. Thinking of our friends in New Zealand.
An unforgettable first day in Iowa. Thank you to Keokuk, Fort Madison, Burlington, and Muscatine for the welcome, the inspiration, the reminder why we're all doing this together.

Black History Month is a reminder that our greatest achievements flow from ensuring the greatest opportunity for all. A reminder that when we boldly confront injustice where we find it, we can speed this country‚Äôs journey towards equity and justice. 
From a bridge in Selma to the floor of the U.S. House, John Lewis has never stopped marching in order to make our country a more equitable, just, and perfect union. Happy birthday to a true American hero.

Our country must be defined not by our smallness, our fears, or our paranoia but by our personal stories, the courage of our convictions, and the big, bold, ambitious things we want to achieve together.

Such a powerful conversation with an inspiring group of students at Grateful for the welcome and an unforgettable visit. 
Monday night was a celebration of what makes El Paso so special. The fact that this community is one of the safest cities in America, not in spite of but because we're a city of immigrants. 
We don't need an emergency declaration, troops deployed, or additional border walls and fencing at a time of record safety and security along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Proud to see all of the members participating in advocacy day at our state capitol. Always inspired by those we met throughout Texas who were telling their stories, making their voices heard, creating change, and holding those in positions of public trust accountable. 
Big thanks to the Border Network for Human Rights, the talented musicians, and the more than 50 groups who helped us organize as we shared the truth about the border and celebrated our binational community. 
Very very proud of this community. We are the example that the United States of America needs right now.

The eyes of the country are on El Paso. And we're going to tell our story. Join us Monday evening. 
If immigrants are good for the country, the border is secure and walls end lives instead of saving them, then why does the president try to scare us about immigrants and the border and take our land to build a wall we don‚Äôt need?  

‚Äî EL PASO CALLING ‚ÄîCome one, come all!  A bold, confident, ambitious message for the country from the U.S. - Mexico border. *** JOIN US ***Monday 5pm at Bowie High School ‚Äî 801 S San Marcial St. in El Paso, TX, USA. 
This cynical rhetoric of war, of invasions, of fear ‚Äî totally disconnected from the truth ‚Äî has led us to treat our fellow humans in the most inhumane way. And it hasn‚Äôt made us safer. We thought we could sacrifice some of our humanity for security, we risk losing both.
Not only that, but walls and militarization of the border have resulted in the deaths of thousands of migrants, including children. We are pushing desperate families to cross in ever more hostile terrain. We are ensuring greater suffering and death.
And, by the way, none of this stuff has worked. As the border became more militarized, and deadlier, immigrants stopped returning to their home countries. In effect, this policy actually increased the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.
‚ÄúYet, Mexicans nonetheless bore the brunt of the deportation campaign launched in the name of the war on terrorism, comprising 72 percent of those removed in 2009.‚Äù
‚ÄúWith the passage of the Patriot act in late 2001, the number of deportations increased again and reached nearly 400,000 in 2009. None of the terrorist attacks involved Mexicans, and none of the terrorists entered through Mexico...all came to the united States on legal visas.‚Äù
We‚Äôve conflated the war on terror, the war on drugs, with immigration. This has led to mass deportations ; militarization at a time of record safety on the U.S. border. False fear is cynically stoked to harm those who pose no threat to this country. 
Our government built a border fence in El Paso in 2008, a misguided response to 9/11 (no terrorists have crossed the southern border and attacked this country). It didn‚Äôt make us any safer. In fact crime in El Paso increased after it was built.  
 It wasn't true when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it in 2018, it wasn't true when AG Ken Paxton said it in January and it sti‚Ä¶
There's a reason Texas has historically been a nonvoting state. Those in power try really hard to keep people out of their democracy. That's why we need to protect and enhance voting rights.
