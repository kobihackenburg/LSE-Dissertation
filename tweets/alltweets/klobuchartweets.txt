Today I voted for the bipartisan  Iran War Powers Resolution to make it clear: the President doesn‚Äôt have the authority to start a war with Iran. He must come to Congress for before using military force against Iran. My friend showed tremendous leadership ; it passed.
We are surging, our campaign is gaining momentum every day, and we want you to join us! Help us build the strongest coalition to defeat Donald Trump. Apply for open positions at our headquarters and across the country here: 
America deserves a President who doesn't give up or give in just because a decision is hard.America deserves a President who is as resilient as her people. 
We‚Äôre lucky to have you in this fight, Your work on our team is invaluable and your story is an inspiration to us all. 
 Democracy only works when our voices are heard. I‚Äôm committed to making sure all of our diverse communities are part of my administration. Thank you for hosting this! 
 We must match our education system to the economy. Nearly half of AAPI post-secondary students are enrolled in community college, ; some of our fastest growing jobs require one- ; two-year degrees. As President, I'll make one- ; two-year community college free.
 Universal background checks, assault weapons ban, magazine limits, passing my bill to close the boyfriend loophole (preventing people who have abused dating partners from buying or owning firearms): we can get this done. Read more of my plan here: 
 We'll put a stop to the mean-spirited approach to immigration from this administration. It hurts our communities, families, economy and our country. As President, I will pass comprehensive immigration reform because immigrants don‚Äôt diminish America ‚Äî they are America. 
 Government services must be accessible to all Americans. Period. That means increasing outreach to immigrant communities, upholding and strengthening language access mandates, and improving the use of interpreters and translated materials. 
 And we must address the disparities that are holding too many AAPI families and communities back -- and that means investing in health care, education, childcare and housing. 
 We have to do more to make sure AAPI data is disaggregated ; promote an accurate Census. While some are faring well within the AAPI community, others are experiencing poverty rates much higher than the national average. 
 There must be a seat at the table for the NHPI community. As President I'll make sure the NHPI community is involved in federal policy-making (taking advice as I always do from my good friend We can't make decisions on issues important to you without your input.
As President, I'll nominate talented people to lead my administration who represent the diversity of America, including from the AAPI community. And I will make sure we are consulting with the AAPI community on all matters of federal policy. Your voice must be heard.  
In a few minutes I‚Äôll be joining ; for the AAPI Twitter town hall! You can follow along using the hashtag

I stand with and let's be clear: attacks on the union are unacceptable. I come from a family of proud union members and I know when unions are strong, America is strong.

If you don't have witnesses, you do not have a fair trial. The truth will come out.
Went back into the impeachment trial just seeing the Iowa endorsement, now I‚Äôm stepping off the floor seeing this from New Hampshire‚Äôs to have the endorsement and the focus on bringing our country together. 
Honored today to get the endorsement of the Iowa City Press-Citizen! Amy Klobuchar endorsed for Iowa Caucus by Press-Citizen Editorial Board 
I met this young woman in Iowa. After our event, we spoke and she thanked me for working on lowering the cost of insulin. America deserves a President who will take on Big Pharma, not one who breaks promises, and I will lead this fight. 
Heading back to the impeachment hearing. Lots of rumors about the schedule going into next week.  I have a job to do and I hope the people of Iowa and beyond will understand that my experience matters. Being in the arena matters. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.
Throughout his campaign my friend John Delaney focused on economic solutions for our country. Going forward he is in a unique place to make the case for long term economic policies that will help everyone. I look forward to seeing him and April soon. 
The recent outbreak of coronavirus is a stark reminder of the persistent threats posed by infectious diseases. As President, I will make sure that the United States continues to lead the global fight to prevent, detect and respond to pandemics.Read more:
This is why I was the Dem lead on a bill signed into law this yr to help farmers stay in business when bankruptcy hits. This is also why we need a new President. Am on ag committee ; have 12 years of experience working on rural issues. That matters.

There are more than 400 bills on Mitch McConnell‚Äôs desk. Bills on everything from climate change, to gun safety, to prescription drug prices. If we want progress in 2020, we need to build a coalition strong enough to flip the Senate and send Mitch McConnell packing.
After Donald Trump signed the GOP tax bill, he went to Mar-a-Lago and told his friends ‚ÄúYou all just got a lot richer.‚ÄùAs President, I want to come back to places like Mount Pleasant, Iowa and say ‚ÄúI just gave you a decent retirement and childcare for your kids.‚Äù

Our country was founded on the idea that we are an independent democracy.If you say that a President can do anything they want just to further their election and it doesn't matter, you have a king. You have no democracy.

Since joined our team in June, 16 other Iowa legislators have supported my candidacy for President ‚Äî the most of anyone in the field.These leaders know the hard work of governing is bringing people together to get things done. I‚Äôm proud to have their support. 
Tonight, I asked what possible reason there could be for allowing witnesses in a judicial impeachment trial and allowing none for the President‚Äôs trial. There is none.
I was on the committee for the last impeachment trial in the Senate. During that time we heard from 26 witnesses, 17 of whom didn‚Äôt testify in the House, and we ultimately removed Judge Thomas Porteous.
We are facing a critical moment for our democracy. This election is not about who has the most political ads or money. It is about who is the best candidate with good ideas, and maybe you don‚Äôt agree with every single one of them, but also who is the candidate who can win. 
My plea to Senate Republicans: no matter how you're going to vote on impeachment, you can't stop the truth. Our job is not to serve at the pleasure of the President. Our job is to answer to the power of the people. 
‚ÄúAlthough we differ on particular policy positions, we agree that our common goals for the country outweigh our differences.‚ÄùWhat unites us is so much stronger than what divides us. We‚Äôre building a big coalition and we're going to defeat Donald Trump.  
Democrats won in Louisiana, Kentucky, Wisconsin ; Michigan because candidates reflected their states.When we run on bold ideas like an education system that matches our economy and respects the dignity of work, we win.I will lead the ticket, win big and defeat Donald Trump. 
I will never forget meeting Janice Weiner for the first time.She‚Äôs right ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhen one person is ill, it doesn‚Äôt just impact that person. It engulfs an entire family.‚ÄùTogether, we will lead from the heart, combat addiction and prioritize mental health.

As I said in Nevada, we need a big coalition to defeat Donald Trump. I‚Äôve won every race I've run (in a purple state) by double-digit margins because I bring people with me.A candidate at the top of the ticket should do just that ‚Äî not shut them out.
We can cross the river of our divides as a country, but to do that we have to build bridges. Here's what I'd do as President: 
There is a lot of talk today about if a woman can beat Donald Trump.  As I said on the debate stage, Nancy Pelosi does it every day.  Our campaign is on the rise. Join us at

We need to use this moment to work with our allies to de-escalate this conflict and ensure the safety of our servicemembers and Americans in the region. 
We must work with our allies to de-escalate the situation while ensuring the safety of Americans in the region.
As we await the casualty assessment from tonight‚Äôs attacks, it is vital that we take this moment to consider any response. A full-blown war with Iran is not in the national security interest of the U.S. or allies in the region.

Even Richard Nixon allowed his top people to come forward and speak. Why would President Trump be blocking his top people from telling the truth?John Bolton must testify.
The President should be focused on preventing the situation from escalating and taking all steps to protect U.S. personnel and our allies in the region - not sending inflammatory tweets.
Threatening to target cultural sites anywhere is beneath the values of the United States and should be beneath the dignity of any President - but not this one.
It was great to meet you in New Hampshire, Joe! 
Iran‚Äôs moving forward with a nuclear weapon is a direct result of feckless foreign policy decisions by the President, like taking us out of the landmark Nuclear agreement. The world is much less safe but oh it must feel good to say it at his rallies.  
No they are not: Trump claims his tweets are sufficient notice to Congress that U.S. may strike Iran

As President, I will lead the movement to automatically register every young person in this country to vote when they turn eighteen, fight back against gerrymandering, and build an agenda of economic opportunity. 
We need someone heading up the ticket that has been able to show that they can gather the support of moderate Republicans, Independents, as well as our fired up Democratic base.I have done it three times. I know how to win big. 
As I said in the debate, the President is not king; the law is. Americans deserve a President who will look out for working people and protect our democracy. I will be that President.
We need a leader who can bring people together. If you are tired of the extremes in our politics, the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. If you want a bigger tent and a wider coalition and longer coattails, join me ‚Äî we will

The way I look at it: if you want to cross a river over some troubled waters, you build a bridge, you don‚Äôt blow one up. And I think that we should build on the Affordable Care Act. 
I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time. That is why I favor a public option, which is a nonprofit option, and yes it does bring the cost down immediately for 13 million people and then we‚Äôll expand coverage to 12 million people. 
I would be so proud to be the first woman President ‚Äî but more than that, I want to be a President who gets things done and improves people's lives.  
What I see on this stage: Sen Warren's work on the CFPB, Vice President Biden‚Äôs work on getting funding for cancer research, Sen Sanders' work on the Veterans bill. I see what I‚Äôve done ‚Äî passed 100+ bills ‚Äî including three farm bills. That matters.

This is outrageous. Betsy DeVos is denying justice to over 200K students defrauded by for-profit colleges, making excuses for deceptive business practices instead of fixing problems. As President, my Education Dept will work FOR students, not against them.

This opioid crisis killed hundreds of thousands of Americans ‚Äî and is taking lives to this day. We must hold those who caused it accountable. 
Donald Trump has created a crisis of trust in our institutions and in our government ‚Äî not just here at home, but with our allies, too. As President, I will repair relations with our allies and show that America stands with them and against tyrants. 
All you have to do is read this to see why I‚Äôm focused on election security ; passing my bills for back-up paper ballots ; systematic audits. As Fiona Hill said, Russia is ‚Äúgearing up.‚Äù  And that‚Äôs just one possibility.  via

If we hadn‚Äôt flipped the House in 2018, Republicans would control the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. Who would hold this administration accountable?  Who would defend our democracy? Elections matter. We can't afford to screw this up.

This defense is just plain weird: the administration was too stupid to pull off an illegal act? I don‚Äôt buy it. The American people don‚Äôt either.
My grandpa, my mom, my dad ‚Äî they were all labor union members. Americans know that when unions are strong, our country is strong. And when I am president, I will look out for the workers of this country. 
This is not surprising but a big deal all the same....
The Coalition of Southern NH Democrats understands that we‚Äôve got to  in 2020 and we‚Äôll do that by bringing people with us. Thanks for having me at the Blue Moon Rising Gala in Derry. Great to see friends like Amb. Jim Smith ; Janet Breslin-Smith ; meet some new ones too!

I released 12 years of my taxes for this campaign (and didn‚Äôt even need a federal appeals court to make me do it!). It‚Äôs time to see Donald Trump‚Äôs tax returns and hold him accountable.
WHILE YOU WERE TWEETING...The President tweeted 75 times this weekend. Meanwhile, farm bankruptcies up 24%, drug prices way too high, CA burning ; more gun violence. How about a ‚òéÔ∏è to Mitch McConnell instead to pass the House-passed bills sitting on his desk? I have the number.
We will miss Robin Stone, Iowa‚Äôs Delaware County Democratic party chair. She fought to the end, but she also fought for others by making the case for the ACA and health care protections. Know that her daughter will carry on the fight.

NEW reports that Lt Col Vindman testified that key words and phrases are missing from the rough transcript of Trump‚Äôs call with the president of Ukraine ‚Äî and that his attempts to fix it were blocked. The Administration can't cover this up ‚Äî we need to get all the facts.
In the Senate, I've passed legislation to help avoid drug shortages and lead the efforts to increase pharma competition, and as President, I‚Äôll fight to make sure children ‚Äî and all patients ‚Äî have access to lifesaving drugs.
Lt Col Vindman is decorated veteran of the Iraq War, a top national security expert, and a patriot. These attacks against him because of his place of birth go against everything that our country stands for.
Rep. John Walker was a civil rights pioneer. His passing is a loss to the legal and political communities throughout Arkansas.

Congratulations to Dr. Anisa Ibrahim! Her story encapsulates what most of us already know: immigrants and refugees strengthen America.

Trump today on abandoning our Kurdish allies: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got a lot of sand over there, so there‚Äôs a lot of sand that they can play with.‚Äù  ... And I‚Äôm still waiting for him to tell me how this makes America great again. Oh, that‚Äôs right, it helps Russia.  
Nobody in this race wants to protect billionaires ‚Äî not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

Across the country, people are looking for someone to end the chaos of this administration and unite us with an optimistic economic agenda. I'm traveling throughout Ohio this weekend to talk about how we can bring people with us and win big in 2020.
No sanctions after the fact will stop this.  None.  No rallies or chants or tweets will bring back dead children.  This President should never have allowed this to happen and it must be stopped.

The President is sending a message to our allies that the United States is willing to abandon them at any moment, destroying our credibility at every turn. He is betraying our Kurdish partners who have led the fight against ISIS. This is no way to lead.

I visited the REG Biorefinery Plant in Newton, IA today. Trump admin has been handing out these waivers to Big Oil like candy and selling out our rural communities for far too long. We need to support our local and regional economies instead of oil cartels in the Middle East. 
If true, this is yet another major offense. Imagine if all this energy that‚Äôs being used for his personal gain was instead directed towards making economic gains for our country.
A Trump-appointed CIA counsel reportedly made a criminal referral based on the whistleblower complaint. Why did the DOJ not start an investigation? We need to know.

Here we have it ‚Äî another smoking gun. This administration must be held accountable.
In many parts of our economy, this trade war is already showing its devastating impact ‚Äî last month was the worst for American manufacturing in more than a decade. 
President Trump doesn‚Äôt get credit for offering a vague promise to try to undo the damage he has done to biofuels and the rural economy. Even if the President could be counted on to follow through on a promise, I believe it will end up being far too little, far too late.

The whistleblower complaint makes clear that the President repeatedly asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections and then the White House tried to cover it up. The President is abusing his power and shredding the Constitution.
As I said last night to on This shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats have an obligation to uphold the rule of law. A president can‚Äôt sell out our country for his own personal gain.

Trump‚Äôs policies ; appointments (both judges ; cabinet) have hurt workers. So when things go wrong he looks for someone to blame instead of fixing it. I won‚Äôt make promises I can‚Äôt keep ; I‚Äôll get things done. That‚Äôs what I shared w/ the

Honored to be a part of the 143rd annual Stump event at Galivants Ferry in South Carolina! We started with bluegrass music and folk dancing (as is tradition). Then I shared our campaign's message with the 1000+ people here: that there is far more that unites us than divides us. 
This is one of the reasons I wrote Justice Dept ; WH counsel today asking them to provide documents ; all undisclosed information. Like Sen. Coons, I also forwarded name to FBI last year. The White House directed that investigation from beginning to end.

President Trump is treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. And if we are not careful he‚Äôs going to bankrupt this country.  
There are three gun safety bills sitting on Mitch McConnell‚Äôs doorstep that we could pass right now, including my bill to close the boyfriend loophole. We need to send him a message to stop blocking this legislation ‚Äî it‚Äôs a matter of life and death.

I believe if we‚Äôre going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit. Someone who‚Äôs not just going to change the policies but change the tone in the country, and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart. 
Day 4, 5 ; 6: I'll work on sweeping legislation with Congress and local governments. And on Day 7 you're supposed to rest ‚Äî but I won't. 
We need to tackle the climate crisis. Day 1: I will enter the United States back into the International Climate Change Agreement. Day 2 ; 3? I'll reinstate the clean power rules and gas mileage standards.

On Mitch McConnell‚Äôs desk are three bills: universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole, and my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don‚Äôt get deadly weapons. If you want action now, we have to send the message to Mitch McConnell.  
I've been leading the effort to close the Boyfriend Loophole, which would keep guns out of the hands of abusers. This is a critical step to keeping people safe. 
 
The First Step Act was a start in addressing criminal justice reform, but it's time for the Second Step Act. Nearly 90% of incarcerated people are in state and local facilities ‚Äî we have to take action now 
That means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance. That's in four years. I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea.

I want to change the tone of our politics. We need a president with an optimistic economic agenda to move our country forward.
Hunters, Republican voters and now CEOs want gun safety laws. Hey, Republicans in Congress and White House, does the NRA trump over 90 percent of America? CEOs implore Congress to pass stronger gun control laws. 
Proud of my Iowa State Director Lauren Dillon for leading There‚Äôs a record-breaking number of women running for President and our teams are blazing trails on the ground too.

People are seeing the effects of climate change in their own backyards, in their fields and on their farms. The cost of this climate crisis is being felt across the country and is why we must act now. 
When it comes to tackling climate change, we need a strong voice from the Heartland. Because this isn‚Äôt just about the rising sea levels ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the floods, fires, and tornadoes. If we are going to lead this fight, we need to bring the whole country with us.

 Right now Pam Johnson (former pres. of National Corn Growers Assocation) and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack‚Ä¶
Proud to have received the endorsement of  , one of many Iowans whose homes were flooded out this spring. As a country we can no longer ignore decaying infrastructure and climate change.  
This is just the beginning.  More companies profited off of people‚Äôs addiction and they must pay for treatment. 
The FEC has long been gridlocked and ineffective and it needs to be restructured. I have legislation to do it. You can‚Äôt have a functioning democracy with no one to enforce the campaign rules.  via 
In rural communities in New Hampshire and around the country, the effects of climate change are being felt right now. So we need to act right now. 
Toured Stonewall Farm  /education center this morning in Keene, NH. Met w/ leaders ; residents to discuss climate change's impact in rural communities. Thanks State Sen Kahn  and fmr. State Sen Kelly  for joining me ; your activism!

Thanks for visiting the Minnesota State Fair Bernie and next time you‚Äôve got to try the cheese curds.... 
The American people are tired of the President‚Äôs whining ‚Äî we need a president who leads. I have a track record of bringing together Democrats, Independents and Republicans to get things done ‚Äî and that's what we need to do to win. 
Thank you to Helen Honorow for your support and hosting this beautiful party here in Nashua, NH. I especially enjoyed getting to stand next to Helen‚Äôs RBG action figure, who, as Helen said, gives us courage and motivation to take on anything. 
Met with Granite Staters at the beautiful Seacoast Science Center  in Rye, NH with State Senator and former Speaker of the NH State House to discuss our rising sea levels. Climate change is happening now ‚Äî we can‚Äôt wait to take action.

Thanks for asking Paul!  Everyone can tune in on at 2 pm ET to join me at a house party hosted by Helen Honorow in Nashua, NH!  
A year ago today, we lost my friend John McCain. He was a combat veteran, a POW, a Congressman, a Senator, and a presidential candidate who reminded us that we can treat each other with civility and kindness, even when we disagree. He was truly an American hero.
Was on with Chris Wallace this morning: Presidential candidate Klobuchar talks US-China trade war and her plans for the economy |

I shared this message with the  last night: We must come together as a party, because what unites us is so much stronger than what divides us. 
Mattie, who lost her son to gun violence, says it best -- we will pass gun reform "With or without you, Mitch McConnell." Thank you Mattie, Ruth, and for leading this fight. 
Abigail joined me at the  and we watched the carving of the new Princess Kay of the Milky Way (her name's Amy, too!) 
A strong Democratic Party means success at all levels of government. As President, I will work with to strengthen our State Parties and ensure they have the support they need. Together, we will move our country forward from the ground up.

At the DFL MN fair booth...stop by! Our daughter Abigail and her friend Marie casting their soybeans at the DFL booth at the Minnesota State Fair.  Due to Donald Trump‚Äôs policies, there are sadly a lot of soybeans piling up in our country. Remember to use one to vote!‚Äù 
Thanks to Glen Stubbe for this great photo from the Fair.  What was supposed to be some hand shaking at our booth turned into something else!  Thanks to Lt. Gov. for helping out and when the State Fair said no mics we just spoke louder! 
Now there‚Äôs a unique seed-based portrait for the ages. Last year it hung in the State Fair‚Äôs horticulture building...it needs a new home and I have a few ideas!

This is what we mean by the Great Minnesota Get-Together!  
My favorite day of the year ‚Äî the first day of the Great Minnesota Get Together! Love to see all the early risers (Hey there ; and meet the state fair staff on this gorgeous Minnesota morning.

Definition of a Whiner-In-Chief: A President, who instead of tackling the economy and the challenges of our nation, blames Barack Obama, the press, Jewish Democratic voters, immigrants, Baltimore, and, oh yes, the Prime Minister of Denmark üá©üá∞ for the chaos he has wrought.
Governor made the climate crisis the centerpiece of his campaign and our nation is better because of it. Thank you for the bold ideas you brought to this race Governor.
When unions are strong, our economy is strong. Like Senator Paul Wellstone said, "We all do better when we all do better." Great to be at the convention today! 
What do many of these mass murderers have in common? A history of violence and hatred towards women. We must close the boyfriend loophole and prevent domestic abusers from buying deadly weapons. And we can do it now. 
We live in a democracy and no one owes you a vote. This is unacceptable.
One call from the NRA is all it takes....how about a president who isn‚Äôt afraid of them?  via 
The President has now managed to alienate Denmark. Did not see that one coming. 
From my days as county attorney to my years in the Senate, I have made working on ‚Äî and understanding ‚Äî issues facing the Native American community a priority. 
At the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum, I was introduced by Melanie Benjamin, Chief Executive of Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. I‚Äôm proud to have her endorsement and I‚Äôll continue to fight for Native American communities and bring that commitment to the White House. 
It‚Äôs always a good idea to make some hotdish. Try my special recipe and help support our grassroots campaign, too!
Even automakers are saying let‚Äôs not rollback these environmental protections. Why is this administration trying to bully businesses into polluting more?
When extreme ideology starts interfering with practical policy, you get things like this: poorer, younger women losing access to birth control.
This President is jeopardizing the health of millions of people. I stand with Planned Parenthood and against the dangerous Title X gag rule.  
Traveling is hard enough as it is ‚Äî let‚Äôs not make it more difficult.
Honored to speak at the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum today, the first dedicated to Native American issues. Thank you ; all for organizing! We must have true government-to-government relations with our tribes.  
I do my job to make a difference in people‚Äôs lives. Ideas are good, but turning ideas into action is what matters.That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done as Senator ; that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do as president. See the over 100 bills I‚Äôve gotten signed into law as the lead Democrat: 
Thanks for your support Burt! I like your direct New Hampshire approach... real results matter. 
Thank you NH State Rep. Liz McConnell  for hosting our campaign‚Äôs first Hot Dish House Party last night. Served my own award-winning recipe! 
Looking forward to being part of Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City today. Proud to have support of many tribal leaders including Chief Exec Melanie Benjamin ; highest ranking U.S. Native American executive office holder Lieutenant Gov 
Daily reminder: Speaking of Greenland...a Greenland ice sheet just lost enough water to fill 4,400,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. In one day.  This is more than climate change, it‚Äôs a climate crisis. We must take action now.
99 years ago today, a woman's right to vote was recognized in our Constitution. We should honor the suffragists, and all those who have struggled for their right to vote, by protecting our democracy and ensuring voting rights for all Americans.
What's a summer day in New Hampshire without picnics! First with the Hillsborough County Dems  then with the Strafford County Dems  ‚Äî happy to have met so many Granite State Democrats who are energized and ready to win.

If you want to run for President, you‚Äôve got to prove you can do the work: I‚Äôve passed over 100 bills into law where I‚Äôm the lead Democrat.
Donald Trump caved to Big Oil. Again. We should be standing with our farmers, not giving secret waivers to multi-billion dollar oil companies. I have long been leading this fight against the administration and as President I will stop these waivers. 
Grabbed one of the last blueberry biscuits from Charleston‚Äôs and crashed a bachelor party in the process this morning! Great to meet owner (and the ‚Äúhands behind the biscuits‚Äù) Carrie Morey and her team.

Last week I embarked on a 20 county tour of Iowa to talk about my ideas to strengthen our rural ; agricultural communities. I'm so honored to have the endorsement of these Iowa farmers that keep America strong! Thank you Pam Johnson, Dan ; Allison Sorenson and Mary Jensen! 
A new Fox poll shows that a strong majority of voters in red states want to see gun safety laws. Good to be with Democrats in Arkansas yesterday who are standing up for what is right.  
We have to remember the courage of the victims and their loved ones in these tragic shootings. As I said in Arkansas yesterday, knowing what they've experienced, how can the Senate continue to cower and refuse to pass gun safety legislation? 
To make progress, it‚Äôs not enough to win the White House ‚Äî we‚Äôll have to win state legislative seats across the country. Proud to sign  and support Democrats on every part of the ballot in 2020.
Thank you Arkansas Democrats! 
Well, here goes I‚Äôve called Trump‚Äôs plan for seniors ‚ÄúMedicare Cuts For All,‚Äù ; the trillions he‚Äôs added to the debt makes it worse. Instead of relitigating ACA, I‚Äôll deal w/the elephant in the room‚Äîlong term care. My seniors plan at

Unions are about the simple idea of shared dreams and shared prosperity. No matter where you come from, no matter who you know or how much money you have, you can make it in America. 
This is not what great democracies do. Vociferous disagreement on issues‚Äîyes. Denying congressional members entry‚Äîno. As for the President‚Äôs message that allowing the congresswomen to visit Israel would be a ‚Äúsign of weakness?‚Äù Exporting intolerance is the true sign of weakness.

Integrity is everything. Thank you so much for your support, Edie!

I‚Äôll say it again: The Senate needs to get back to work. We could pass universal background check legislation that 97% of Americans support. Bring it up for a vote. Now.
Iowa, thank you for the warm welcome in 20 counties and a big finale at your amazing state fair. Getting to meet so many of you and hearing your stories is one of the best parts of campaigning. See you soon! 
TRANSLATION: The President will only secure our elections from foreign interference if he's allowed to suppress the vote. Unacceptable.

Right now, if you commit domestic abuse against your wife, you can‚Äôt get a gun. If you do it to your girlfriend, you can.That‚Äôs outrageous ‚Äî and that's why I lead the bill to close this "boyfriend loophole." We need to pass it now.

 WATCH: on her new gun-safety proposal.  
He‚Äôs at it again: President plays election politics, betting on hate and using legal immigrants as pawns by forcing them to either accept legal benefits which the law allows or reject them to better the chances of getting permanent residence. Call it out.  
Two years ago, a violent white supremacist rally shook Charlottesville and killed Heather Heyer. As President, I'll end the hateful rhetoric that has become all too routine during the Trump administration ; make combating domestic terrorism ; hate-motivated violence a priority.

This has to stop. 
We can bridge the rural-urban divide, and I just visited 20 counties in Iowa to share how we can get it done.
We must pass the bill I lead to close the boyfriend loophole. What does it mean? Federal law says if you‚Äôre convicted of abusing your wife you can‚Äôt get a gun; if it‚Äôs your girlfriend you can. The House passed it; NRA has stopped it.Time for action is now

Day 2 on our Iowa tour ; we‚Äôve hit 14 counties! Met with family farmers in Iowa Falls, spoke about supporting hospitals in Marengo ; sat down with veterans in Marshalltown ; we still have 2 days left! Every day I‚Äôm more convinced than before: we can bridge the rural-urban divide. 
Visited Dave ; Mary Jensen who are soybean ; corn farmers in Hardin County, IA. Mary moved to this farm when she was just 4. We went around the lake on their ranger (as a Minnesotan, can‚Äôt pass up being by the lake) ; talked about how the tariffs are affecting them. 
Here are the nine times that the president promised to support universal background checks in our meeting after Parkland. Then he met with the NRA the next day and folded.No more talk. We need immediate action. As your President I won‚Äôt fold. 
We need to fight the rising tide of domestic terrorism and hate crimes in this country. I've been taking on hate crimes since my days as a prosecutor. I know the bloodshed, pain and trauma these crimes inflict. My plan to help keep our communities safe:

We need to be talking about gun safety reforms everywhere we go, including in rural America ‚Äî that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing in Iowa today. The conversation is changing, and we need to come together to get this done. 
Met many new friends in Storm Lake today.  And thanks to Carol and Rick Peterson for hosting me at your house and on your front lawn this afternoon!

‚ÄúMental illness ; hate pulls trigger, not the gun‚Äù is President‚Äôs dodge to avoid truth: there‚Äôs mental illness;hate throughout world, but U.S. stands alone w/high rate of gun violence. When someone can kill 9 people in a minute, that gun should never have been sold. Action!
‚ÄúWe're going to get it passed." That's what Donald Trump said to me on February 28, 2018 at the White House about gun safety laws after Parkland. Watch...Then he met with the NRA and he caved. 
We must stand up to the NRA. We cannot be a nation where parents are giving their lives to save their children while Senators sit on their hands. 
After Parkland I went to the White House and sat across the table from President Trump to make the case for strong gun laws. I kept track. Nine times he said he wanted universal background checks. Nine times. Then the next day he met with the NRA and folded. No more folding.
Yesterday was a dark day. From El Paso to Dayton in less than 24 hours, we simply cannot go on like this. I mourn for the lives lost and the families devastated. Inaction is unacceptable. No more talk. The time for passing legislation is now. I‚Äôm ready to go back tomorrow.
At the  today, I shared what was on my mind: El Paso. 
Today innocent people‚Äîfamilies‚Äîwent to that mall in El Paso.  Some of them never came home.  The U.S. House has passed common sense gun safety legislation. It is long past time to pass it in the Senate. The question to ask: Whose side are you on? The NRA‚Äôs or the people‚Äôs.
My heart breaks for El Paso and those killed and injured by another mass shooting. This can‚Äôt keep happening. It just can‚Äôt. Every day Congress refuses to act and pass gun laws is a horrible omission of responsibility. This is a tragedy.
The climate crisis is happening NOW. I‚Äôve been to Greenland ; seen this ice sheet. We need action, not denial: More than 11 billion U.S. tons of ice lost to oceans by melt on Wednesday alone, creating July net mass ice loss of 217 billion U.S. tons...

We can't be more worried about winning an argument than winning an election.

Let's get real, we have to beat Donald Trump. My background is a little different than his, and I won't make promises I can't keep.  But I'll promise you this: I can win and I will govern with the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation.  
To win we have to listen to people. That‚Äôs why I finished the  tonight with the story of Casey Jo, a young woman who lost her life to opioids. We need a president who has people‚Äôs backs. As your president, I will make you proud. 
That's a wrap! And just like after the first debates, we're seeing a major wave of enthusiasm for our campaign ‚Äî let's see how big we can make it! Go to  and contribute whatever amount you can, and let's go win this!  
We have to make college more affordable ‚Äî but I don't think that rich kids should get a free four-year degree funded by the taxpayers. Instead, let's target our resources on everyone else. 
What happened in Flint can never happen again, and there are communities across the country facing significant challenges when it comes to accessing clean drinking water. We must invest in our water infrastructure now. 
We can't be more worried about winning the argument than winning an election.
We need a public option to bring down health care costs and we need to bring down the price of prescription drugs -- but I don't think that kicking half of Americans off their current health care will get us there. I have a better way. 
 Thank you for addressing the deadly role of NRA money in politics. The young people are watching.
And I watched and wrote down when nine times he said he wanted universal background checks. The next day he meets with the NRA and he folds. As your president, I will not fold. 
This isn‚Äôt just about a system or it‚Äôs not just about words. This is about the NRA. I sat across from the President of the United States after Parkland because I‚Äôve been a leader on these issues and have the bill to close the Boyfriend Loophole.
Immigrants don't diminish America ‚Äî they are America. I will always fight to make sure we live up to our values. 
My opponent in my first debate ever called me "nothing but a street fighter from the Iron Range." You know what I said? "Thank you." So never tell me I won't fight for what I believe in. 
I have bold ideas that are grounded in reality and I can get them done. The President made a lot of promises and broke them. As President, I promise you this: I will fight for you and govern with integrity.

Hey Baltimore and you are in good company. The President has also attacked: the Notorious RBG, the cast of ‚ÄúHamilton," and the entire country of Sweden (to name a few).
One of those killed in Gilroy was Stephen Romero. ‚ÄúMy son had his whole life to live and he was only 6," said his dad. ‚ÄúThat's all I can say." You see there are never adequate words to describe these tragedies. Action is needed. Gun safety laws passed. The people must be heard.

The Americans with Disabilities Act was passed 29 years ago today, ensuring accessibility for all Americans and prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability. It changed millions of lives and we're a better nation because of it.

I‚Äôve made election security an important part of my campaign for President because it‚Äôs central to our democracy. Election security funding, backup paper ballots, requiring campaigns to report suspicious foreign contacts ‚Äî we need these now.
Breaking: T-Mobile/Sprint approved. The Administration thinks it‚Äôs ok for two of the four major cell phone cos. to combine? This is a bad deal-it means less competition ; more costs. T-Mobile can‚Äôt compete for you for cheaper service against Sprint when they are the same company!

Let‚Äôs get it done. 
My statement on the federal government resuming capital punishment for the first time in nearly two decades: 
My legislation to strengthen election security just went to the Senate floor ‚Äî but Republicans blocked it. Again. And this is a day after Director Mueller confirmed the persistent threats from foreign adversaries. Every American should be alarmed.
Thanks for trying to pass my bill to lift the ban against prescription drug price negotiation under Medicare. Her amendment in the Fiannce Committee was blocked by the Republicans. I‚Äôll try again on the Senate floor! Our seniors deserve less expensive drugs. 
Francisco was born in Dallas. He is an American citizen. But he was stopped and detained for nearly a month ‚Äî even though he had his birth certificate, social security card and state ID. This is outrageous.
Stable and affordable housing is out of reach for too many American families. Today at the convention I announced my policy to expand affordable housing opportunities, provide access to justice, and revitalize neglected neighborhoods. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing it as we sit here.‚Äù That was Robert Mueller‚Äôs response when asked if the Russian government will attack our elections again. Our democracy is in danger. Let‚Äôs take action and pass my election security bill now.
Pharmaceutical companies are now experts at stifling competition. As President, I‚Äôll take on anticompetitive practices to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.

You'll never win Minnesota, Donald Trump.  I'll make sure of it. Our state economy is strong because of our great workers and businesses.  And the last time I checked, racist words and putting a congresswoman and her family in harm‚Äôs way aren‚Äôt very popular in our state. 
This can never happen again. Millions had their financial futures endangered because of the breach. And lax data security isn‚Äôt adequately addressed in this settlement. Congress must act: start by passing my legislation and hold these big companies accountable.

If acting happy is a prerequisite for staying in our country, this president would have been deported on day one of his administration. The only way we strive for a more perfect union is by (happily AND unhappily) advocating for change.

In 2006 I led the state ticket and we flipped the State House from Republican to Democratic by gaining 19 seats (2/5)

Earlier this month, Iowa State Rep endorsed me for president. Marti is an advocate for families, a social worker ; a champion for Des Moines. Excited to head back to Iowa on Monday knowing I have her support!  
No time to waste. There‚Äôs a lot to get done! 
Per NYT: At G-20 reporter asks Trump if he would tell Putin not to meddle in American elections. Trump then says to Putin, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt meddle in the election.‚ÄùThen, wagging his finger in a lighthearted way, he repeats, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt meddle in the election.‚Äù    Now THAT will scare Putin.
Good news: today the House passed my election security bill to require paper ballots, post-election audits, and give states more than a billion dollars to update election equipment. Now the Senate needs to act -- we need a vote on election security now.
Before last night's  I visited the Homestead child detention facility in Florida. What's happening there is heartbreaking. These children deserve better. 
How should we run our country‚Äôs foreign policy? Not by tweeting in a bathrobe at 5 a.m.  
Look at drug prices since President Trump has taken office ‚Äî they've continued to rise and rise. What has the American consumer gotten out of it?  Where I'm from we call that all foam, no beer

 Congratulations Judy!
FYI (in case you missed it, it was because they wanted you to): The Trump Administration continues to suppress research and hide the climate science. 
After four years of Donald Trump, a new President can‚Äôt wait for a bunch of congressional hearings to act. I‚Äôve got a plan for the first 100 days with more than 100 actions we can take right away to address our biggest challenges at home and abroad. 
No one ‚Äî I repeat: no one ‚Äî should have to risk their life with black market insulin. There should never have been a black market to begin with, but it‚Äôs what happens when profits are put before people. Time for that to change.
Domestic violence and stalking force people to live in fear. We must expand protections for dating partners and prevent people convicted of stalking from possessing a gun. This is not complicated.

Two stunning mental health facts have now been ranked true...I think no one believed them because they‚Äôre so startling: (1) suicides up 30% in U.S. in 15 yrs ; (2) only 64 mental health public hospital beds in Iowa. That‚Äôs why I led with my plan to take this on. We can do this.

This administration is simply not interested in ensuring the integrity of our democracy.

After four years of Donald Trump, a new President can‚Äôt wait for a bunch of congressional hearings to act. The urgent problems our country is facing require immediate action. And I have a clear plan for my first 100 Days to do just that. 
Great to see friends like Andrea Jenkins at last night‚Äôs  gala in New York! Pride is a celebration but also a reminder that we must keep marching, keep advocating, and keep fighting!

Remembering the victims of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church four years ago today. Tragedies like this must stop ‚Äî we need to fight racism in all forms and pass legislation to prevent gun violence. Now.
This is great news from the Supreme Court. Gerrymandering undermines the fairness of our elections. Every vote ‚Äî whether cast in Virginia, North Carolina, or anywhere in America ‚Äî must count and never be diluted.
It has been 3,615 days since Congress increased the minimum wage, and the cost of living continues to climb. Workers are way overdue for a raise. 
The right to come together and collectively bargain is a fundamental principle of fairness. I stand with the security officers of downtown Detroit. Their commitment is an inspiration to all who believe in economic justice.  
As President, you are the moral leader of our country. Donald Trump is failing that test of leadership. Here‚Äôs what I said when asked me if he was a ‚Äúgood man.‚Äù

Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney says, regarding things this administration is planning to work on with Democrats, that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a bunch of stuff we‚Äôll do. It‚Äôs just the infrastructure‚Äù that won‚Äôt get done. Yeah, okay... ‚ÄúJust the infrastructure‚Äù‚Ä¶
I believe in science. And that inviting climate change deniers onto your National Security Council is dangerous. We need to get back into the International Climate Change Agreement. Now.
More stonewalling. What are they hiding?
Partisanship is keeping Granite Staters from receiving the mental health services and addiction treatment they need. People are asking for help. Funding for these programs should never be used as a political bargaining chip.

This is an important bill!  People should own their own  data....but there are no clear rules. 
We can have a better America right now, bring people together, ignore the mean tweets, and do something about the issues that matter. Thanks for having me on! 
The President is sending out the same signals he did in 2016: he is inviting foreign powers to interfere in our elections, and that is unacceptable. 
Insulin prices are out of control. No one should ever have to choose between rationing their medicine or financial ruin. These Big Pharma companies think they own Washington. Well, they don‚Äôt own me, and it‚Äôs time we hold them accountable.

‚ÄúBeing brave, for me, means not giving up on the things that make me feel alive.‚Äù She was pure courage. 
I have to know, especially now that the President has invited foreign interference in our election again: what happened with those polling machines in North Carolina in 2016? How were they compromised? And what are we doing to stop it from happening again?
Joined ; today to talk about bringing down pharma costs for seniors. We have to keep this issue at the forefront and stop prescription prices from skyrocketing. A great way to start doing that? Enable Medicare to negotiate fair drug prices.
This is inexcusable. The President of the United States just effectively gave permission to foreign agents to interfere in our elections. We need my Secure Elections Act and Honest Ads Act passed immediately. The 2020 elections are not secure. Disgraceful.

This past weekend in Iowa was one to remember ‚Äî thank you for yet another amazing Hall of Fame celebration! 
The President sold out Iowa‚Äôs farmers by secretly giving Exxon and Chevron waivers intended for small refineries. Full stop.

Year-round E15 could create 1.3 billion gallons of new annual ethanol demand over 5 years and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve long supported it.  BUT Trump's behind-closed-doors RFS waivers to oil companies erased 2.6 billion gallons over just two years.Do the math.
President Trump keeps handing out RFS waivers (meant for small refineries) to giants like Chevron and ExxonMobil. We must rein in these secret waivers that line the pockets of Big Oil at the expense of farmers. 
Just came from Judiciary where I questioned Trump's Acting DHS Secretary. There he said that we do pay a cost for not passing comprehensive immigration reform. The cost? A sane coherent immigration system. Resources to handle asylum;refugee cases. $158 billion in debt reduction.

Representative democracy should actually be representative ‚Äî I'm joining and taking pledge to support  and stop partisan gerrymandering.

The President should be focused on building relationships with our allies while abroad. Instead, he chose to try and start a boycott of an American company because he didn't like some news coverage. Outrageous.

MN has lost a true champion for good. Don Fraser was a neighbor ;friend. He helped me get my start in politics. He was ahead of his time. As a congressman he exposed  human rights abuses around the world. As Mayor of Mpls he advocated for kids. Public service was his calling.
This country should be a place with opportunity for all. As your president, I‚Äôll work to make that a reality. 
In Virginia Beach, 12 lives were tragically ended by a murderer using high-capacity magazines, something we‚Äôve sadly seen before. That‚Äôs why‚Äîamong many other gun safety measures‚ÄîI support legislation to ban these magazines. As president I‚Äôll lead on gun safety ; pass the bills.
I have bills that would bring in safe, affordable prescription drugs from countries like Canada, get generics to market quicker and unleash the bargaining power of millions of seniors.
There is no end in sight to rising drug prices with Donald Trump as president and the Republicans running the Senate, that is true! When I am your president, that will change.

I come from a union family and I will always be proud to stand with working people. It was a joy to speak with members about how we can make sure opportunity for all is a reality. 
 The crowd roars! ‚ÄúThis is about taking our democracy back. We need a constructional amendment to overturn Citizen Unite‚Ä¶
Our democracy doesn‚Äôt work if we can‚Äôt protect and expand the right to vote. Loved spending time with at the  Forum today to talk about some of my big ideas: registering everyone to vote at 18, restoring voting rights and stopping voter suppression.

John and I in San Francisco for the California convention with our friends  and her husband Doug.  Lots of energy out here.   
My thoughts are with the Virginia Beach wounded ; the families of those who lost loved ones today. We can‚Äôt become numb to these tragedies. We must pass gun safety legislation. The vast majority of Americans agree. We just need to get people in Washington who will represent them.
The last time came to Minneapolis to do his show he experienced one of those famous Minnesota blizzards. I can promise this time around it will be warmer. Grab your tickets today! 
Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio have all tried to effectively ban abortion this year. This is a coordinated attack on women's constitutional rights and we must fight back. 
Russia is coming for our elections again, and we need to be ready. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve introduced legislation to secure our elections ‚Äî including backup paper ballots.
Just another example to show that the citizenship census question was added for purely political reasons.  The Supreme Court should not allow this charade to continue.  via

Nevada Democrats are working hard to make progress. Great to meet with Attorney General Speaker and Asst. Majority Leader today. 
It was my honor to speak with veterans in Nevada today about my plan to prioritize mental health care. We have to do more to support those who have given so much. 
Always great to be in Nevada. Thanks, Aaron! 
Good to be here in Carson City, Nevada. Nevada legislature (majority female) is doing great work with the Gov, including expanding voting rights last night. Had excellent discussion with our Northern ; rural Nevada vets. One size doesn‚Äôt fit all when it comes to rural health care 
Thad was civil to everyone regardless of party.  Prayers for his family today. 
OK. This just feeds Putin‚Äôs plans. The grown-up alternative: Congress must stand up and protect our elections. Patriotism means that a democracy should be in the hands of the American people, not a foreign power.  Solution? Pass Honest Ads ; Secure Elections bills. 
This is wonderful news ‚Äî Lonnie Bunch was just in Minnesota speaking at the Minneapolis Club. Congratulations! 
A major victory at  today as signs legislation restoring the right to vote for 77,000 Nevadans. We must do everything we can to strengthen voting rights, stop voter purges, and allow full participation in our democracy.

My statement on the comments Robert Mueller made today: 
When Abigail was born, she couldn't swallow. Not knowing what was wrong was scary. Then I was forced out of the hospital after just 24 hours. So, like I told I fought for one of the nation‚Äôs first mandatory 48-hour hospital maternity stays for moms and their babies

The science is clear: Climate change is happening. Ice sheets and glaciers don‚Äôt lie, they simply melt. We cannot allow this administration to hide the facts.
Yes, it's way past time for the pharma companies that got people hooked on opioids in the first place to be be on the hook for what they've done. Thanks state ; local leaders across the country for taking this on to get the needed resources for treatment.
 One of my favorite activities from the Office Opening! 
Good seeing our favorite veteran today (my dad)! 
Backing ruthless dictators over our allies in the region? This does not show American strength: Still angling for a deal, Trump backs Kim Jong Un over Biden, Bolton and Japan

John gave me auto bingo for my birthday yesterday and our drives through Iowa.  OK I won!   
The excitement Iowans bring to every single election is infectious. A perfect wrap-up to this trip talking to people (including some small small business owners) in Fort Dodge. 
Decorah, Charles City, Iowa Falls, Des Moines, Iowa and a whole lot of singing. No better way to spend my birthday yesterday than talking to people about how we can move this country forward. 
Boone, Iowa is home to a big statue of Teddy Roosevelt, the great Livery Deli and a whole lot of excited Democrats. Thanks for coming out! 
Congrats to the Gophers! I‚Äôll be rooting for you. 
A full house in Des Moines! Thank you to and  in Iowa for a wonderful birthday bash. 
America‚Äôs prosperity depends on supporting our farms and rural communities. That's why I'm in Iowa today unveiling policy priorities to help farmers. They are the backbone of our country, and there's so much more we need to do to help them succeed.
A packed house party at Minority Leader and his wife Ann‚Äôs home. Not a bad way to spend a birthday afternoon ‚Äî with lots of friends from Charles City, Iowa! 
It was a lovely spring morning in Decorah, Iowa! Thanks to the many, many people who came out to our meet and greet at The Lingonberry. 
It's great to spend my birthday with Abigail in Iowa, but she's asking some tough questions... 
So, I got to ring in my birthday a little early last night with a rousing chorus from my friends at the Thank you! 
Speaker Pelosi did a great job at our dinner last night. Abigail and John there too! 
Thank you Speaker Pelosi for joining us at the Humphrey-Mondale Dinner last night and for being an example of a strong woman and leader for us all.  
Worth a read: Why it‚Äôs so alarming that Trump shared an edited video of Pelosi 
There are insidious forces every day that are trying to make it harder for people to vote, trying to drown out our voices with big money.So it‚Äôs time to organize. Time to galvanize. Time to take back our democracy.  
I‚Äôm about to go live at the  Dinner in Minnesota with the Tune in: 
It's unbelievable that the President of the United States would be involved in a disinformation campaign, but it's happening. We need to put real rules of the road in place online, pass my Honest Ads Act, ; encourage Americans to be diligent about the sources they go to for news. 
The President chose to walk out of a bipartisan meeting and play partisan politics to hide the fact that his infrastructure plan is a mirage. He doesn't have one! But I do, it's paid for, and it will create good-paying American jobs. 
The coordinated attack on women's health care continues. This is dangerous and unconstitutional, and we must fight back. 
Facebook removed over 2 billion bots in just the first quarter. We need to pass my Honest Ads Act to provide transparency on political social media ads so Americans know exactly who is trying to influence our elections. 
We had a great campaign headquarters office opening party last night! Tons of people, cool space, great staff and snow cones to commemorate our snow announcement! Proud to be headquartered in the Midwest.  
Wonderful office opening tonight with so many volunteers.  Thanks to our staff, family and friends!  Here‚Äôs one of our favorites...She‚Äôs ready to go to Iowa! 
Mark my words: We will see Trump's tax returns.
The Society of Civil Engineers gives America‚Äôs infrastructure a D+. And the President literally couldn‚Äôt even sit down at the table to try and find a solution. Meanwhile, I have a plan and it‚Äôs fully paid for. Let‚Äôs get this fixed.
Breaking: Senate just passed disaster relief bill which includes help for damage from Midwest floods, Florida;Southern hurricanes ; storms, Western fires and...yes and finally Puerto Rico! No coincidence that after months of waiting, the vote took place during a tornado warning!
While they need help, farmers would rather farm and sell what they produce instead of getting a bailout! The President must get back to the negotiating table. This is real, people are suffering and small farms are going under.
I will never forget seeing Janice stand with her beautiful granddaughter and bravely talk about her daughter‚Äôs struggle with addiction and mental health. This issue affects so many, and we need to act now. Read her story:
On Sept. 29, 2018 a 10-year-old child died in U.S. custody ‚Äî and we‚Äôre just learning about it now. This cannot keep happening. We need an investigation and we need to hold the Administration accountable. 
Every day there‚Äôs a new story about how we face extraordinary challenges due to climate change. I can‚Äôt stress this enough: We need to act NOW before it‚Äôs too late.
The President‚Äôs decision to exit the Iran nuclear agreement has created grave risks. Why deal with dangerous and notoriously bad guys by losing our leverage, abandoning our allies,and giving the keys to the hard-liners?  
So there you have it!  No ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù to say what you think in the Republican Party of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos: DeVos family ends financial support for Rep. Amash

As one of the first openly LGBTQ elected officials in the United States, Harvey Milk was a trailblazer and inspiration. Let's honor his legacy by continuing to work for full equality for all.  
And the bridges and internet and roads still aren‚Äôt fixed, they can‚Äôt drink the water in Flint, but this is all the President had to say today. I rolled out a paid-for real plan for infrastructure. It‚Äôs time to stop the griping start the governing.  
Here we are in another  This time the President says he won't work on infrastructure if Congress does its job and conducts legitimate oversight. Rebuilding roads, bridges, and schools should not be partisan. I have a plan to do it: 
Today I stood with my colleagues to call for the Senate to pass the Violence Against Women Act. It‚Äôs hung up in the Senate because of my provision w/ to close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to get guns. Senate Republicans should choose women over the NRA.

No. We need Director Mueller to testify in public. On the record. Period.
As recently as 2018, Kremlin-linked officials were discussing how to sow hatred and violence in the United States. This is a dress rehearsal for 2020. We need to protect our elections and pass the Honest Ads Act and my election security legislation. Now.
In blocking former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying this morning, the White House is now obstructing a hearing about obstruction. As Rep. said: "Our subpoenas are not optional."
Women‚Äôs reproductive rights are under attack across the country. I‚Äôm here on the Supreme Court steps at the rally to take back our rights. Today we must stand together to  I will always stand up for women‚Äôs health care. 
The Judge says it all‚Ä©‚ÄúIt is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President..would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct-past or present-even without opening an impeachment inquiry‚Äù 
This is the sad truth: suicides have increased in America by 30% in the last 15 years. It‚Äôs one reason I‚Äôve put out a plan to address mental health issues and make sure those suffering from mental illness can get the help they need.
This is just wrong. The White House is telling the former WH Counsel not to comply with a Congressional subpoena. The Trump Administration seems to forget what Thomas Paine said: in America, the law is king ‚Äî not the other way around. 
So inspiring to see the good work being done by all the members of We must keep working to end senseless gun violence, stand up to the gun lobby and pass universal background checks.

We've got some wonderful house parties planned today in the Granite State. First up ‚Äî Nashua and Salem. Favorite moments: signing the "Winner's Wall" and a packed house (right by the lake) 
Went on Fox this morning to talk about the attacks on women's health. No matter what TV station people watch, they need to know the truth. 
We need the truth and we need to protect our democracy ‚Äî and neither should be partisan. Yet, the White House made calls to shut down my Secure Elections Act. No matter what, I'm going to keep fighting for answers and working to protect our elections. 
In New Hampshire last night for the spaghetti dinner in Keene. Thanks to Carl DeMatteo, JoAnn Fenton, Debora Pignatelli, and an incredible crowd committed to electing NH Democrats and taking back the White House!

Just one more reason to love Duluth! Duluth's 97-year-old hockey legend Mark Sertich keeps on skating. 
My dad struggled with alcoholism and I know the difference treatment made for him and my family. Everyone deserves that same chance. We must invest in addiction treatment and mental health care ‚Äî and the pharmaceutical companies that caused this problem should pay for it. 
These politicians in Alabama, Georgia, and across the country are using women as political pawns to overturn Roe v. Wade. If you care about families' rights to make their own decisions, this election could not be more important. 
30 states still lack comprehensive protections for LGBTQ people. The passage of the  in the House of Representatives is a crucial step towards fixing that. The Senate should follow suit ; make sure all Americans have the equality promised to them in the Constitution.
Election security is national security, and we need to get serious about protecting our electoral process. Otherwise, we will be vulnerable to a repeat of 2016. That‚Äôs why I introduced my Election Security Act with 37 cosponsors to defend against foreign interference
We are entering very dangerous territory with these attacks on reproductive rights. Republicans are setting up a fight at the Supreme Court to take away crucial access to women‚Äôs health care. We‚Äôve got to keep fighting these attacks.

 nails it. Voter suppression is real, insidious and undermining our democracy. This has been a top priority for me in the Senate and will continue to be in the White House.
To the President/NSA Advisor Bolton/Sec. Pompeo: The authorization for the use of military force that Congress passed in 2001 against al-Qaeda DOES NOT AUTHORIZE a war against Iran. Saber-rattling ; risking the lives of our men ; women while eschewing diplomacy is not leadership.
We know Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and we know they‚Äôre trying to do it again in 2020. Protecting our democracy shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. Congress must pass my bipartisan election security legislation now.
This is a coordinated attack on women's health and an attempt to turn back the clock to a time before Roe v. Wade. We have to stop this. 
Every family in America should have access to broadband internet connection regardless of zip code. Yesterday, the Senate Commerce Committee passed two of my bills to make that a reality for rural communities.

I'll say it again: The Georgia and Alabama abortion bans are wrong. They are dangerous. They are unconstitutional. And they are out of step with the majority of Americans. 
I guess it's good that some in this administration are finally admitting the truth about Russian interference in our elections ‚Äî but now they need to get serious about stopping it from happening again.

I'm so proud of my friend for bravely standing on the Senate floor and sharing her experience with depression. I'm with her in the fight to end the stigma and make mental health care a priority in this country.
Another attack on people of faith and their place of worship...this time during Ramadan. We must reject hate and hold those responsible accountable.
This bill in Alabama is effectively a ban on abortion. This is wrong. This is unconstitutional.  Screen Shot 2019-05-14 at 9.35.41 PM.png
The Administration‚Äôs reckless policies increase the risk of armed conflict;isolate the U.S. The President was wrong to withdraw from the Iran Agreement and he can‚Äôt draw us into war w/out authorization from Congress. Acting alone makes America less safe.¬†
And now you see why we must pass the Secure Elections Act and Director Mueller must testify. 
It‚Äôs  and a time for us to face the reality of discrimination in maternal care. Women of color are much more likely to die because of preventable health care issues. This is a problem that can and must be fixed.
Thanks and for bringing awareness to the importance of treatment courts ‚Äî they are a critical part of addressing addiction... and they work!

Disaster relief is a humanitarian issue, not a wedge issue, no matter what the president says. Thank you Gov. for meeting with me to discuss how we can work together to rebuild disaster-affected areas in Puerto Rico. 
In Puerto Rico. The date on this whiteboard is Sept. 15th 2017, just days before Hurricane Maria struck. This school, Escuela Juan Antonio Corretjer, remains closed. It is a tragic reminder that as disaster relief is held up, we are failing our children, our fellow U.S. citizens. 
En PR. La fecha en esta pizarra es 15 de sept. de 2017, d√≠as despu√©s de que azotara Irma y d√≠as antes de Mar√≠a. La Escuela Juan Antonio Corretjer, sigue cerrada, como un recordatorio tr√°gico que la ayuda no ha llegado. Le estamos fallando a nuestra ni√±ez y a nuestros compatriotas 
It‚Äôs simple: Americans want leadership that brings people together. I‚Äôm visiting with leaders in Puerto Rico today to listen to their needs, and find ways to help.

Addiction and mental health issues can affect any family ‚Äî including mine. That's why I put out a plan to tackle this head on and get people the treatment they need. 
Joined last night to talk about what it's like to run for president and why I'm headed to Puerto Rico 
Paid family leave is just common sense ‚Äî it helps working families and our economy. Gov. Sununu's veto of SB1 hurts Granite Staters. As president, I'd make ensuring paid family leave a priority  
The law Gov. Kemp signed in Georgia bans women from making their own health care decisions. It literally makes them criminals if they leave the state to seek the care they need. Health care decisions should be between patients and doctors. End of story.
Congrats to Minnesota‚Äôs Ann Kim of on her prestigious James Beard Award!
The needs to come to the table to negotiate. Its workers are fighting for better benefits, better compensation, job security and dignity in the workplace. I stand with and support their right to organize.
Please, take a minute and listen to Janice Weiner. Her powerful story about her daughter‚Äôs battle with substance use highlights why it's so important to combat addiction and prioritize mental health care. 
Veterans‚Äô wounds aren‚Äôt always visible. Access to mental health care is so important, and we need to make it a priority in this country.
Last night I had noted that doing the FOX town hall was a little bit like being a Vikings fan walking onto Lambeau Field, but I've always said you can't just go where it's comfortable. I want to move this country forward for all Americans.
President Trump‚Äôs tax bill has wreaked havoc on the survivor benefits of Gold Star families. I joined in introducing a bill to fix this for our families who have already made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.
Just on floor for first floor speech.  A cool first: She was the first Senator to use her maiden speech to try to get something done! She asked for senate to pass a resolution to defend the Affordable Care Act from the Republican lawsuit. The Republicans objected.
AG Barr told me to ask Director Mueller for President Trump‚Äôs tax returns myself ‚Äî so I did. I still don‚Äôt have them. It‚Äôs just one more reason Director Mueller needs to come before Congress and testify.
I think to be a progressive, you have to make progress. I've stood up for our shared beliefs and I've gotten stuff done too. That's what I'll continue to do as your president.

Health care decisions should be between patients and their doctors. Period. 
I love my dad. He struggled with alcohol for a long time ‚Äî and I‚Äôve seen the toll addiction can take. I‚Äôve also seen how treatment can change a person‚Äôs life. That‚Äôs why I released a plan to get people the addiction and mental health care treatment they need  
I want to protect people with pre-existing conditions. I want to make sure everyone has access to health care. And I want to do it as quickly as possible 
Here‚Äôs my bottom line: Robert Mueller conducted an investigation to protect our democracy and he needs to testify before Congress. The President cannot hide the report 
So very sorry to hear this. My thoughts are with Larry's family and the entire ATU community as we mourn a real fighter for working people. 
We need to see the full report in order to protect our elections. We've been warned over and over that the Russians are going to do this again. What is President Trump afraid of? 
Drug manufacturers are taking in huge profits while Americans face skyrocketing prices for their life-saving medicine. My bill ends pay-for-delay tactics and helps make lower-cost generics available for all Americans.

Trump‚Äôs White House is blocking bipartisan legislation that would help prevent another attack on our elections. America deserves a president who will stand up to its adversaries. Our democracy is on the line.
Thanks to the for inviting me to  yesterday to talk about the issues that matter the most to American families. 
Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election was just a dress rehearsal for what they plan to do in 2020. We need to pass the Honest Ads Act now to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. 
Seems clearer than ever that we need to see President Trump's full tax returns...
My heart goes out to the victims ; their families at the STEM School Highlands Ranch, just eight miles away from Columbine High School. This has to stop. We must pass federal laws to end gun violence.  
I had so much fun meeting these girls at the Des Moines, Iowa Farmers Market this weekend! ‚ú® 
In America, the type of healthcare you receive shouldn't be determined by the color of your skin.

Thanks Tim!  That was a really fun event last night in Iowa City.  This video captures the spirit! 
It was great to see and all of you last night! 
Means a lot coming from you, Together, we can tackle this problem. 
Joined  on  today..Russian interference in our elections is not a ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù It was‚Äîand is‚Äîa reality.  As President I will take the word of the FBI ; American Intelligence agents over Vladimir Putin‚Äôs.  
The President should start advocating for the safety of all Americans, and stop pandering to those who openly spread hate. 
My plan to address addiction and mental health includes our veterans. When they signed up to serve our country there wasn‚Äôt a waiting line. There should never be one for them to get the care they need. 
Thanks for the operatic shout-out on  last night.  It was great to see Opera Man again! I just got back from Iowa, and FYI-o: no one-o should count out the women yet-o! 
Wow! What a fired up crowd in Iowa City. 
Everywhere I go I hear moving stories about what addiction treatment and mental health care would mean for families. Addressing this issue must be a national priority. Thank you to everyone in Iowa City who came to share their stories and talk about how we can do this together. 
It was standing room only in Grinnell, Iowa today! Thanks to the Drake Community Library for having us, and to everyone who came out to our meet ; greet. 
Stopped by Dan's Sandwich Shop in Newton, Iowa to have one of their famous maid-rites. Dan and Pam Holtkamp have served a lot of people delicious food here in the last 49 years, including Barack Obama! 
Spring is here in Grinnell, Iowa! 
It's so clear talking to people that we need real action to help combat substance use disorders and prioritize mental health care. Thank you to the students, faculty and community leaders who joined the conversation at Drake University in Des Moines today. 
Came down to Iowa for the opening day with Rep. and our Iowa State Chair Got to see Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie and make some new friends (including a fine, feathered one) 
Good day in Detroit today. Lots happening. Thanks to Wayne County Commissioner and the entire leadership team for hosting us! 
I‚Äôve got a plan to combat addiction and prioritize mental health, and it‚Äôs paid for by holding the opioid manufacturers who helped get us into this mess accountable.
At today‚Äôs National Organization of Black County Officials Conference, I talked about infrastructure, investing in the next generation and my plan to help people with mental health and substance use issues get the help they need to overcome their struggles 
Sat down this morning with and the team at to talk about my dad, his story of overcoming addiction and my plan to make sure everyone has the same chance he did to get better. 
Here are a few ways we can do that:1. Promote early intervention and prevention tactics for substance use2. Expand access to treatment for addiction and mental health issues3. Improve training for health care professionals4. Support ongoing recovery
In 2017, an estimated 21 million people needed substance use treatment, but fewer than 20 percent were able to access it. With my plan, more people will get the help they need and the care they deserve.
I love my dad. He struggled with alcohol for a long time, but with the help of family, faith, community and treatment he got better. In his own words he was ‚Äúpursued by grace.‚Äù I believe everyone should have that chance. 
We've got to be able to do two things at once. Let's find out the truth about Russia's interference in our democracy and protect people's health care. Thanks for having me 
Thanks for shining some light on my letter to Director Mueller. Here's the deal ‚Äî we need to know if the President's finances were looked at in this investigation and if they were, then they should be provided to Congress. 
Trump: ‚ÄúNow Mueller, I assume, for $35 million, checked my taxes, checked my financials...‚ÄùI asked AG Barr if the taxes were reviewed ; he surprisingly said he didn‚Äôt know ; I should ‚Äúask Bob Mueller when he comes here.‚Äù Today I did. I sent a letter. Mueller needs to testify.

This is THE definitive bipartisan election security bill. Our nation's top law enforcement officer shouldn't have to think twice about protecting our elections.

Looks like I‚Äôll be up for questioning Barr right around 12:50 EC Time. Right after Cruz....
OK the AG just said he didn‚Äôt want to send out Mueller‚Äôs summaries and that he didn‚Äôt want to do summaries. But then he sent out a four-page summary himself? There is no other way to describe his letter which contained summary facts and conclusions.

Good to see the great cooking team at Popol Vuh and Centro in Minneapolis tonight. Great place to eat! 
Got to talk about two of my favorite things at the Communication Workers of America District 7 conference in Minnesota today: 1) expanding broadband and 2) Democrats winning in 2020! 
We could be entering a new Gilded Age ‚Äî we have to take on the power of these big corporations now. 
I will always stand up for the rights of trans Americans. On this  please know that you are loved and supported. And that I will always fight for you.

First responders and community volunteers have been working around the clock in the Midwest to save homes and businesses. I stopped by a pancake breakfast at the Hornick, Iowa Volunteer Fire ; Rescue to say thank you. 
Thank you to and for hosting an important conversation about the future of our country.
At the Heartland Forum in Storm Lake, Iowa today with a simple message: I will never leave rural America behind. My ideas? An agenda for rural America that includes housing, health care, broadband, education, strong farm and antitrust policies. 
It was great spending time in Omaha, Nebraska yesterday. What I heard there was what I‚Äôm hearing all around the country ‚Äî voters want someone who can get the job done. 
Our rural communities are the backbone of our economy. I support Farmers Bill of Rights and will continue to stand up for our family farmers.
Fran and Jason‚Äôs Iowa house is still under water. The house stood for 100 years but this flooding‚Äî2 1/2 miles from the river‚Äîwas like no other. Parents of twin four-year-olds, they are stoic and strong. This is why we must build better infrastructure ; take on climate change. 
Last night I went all in with on my  budget priority: fixing America‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure. 
Amy‚Äôs got a plan for America‚Äôs infrastructure. And we know she can get the job done. 
No group of people know more about building America‚Äôs infrastructure than our union workers.Thank you to LiUNA 1140 for hosting us today! 
Thank you to Farmers Mutual Telephone Company's Kevin Cabbage and Montgomery County Development Corp's Shawnna Silvius for having us.
Yesterday, I announced my infrastructure plan. Today, I‚Äôm hitting the road.First stop: Stanton, IA to discuss my plan to expand broadband to every household by 2022. 
If you missed it, I swung by yesterday to talk about infrastructure, health care and how we can win in 2020. 
The people of Flint, Michigan still have to rely on bottled water. All across America, communities face challenges when it comes to access to clean drinking water. We must invest in our water infrastructure now. 
üé∂Back in town-ow-ownüé∂¬† 
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm calling for a major investment in our roads, highways and bridges.
When the 35W Bridge collapsed in Minnesota, we came together as a community to rebuild it in just 13 months. But here‚Äôs the truth: A bridge shouldn‚Äôt fall down in the middle of America ‚Äî or anywhere in America. 
Let's get it done, 
Extension to allow hardworking Liberians to stay in MN has been granted by White House! We worked hard to get this done.  and ; I joined advocates for the Liberian community last week. We can celebrate today and work for permanent status tomorrow.
Over half of our schools need repairs to be considered in ‚Äúgood‚Äù condition. Just look at some of the schools in Baltimore that didn‚Äôt have heat in the dead of winter. We need to update the physical and digital infrastructure of our crumbling schools. 
Broadband is the cornerstone of keeping rural America competitive in the 21st century and beyond. I will help close the urban-rural divide and connect every household to the internet by 2022.
The Trump Administration continues to cause chaos in our health care system. Instead of repeal, we should be talking about commonsense steps we can take immediately to bring down costs and expand health care. 
Started my day at to talk about my bold, new infrastructure plan with and 
We haven‚Äôt kept pace with the demand for reliable and safe public transportation, particularly for low-income communities. With smart investments, we can bridge the gap. We must invest in public transportation and rail.
What we‚Äôve seen in the Midwest this year should be a wake-up call. We must update our levees, fix our dams and provide additional protections against the serious threat of flooding. 
The President's infrastructure plan leaves the details up to the imagination, my trillion-dollar infrastructure plan is a commonsense, concrete proposal to rebuild America. I won‚Äôt just say I‚Äôll get the job done, I will get it done. 
This plan will create millions of good-paying jobs, support our unions, prioritize American-made materials, and protect our environment.
When we started this campaign, I said I would tell the truth. Here‚Äôs the truth: Our infrastructure is falling apart and we need bold action to fix it. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm announcing a trillion-dollar plan to overhaul and build America‚Äôs infrastructure. 
!!!  Five Trump trips to Mar-a-Lago would cover Betsy Devos‚Äôs proposed Special Olympics cuts 
The gun lobby now reportedly opposes the Violence Against Women Act because of a provision I authored in the Senate to help protect women from stalkers.Well, I won't apologize for putting safety first. 
Important question As I said at event today, proposed cuts to by Betsy DeVos are an affront to our values. Kids with disabilities can‚Äôt write checks ; thus got on the chopping block. But their power comes from the people. I will fight these cuts. 
Your leaders should be accountable to you. We‚Äôre running this campaign the old-fashioned way ‚Äî person-to-person and dollar-by-dollar.
The Constitution says that everybody gets a vote. That is not what's happening right now. Today, and I led the introduction of legislation to expand and protect our democracy. Let‚Äôs get it passed! 
Last night I spoke until we closed down the Senate, reading 100 letters from people whose preexisting conditions would get them kicked off insurance w/o ACA. By announcing the repeal they actually became the party of ‚Äútaking away people‚Äôs health care!‚Äù 
The letters I read tonight are just a small window into the fears of millions of Americans if the Affordable Care Act is eliminated. This isn't about politics, this is about people. And I will fight on their behalf to the very end.
In 2015, Jen donated a kidney to a stranger. Without the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs protections, she would have a pre-existing condition that could cause her to be¬†denied or charged more for coverage.
As an educator, Elizabeth has seen the importance of the mental health coverage guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act. If the Affordable Care Act is eradicated, she worries about her students.
Jeffrey takes medication every 24-hours to stop the advance of his MS. He says that the Affordable Care Act has ‚Äúallowed me to remain a productive wage earner for me and my family.‚Äù
Noel was able to recover from a chronic illness while staying on her parents‚Äô health care plan. She‚Äôs worried that she‚Äôll be punished for her pre-existing condition when she gets her own health care plan if the ACA is repealed.
Mike says, ‚ÄúMy wife and I are uninsurable without the ACA.‚Äù
At 29, Chris was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. Before the ACA, he wasn‚Äôt able to purchase health care insurance. If the ACA is repealed his family worries his life will be shortened.
Debbie is self-employed and runs two businesses. She says, ‚ÄúIf the ACA is repealed and there is no marketplace for me to purchase insurance, I will be forced to close my businesses.‚Äù
Kathy needed 24-hour infusions for 5¬Ω days during each round of chemotherapy during her battle with cancer. She writes, ‚ÄúNow that the ACA is up in the air, I feel like I‚Äôm fighting for my life again!‚Äù
Kate calls her son, "the baby that almost didn‚Äôt happen" after battling cancer. She wrote, "Because of the ACA, I faced a future of hope."
Because of the Affordable Care Act, Delaney is able to get mammogram screenings to see if she carries the same genetic trait that several of her relatives have.
The Trump Administration supports totally undoing the Affordable Care Act. I‚Äôm headed to the Senate floor to read the letters of 100 families from across the country who would suffer if these protections went away. 
Good idea on fixing teacher pay gap from  
Thanks to Action for turning out for the hearing today as well as and and Parkland students.  Thanks for being the voice for the victims of gun violence.  The nation is listening (and voting). 
In Judiciary hearing on gun safety Extreme Risk Orders. In the words of Amanda Wilcox of CA whose college student daughter Laura was killed by someone who shouldn‚Äôt have had gun: ‚ÄúOne can always give a gun back, I can never get her life back.‚Äù
The Affordable  Care Act means that people can‚Äôt get kicked off their insurance for pre-existing conditions. With the stroke of a pen, this court filing by the administration would take that away.  I will fight this. 
This is outrageous and shows exactly where this President is coming from. Millions of Americans would lose their health care if this administration had their way: In shift, Trump administration backs judge‚Äôs ruling that would kill Obamacare - POLITICO 
At our town hall in Rye, NH I talked about how America needs a leader who can bring people together and have their backs. That's how we can win this election. 
This is what is happening in many places in the midwest. Shutdowns and chaos and secret oil waivers don‚Äôt help:  Farm income in Minnesota fell 8 percent last year, worst year since early 1980s. 
How many more children will be hurt by gun violence ‚Äî directly or indirectly ‚Äî before we listen to their voices, take action and pass sensible gun safety legislation?We can get this done. We must. 
The entire Mueller report must be made public.  Discussed it today on with  and Klobuchar demands "entire" Mueller report - CBS News

New Hampshire Seacoast story: U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar strode onstage to fervent applause in the packed Rye Junior High School gymnasium Saturday. The scoreboard was lit with ‚Äú20 to 20,‚Äù a nod to her run for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination. 
Everywhere I go people are focused on the issues that affect their jobs ; their families. And they‚Äôre also focused on making sure our democracy works. Americans deserve a president who will look out for working people AND protect our democracy. We can do two things at once. 
Congrats, President Carter! I‚Äôm looking forward to the next time we can have pimento cheese sandwiches together. 
From health care to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard ‚Äî we covered it all. Great questions and an even better crowd. Thank you to everyone who attended our town hall today! 
Hello Rye, NH! Excited for our town hall today. 
This isn‚Äôt about politics ‚Äî it‚Äôs about our democracy. This report must be released. 
I‚Äôll be on with tonight to talk about the Mueller report. Here‚Äôs a preview: AG Barr must release the report to the American people.
BREAKING: The Mueller report is complete. Attorney General Barr must release the full report to the public. The American people deserve to know the facts.

Always want to get that Leslie Knope Park and Recs vote! 
Here‚Äôs why people voted Democratic in 2018: If it works with his base, he‚Äôll do it, no matter how craven. Who cares if it‚Äôs a man who courageously served his country and died 7 months ago...For Trump, attacking McCain is way to appeal to his political base 
We have 4000 health care job openings in MN. Liberians have been here LEGALLY on deferred status for decades. Why would the administration want to leave seniors without care providers? Senior care facilities brace for loss of Liberian immigrant workers. 
This is the kind of pro-democracy action we need: has started initiative to get 1 million Floridians to register to vote! 
If you'd like to help those affected by flooding in the Midwest, here are several ways to pitch in: 
It doesn't take an expert in information security to know that this is just sloppy. My bipartisan legislation would make sure that you get to decide what's done with your data and that these companies are held accountable when they mess up. 
Congrats to the U of M Gophers in the first round of the NCAA!  Gophers, Gabe Kalscheur pull off NCAA tournament surprise, beat Louisville in opener. 
It can still snow while record heat is warming our oceans, devastating fires are burning down towns ; rivers are flooding. I wish the President would hear from retired CA firefighter Jim Klump who I met this week. Let's stop arguing about science ; start working on solutions.

This week I joined my friend in Chicago to talk about the need to invest in our infrastructure. 
The President attacked John McCain again today, saying he‚Äôs not a fan. John McCain died seven months ago. Enough. 
Congratulations to The Sioux Chef‚Äôs Sean Sherman! He just won one of only five James Beard Leadership awards for 2019 for his work to educate and make indigenous foods more accessible to as many communities as possible.
As your president, I‚Äôll work for you. That means not kicking people off of their insurance for preexisting conditions, lowering prescription drug prices and universal coverage. I talked about it on with this weekend. 
I‚Äôm about leading from the heart and getting things done. If that takes a fight, I‚Äôll do it. And if that means working with people you don‚Äôt always agree with to get it done, I‚Äôll do that too.
I serve on the Commerce Committee and we must have an oversight investigation on what happened. 
Congratulations to Siad Ali of my Minnesota staff for this prestigious Bush fellowship. For over a decade Siad has worked in our office serving the public with such energy and care. He‚Äôs also a school board member. So happy for you Siad!

Wrapped up another Iowa weekend in Davenport! Thanks to for the introduction and to everyone who came out. Good to meet many new friends including a Vietnam vet. 
Great event in Davenport today.  Thanks  Dems!

 It was my pleasure to introduce to my beloved city!  
I'm so grateful to for their work to shorten the moral arc of history and get us closer and closer to justice for all.

In this dark moment, we must stand up for our Muslim community. 
Amy‚Äôs speech to the Human Rights Campaign today got several standing ovations. To get a sense of how our next President combines emotion, stories, tears and humor, watch it here. This is what leadership looks like:

We must condemn hate without equivocation and stand up for its victims, whether they worship in our Mosques, synagogues or churches 
This is heartbreaking. My prayers are with the people  of New Zealand and the families of those 49 killed and dozens injured at the mosques in Christchurch. People should be able to worship in this world without fear and know they will come home safe.  
Minnesota-made boots that are ACTUALLY made for walking! 
I have a bipartisan bill that would help ensure your right to privacy online. I think it‚Äôs clear we need to pass it.
Thinking of Evan and the Bayh family today.Senator Birch Bayh authored two Constitutional amendments, wrote Title IX, and sponsored the Equal Right Amendment in the Senate. His legacy is one we can all aspire to. 
Yesterday I spoke with ; members about how we can  ; stop this gag order. Because medical decisions should be between patients and doctors. Thanks to the MN ; IA members who waited outside so we could enjoy the balmy weather (by midwest standards)! 
The Constitution doesn't have an article about unfulfilled campaign promises. This was a bipartisan rebuke of the President‚Äôs unconstitutional power grab.
Right now in most states LGBTQ Americans can be fired or evicted just for who they are. The Equality Act is a vital step to correct these wrongs and Senate Republicans should bring it to a vote. 
As the daughter of a newspaperman, I know the importance of a free press.It‚Äôs an honor to receive First Amendment Defender Award. See, I was listening Dad! 
We will not turn a blind eye to the suffering of the Yemeni people. Today's vote sends a strong bipartisan message that continuing to support the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen is inconsistent with our values. 
Don‚Äôt forget that the Trump Administration is quietly trying to make ùê•ùêûùê†ùêöùê• immigration more difficult.
In the words of Sen. Wellstone -- ‚ÄúWe all do better when we all do better.‚Äù This budget just doesn‚Äôt get us there. The President‚Äôs budget is irresponsible, it doesn‚Äôt reflect our values, and it hurts the American people. (5/5)
And even the President‚Äôs OWN budget projects that debt held by the public will hit $22.8 trillion by 2025, more than 50 percent higher than the year President Trump took office.  And that's under a ‚ÄúPollyanna‚Äù economic forecast that also uses every budget gimmick in the book (4/)
The President seems to have forgotten another campaign promise that he wouldn‚Äôt cut Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security.His budget cuts all three. (3/)
To fulfill a campaign promise, he‚Äôs asked for $8.6 billion for his wall. Didn‚Äôt work last year, isn‚Äôt going to work this year. (2/)
Families across the country sit around the kitchen table making tough choices about their household budgets. The American people expect their President to do the same. So, let‚Äôs talk about the President‚Äôs budget proposal... (1/)

We‚Äôve seen these big tech companies ignore your right to privacy over and over. If they were being taxed when they shared user data, they would think twice about it and the resources could go back to protect you! 
The Senate Republicans must bring HR 1 to a vote. Our democracy demands it. 
These men and women just want to serve their country like any other servicemember. They should be thanked -- not shut out.
Few places in our country see the dangerous effects of climate change more than Florida. Yesterday, I met with local leaders and environmental activists in Tampa to discuss my plans to address this crisis. 
The President has proposed a budget that cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from domestic programs like Medicare and environmental protections. But he still found billions of dollars for his wall.We need a smart budget, not one based on empty campaign promises.

People need to feel confident that antitrust enforcement is impartial ; free of political influence. That‚Äôs why ; I are pressing the DOJ to respond to allegations that the White House attempted to interfere with the AT;T-Time Warner merger.
Amy‚Äôs not taking money from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. She‚Äôs relying on your help to get the message out. Join the team:  
First this Administration wanted to take up to $3.6B from military construction projects. Now it's $1B from military pay and pensions. Enough! It's unacceptable to fund their wall on the backs of our soldiers.
The biggest weekends in Minnesota: the State Fair and  Best hair in the game! Good luck to all the teams at the Xcel today! 
Amy at  on the big tech companies: "I like that they brought in new ideas and new innovations, but I don't like that they've been saying 'trust us' for so long and we did it." 
Foreign powers have been interfering in our elections -- and they‚Äôll keep doing it unless we stop them. That should make everyone wake up and realize that we must invest in cybersecurity  
If politicians have to tell you they paid for TV ads, they should have to do the same online. My bipartisan Honest Ads act would bring transparency and accountability 
Monopolization kills competition and increases costs for consumers. That‚Äôs why we need antitrust laws that are as sophisticated as these big tech companies 
If the big social media companies had to pay taxes every time they used your private data to generate profits, maybe they would think twice before using/abusing it 
I‚Äôll be on with journalist and tech expert shortly. You can watch along here: 
A fitting way to honor International Women‚Äôs Day.  Thanks Senator Flowers for showing what strength is all about: GOP lawmaker tried to silence a black senator in a gun law debate. She stood her ground ‚Äî and won. 
I've been leading the charge to create automatic voter registration, implement nationwide same-day registration, and protect our elections from foreign interference. I don't believe these should be partisan priorities ‚Äî our democracy is for everyone. Let's get it done.

We should be making it easier for everyone to vote, not harder. Glad to see New Hampshire Democrats defending the Granite State‚Äôs tradition of voter participation. 
Thanks to Fred and Cindy Warmbier for standing up in memory of their son Otto. The lesson? The President, in turn,  should be standing up to dictators like Kim Jong Un and Putin and the S.A. Prince.  Not flattering them by denying the clear truth of his own intelligence forces. 
Good to see Minnesota-based committing to a sustainable future!
It‚Äôs telling to see whose word the President trusts: Putin and Kim Jong Un. Who does he doubt? His own intelligence officials

Apprenticeships provide critical real-world skills ‚Äî all while paying students. Glad to see more industries adopting this pathway to success.
A lot can happen when you work to find common ground and prioritize solutions. Thank you so much to my staff who work so hard for the people of our state and country.
Today I met with some of the inspiring students from March for Our Lives to discuss how we can make it easier for people to vote. That includes passing my bills to automatically register every eligible person when they turn 18 ; give everyone the option of same day registration.
Asked Secretary Perdue today about problems with the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) reservation system. He said it would be fixed by March 4th.
Questioned Secretary Perdue at the Ag Committee today about the vaccine bank (one of my Farm Bill provisions), dairy, E-15 and conservation.
Elijah Cummings says it best at the Cohen hearing: ‚ÄúAs a country we are so much better than this.‚Äù 
This is a big moment. Now it's time for the Senate to take action on this bipartisan legislation to expand background checks.
A privilege to speak to the rare disease caucus today.... 
On Senate floor with where I just spoke about 1986 climate change letter signed by former Minnesota Republican Senator David Durenberger.  Back then climate was a bipartisan issue.  As the senators noted then, we must act soon.  Well that was 32 years ago. 
The Moscow Trump tower issue is real: Mr. Cohen acknowledged that he lied under oath to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, saying he was trying to protect Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúI am not protecting Mr. Trump anymore,‚Äù he said.  
This is even a bigger deal:  Cohen has alleged that Trump knew in advance that the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks planned to publish hacked Democratic National Committee emails. 
This is a big deal: Michael Cohen says President Trump was involved in a hush money scheme. He brought checks to Congress to prove it.‚Ä¶ 
At the Commerce Hearing on privacy and pushing the witnesses on the privacy bill I have with Senator Kennedy.  You got this right Amie! 
If a foreign government is backing a Facebook page, we should be able to know that. We also need to pass my Honest Ads Act to get disclaimers and disclosures on on-line paid political ads across all major platforms. 
We need to invest in our infrastructure again. It would bring good paying jobs, help us get goods to market, and make sure we're not sitting in traffic jams! 
This national emergency order is unconstitutional. 
Make no mistake: foreign adversaries will once again seek to interfere in the 2020 election. We must do everything we can to secure our elections before 2020. 
This is wrong and has been rightly condemned. To quote the American Jewish Committee, "[The views of Otzma Yehudit] do not reflect the core values that are the very foundation of the State of Israel."
Insulin has tripled in price since 2002, and it‚Äôs making diabetics sick with worry ‚Äî and just plain sick.Pharmaceutical companies must be held accountable.
The science on climate change is clear. What‚Äôs unclear is why the President is considering wasting taxpayer money to try and prove otherwise.
Thanks Sarah for your good work and for sharing what is happening in Georgia. Our democracy is run by us and if people can‚Äôt vote it isn‚Äôt our democracy! 
Congrats to U of M Gophers Women‚Äôs Hockey team! Regular season champs!   
And in New Hampshire, I talked with the about how we can win in 2020! If you're ready to join this team, sign up now:  
In South Carolina, we had a whole house full of people ready to get to work to move this country forward. This is what a homegrown campaign looks like (I promise I‚Äôm in that picture)! 
In Georgia, I sat down with leaders working to stop discriminatory voter suppression. We cannot allow the voices and votes of Americans to be stolen from them. And it was good to see and Jimmy Carter! 
In Iowa, I talked with people about about bridging the rural/urban divide at the sold out Ankeny Area Dems Winter Banquet. Because in the words of Paul Wellstone, ‚ÄúWe all do better when we all do better.‚Äù 
Over the last four days, we‚Äôve been to Iowa, Georgia, South Carolina, and New Hampshire ‚Äî and it has been an incredible journey.
Yes Lady Gaga! Great speech
Another packed house party ‚Äî this time in Concord, NH! Thank you to everyone who braved the winter weather to come be a part of this campaign. 
Rain or snow, we‚Äôre on the go. Great house party in New Hampshire today. 
Banks are making billions, while workers are losing out. It‚Äôs time for a tax policy that puts middle class families first. 
Long overdue recognition for trailblazer and inspiration, Katherine Johnson. Thank you for your tremendous contributions to science and our country.
When I say we're building a homegrown campaign, I mean it. Thank you to the hundreds of people who came out in Columbia, SC for our house party! 
I‚Äôve asked the Dept. of Education to immediately address the backlog of federal student loan forgiveness requests from borrowers who have been cheated or defrauded. Students should never have to worry about these scams as they look to improve their lives ; careers.
This move would devastate critical health care providers ‚Äî we must stand up and speak out. 
A must read. This should not be happening in the United States of America.
Great morning with the Greenville County Democratic Party! Thank you for the big and warm welcome to South Carolina. 
Wonderful lunch with Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter today at their home in Plains. Tomato soup and pimento cheese sandwiches! Got some good advice and helpful to hear about their grassroots presidential campaign (when no one thought they could win but they did)! 
The time for studying is over.  The time for action is here. The science is clear ‚Äî our world is warming. Instead of addressing it, the President has added a climate change skeptic to his panel to examine the impact warming is having on our planet. 
Good to be keynoting the first sold out event.  Had a great time and so impressed by the work you did in 2018 electing with more to come! Thanks and the rest of the team. Thanks !!! 
This is extremely concerning. Our adversaries tried to sow division in 2016 and undermine our democracy and it‚Äôs happening again. No matter which campaign is being targeted, we should all be on the side of working to prevent these hits from happening. 
During his nomination hearing, I asked Attorney General Barr to commit to releasing the Mueller findings. He did not. Now is the time to do the right thing. 
More proof that Sackler and Purdue Pharmaceutical made deliberate decision to hook people on OxyContin just to profit off their addiction.  Now they should pay for their treatment.  
As a former county attorney, I have seen the devastation caused by opioid abuse. My new bipartisan legislation with Senator Portman would require states to use prescription drug monitoring programs before prescribing powerful Rx drugs.
There‚Äôs no question about it ‚Äî the federal minimum wage must be increased to $15 an hour.
Prescription drug prices are out of control. We need to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies and bring costs down. 
Now more than ever it‚Äôs critical for Attorney General Barr to commit to releasing these findings to the public. 
Yep!
We know that immigrants do not diminish America. Immigrants are America. That's why we must pass comprehensive immigration reform. 
Thank you for sharing your story, Jodi. Together, I believe we can take on this crisis. 
No parent should have to worry about their child going to school and coming home safe. Americans need sensible gun safety legislation that works. 
Beautiful story about Mary Ann Feldman, who loved music and our orchestra and was so much fun. She was a friend of my dad‚Äôs and they got to see each other during the last few years.  via
Yesterday at the Town Hall in New Hampshire I talked about how the President repeatedly undermines the work of the Justice Department and our laws. Here‚Äôs the proof: Trump Has Publicly Attacked the Russia Investigation More Than 1,100 Times    
Thank you to Minnesota Attorney General and AG counterparts in 15 other states who are leading this effort. 
The American workforce is changing ; there isn‚Äôt just one path to success. There are good jobs that need to be filled ‚Äî we just need to create and expand apprenticeship and skills training programs to get people the right training. 
We need more participation in our democracy, not less. That‚Äôs why I want to pass a bill to automatically register every eligible person to vote when they turn 18. 
I got asked about national emergency declaration at last night‚Äôs town hall. It was probably my shortest answer of the night. 
WATCH: Amy talks about ‚Äúthat opportunity that is America.‚Äù 
If you liked what you heard at the  sign up for updates from Amy. This campaign is a homegrown one ‚Äî no political machine, no corporate PACs, and no federal lobbyists. To win, we'll need your help, so let's get to work:  
‚ÄúWe should join the majority of Americans‚Ä¶ and come together to pass common sense gun safety legislation.‚Äù ‚Äî Sen. Amy Klobuchar 
‚ÄúI believe that we must stand tall as a beacon of democracy. And we must stand with our allies.‚Äù ‚Äî Sen. Amy Klobuchar 
‚ÄúHow do you pay for [addiction recovery programs]? Well, I‚Äôve got a good start. And that is, why don‚Äôt we pay for it by getting money from the very drug companies that got people addicted in the first place.‚Äù ‚Äî Sen. Amy Klobuchar 
‚ÄúOn my first day as President, I will sign us back into the International Climate Agreement.‚Äù ‚Äî Sen. Amy Klobuchar 
‚ÄúWe have to govern from opportunity, not the chaos we‚Äôre seeing right now.‚Äù ‚Äî Sen. Amy Klobuchar 
Stopped by The Village Trestle in Goffstown, NH for a little pre  get-together.Well, maybe not so "little." 
I don‚Äôt have a political machine. I don‚Äôt come from money. But what I do have is this: I have grit. Join us today:  
I‚Äôve been saying for a long time that we need digital rules of the road. This report just proves why we need to move quickly in the United States to protect everyone‚Äôs privacy.
Stopped for supper at the Monroe County Democrats Annual Spaghetti Dinner ‚Äî cooked by my good friend 
In the Fargo Forum today by Jack Zaleski, former editorial page editor for the paper. ¬†I'm ready to get to work for all Americans.
Loved visiting with the Marion County Democrats today. We got to talk about what to do about rising drug prices, overturning Citizens United, farm issues, and more.Lots of delicious soup too! 
It looks like Abigail, John, and the snowwoman (me) brought the snow to Iowa! 
Universal background checks. Sensible gun safety legislation. It‚Äôs time, America: Police say Aurora attacker used gun he shouldn‚Äôt have owned 
Thank you to State Senator Amanda Ragan, JoAnn Hardy, and the Cerro Gordo Dems for the warm welcome. Thank you to Julie Bergo and her family for hosting us at Lorado‚Äôs. And thank you to everyone who waited for us in the overflow room! 
Made it south for the winter. Well, a little south to Mason City, Iowa! 
Thank you so much for your neighborly kindness, Wisconsin! I‚Äôm so grateful to the people of Eau Claire for coming out today. 
Thanks to everyone for turning out big time in Eau Claire!  My mom grew up in Wisconsin (still home to my Aunt Jane and Uncle Dick) and yes, we have a cheese making heritage in Monroe and beyond. To quote the Wisconsin motto ‚ÄúFORWARD!‚Äù 
Almost there and ready for Eau Claire!  (It rhymes). 
Governing from chaos once again (and this time at the expense of the Constitution, the Congress, the will of the people and...oh yes...our nation‚Äôs security needs): In Wielding Emergency Powers, Trump Paves a Dangerous Path Forward    
We are all thinking of those who lost loved ones in Aurora, Illinois today.  We remember that the victims went to work today just to do their jobs...as did the officers who put themselves right in the line of fire to save others.
States should not be able to purge ‚Äúinactive voters‚Äù from the voting rolls, an act that disproportionately hurts minority or low-income voters. My SAVE VOTERS Act with protects voting rights by ensuring that states cannot purge eligible voters. Let‚Äôs pass it.
Both sides of my family arrived in America with nothing but a suitcase, looking for a better life for their families. Their story isn‚Äôt so different from people working towards opportunity today.It‚Äôs past time for comprehensive immigration reform. 
Not getting what you want to fulfill a campaign promise/chant is not a national emergency.  Taking money from real needs and emergencies is what will create an actual emergency. 
Our government must be prepared to fight the threats of tomorrow, especially cyberwarfare.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve introduced new bipartisan legislation with Sen. Thune aimed at bringing more cybersecurity expertise to the federal workforce.
I put the digital revolution front-and-center in my announcement speech. From privacy to cybersecurity, this is a pressing public policy question that needs strong leadership.
We‚Äôve come a long way. Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day, John! 
We‚Äôre tired of being governed by chaos. The Congress has spoken on a bipartisan basis.  Not getting what you want to fulfill a campaign promise/chant is not a national emergency.
We must follow their example and get to work. There is a consensus in this country that we need commonsense gun safety legislation. I‚Äôm ready to work across the aisle to get it done.
On the anniversary of the Parkland shooting which claimed 17 lives, students everywhere are refusing to stay silent. Since that day, 1,200 kids have died from gun related violence. Students have written an obituary for every single one of them. 
My statement on AG nominee William Barr: 
Today we honor Rep. John Dingell ; fitting that it‚Äôs on Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Äîhe loved Debbie so very much ; also, of course, his country. As we say goodbye, I‚Äôm reflecting on his legacy of fighting for what‚Äôs right with a big smile ; a twinkle in his eye. He got a lot done that way.
I promise you this: As your President, I will look you in the eye. I will tell you what I think. I will focus on getting things done. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done my whole life.Join our team today:

Middle class families are seeing their tax refunds shrink, while big corporations and the very wealthy are still enjoying a huge tax cut. This was just one of the many tricks of the Republican tax bill and why I didn‚Äôt vote for it. 
Thank you for having me on And thank you for keeping your studio a little warmer than Boom Island. 
Your leaders should be accountable to you.We‚Äôre running this campaign the old-fashioned way, person-to-person and dollar-by-dollar.  
The Big Pharma companies think they own Washington.Well, they don‚Äôt own me. 
Yesterday, thousands of people came out in the snow and cold because they believed we can be a nation governed by opportunity. We're building a movement together, and we need you to join us:  
Thanks Preet...If only you‚Äôd seen the thousands of people and four big campfires and cocoa and cider and people arriving by sled and skis...we have a great team...More to come. 
I'm running for every parent, senior, worker, farmer, dreamer, and builder. I'm running for every American. 
Sat down with this morning to talk about my snowy announcement and what this homegrown campaign is all about. 
Watch this excerpt from Amy's epic speech.The cold didn't stop us. The snow didn't stop us. This is how we win. And follow this link to watch the whole speech:
