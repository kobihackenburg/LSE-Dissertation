I expect that a significant majority in Congress will share my skepticism of this agreement and vote it down.
This regime holds Americans hostage and has consistently violated every agreement it ever signed.
Pres Obama has consistently negotiated from a position of weakness, giving concessions to a regime that has American blood on its hands.

In the years ahead, it is my hope that each side will respect the dignity of the other.
...and a large number of Americans will be pleased with the Court‚Äôs decision today.
A large number of Americans will continue to believe in traditional marriage....
...and millions of Americans whose faiths hold a traditional view of marriage.
The next president and all in public office must strive to protect the First Amendment rights of religious institutions...
While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law.
This decision short-circuits the political process that has been underway on the state level for years.
That is the right of our people, not the right of the unelected judges or justices of the Supreme Court.
People who disagree with the traditional definition of marriage have the right to change their state laws.
...and should be between one man and one woman.
I believe that marriage, as the key to strong family life, is the most important institution in our society...

Today I released my foreign policy doctrine.Please click here now and watch the speech ; 
Read about my plan for Europe in the New American CenturyClick here to join me today: 
And because we will, the 21st century will be another American Century
And I believe America will continue to advance the cause of peace and freedom in our time.
I believe mankind remains afflicted, and that its destiny remains in our hands.
I believe America still has that genius.
Only American leadership will bring safety and enduring peace.
Protecting our people and their interests‚Ää‚Ää, ‚Ääis the highest honor, the greatest burden, and the most profound privilege
But increasingly in recent years, I‚Äôve also met people frustrated by the direction of American leadership.
I have seen American freedom and security play out in the lives of my parents, my children‚Ä¶ and myself.
It will reestablish a foreign policy based on strategy and principle rather than politics and polls.
This approach will restore American leadership to a world badly in need of it.
Those are the 3 pillars of my doctrine‚Ää-‚ÄäAmerican Strength, the protection of our global economy ; proud advocacy for America‚Äôs core values
In this century, we must restore America‚Äôs willingness to think big‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto state boldly what we stand for and why it is right.
America is the first power in history motivated by a desire to expand freedom rather than its own territory.
We must recognize that our nation is a global leader not just because it has superior arms, but because it has superior aims.
The third pillar of my doctrine is moral clarity regarding America‚Äôs core values.
In this century, businesses must have the freedom to operate around the world with confidence.
I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space.
Millions of the best jobs in this century will depend on international trade.
Now, in the 21st century, you can access global markets in a single second, with a tap on your smartphone.
The second pillar of my doctrine is the protection of the American economy in a globalized world.
So to restore American Strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military.
This is an idea that stems from a simple truth: the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest.
The first is American Strength.
My foreign policy doctrine consists of three pillars.
Today, I intend to offer such a doctrine. And in the coming years, I intend to be such a president.
One who will set forth a doctrine for the exercise of American influence in the world.
The 21st century requires a president who will answer that question with clarity and consistency.
What principles should govern the exercise of our power?
The question before us is not ‚Äúshould we lead?‚Äù but rather ‚Äúhow should we lead?‚Äù
We cannot bring about peace and stability on our own, but the world cannot do it without us.
The stakes of tomorrow are too high to look to the failed leadership of yesterday.
‚Ä¶ a leader from yesterday whose tenure as Secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst.
We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration‚Äôs foreign policy‚Ä¶
It is up to our next president to properly fund and modernize our military.
It is up to our next president to right the wrongs done by our current one.
I believe the onus of maintaining American Strength lies where the buck stops.
When we fail to lead with strength and principle, no other country, friend or foe, is willing or able to take our place.
We‚Äôve seen peaceful protestors met with violence from their governments.
We‚Äôve seen cyber-attacks against our allies and our own people.
We‚Äôve seen North Korea expand its nuclear arsenal and continue its brutal human rights violations.
We‚Äôve seen China rapidly expand its military capabilities and take aggressive action in the South and East China Seas.
We‚Äôve seen hundreds of thousands of Syrians slaughtered at the whim of a tyrant.
We‚Äôve seen ISIL sweep across multiple states, commit brutal atrocities, and attempt to establish a caliphate.
This deterioration of our physical and ideological strength has led to a world far more dangerous than when President Obama entered office.
President Obama has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.
He criticized America for having ‚Äúarrogance‚Äù and the audacity to ‚Äúdictate our terms‚Äù to other nations.
President Obama demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain.
He enacted hundreds of billions in defense cuts that left our Army on track to be at pre-World War II levels‚Ä¶
Today, as never before, foreign policy is domestic policy.
Turmoil across the world can impact American families almost as much as turmoil across town.
The prosperity of our people now depends on their ability to interact freely and safely in the international marketplace.
In recent decades, technology has demolished barriers of travel and trade, transforming our national economy into a global one.
Since the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American Strength has not.
And that weakness, on the other hand, is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace.
American Strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it.
‚Ä¶ eventually bringing about the conclusion of the Cold War and the emergence of America as the world‚Äôs only superpower.
The commitment to American Strength JFK spoke of lived on long after him‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääacross decades, across both parties‚Ä¶

And because we did, our children and theirs lived in a new American Century.
Because we did, the American miracle lived on.
The final verdict on our generation will be written by Americans not yet born. Let us make sure they record that we made the right choice.
But if we fail, they will be the first generation of Americans to inherit a country worse off than the one left for their parents.
If we can capture the promise of this new century they will be the freest and most prosperous Americans ever.
But I have chosen this course because this election is about them. Theirs is the most important generation in American history.
I will miss watching Amanda run track, Daniella play volleyball, Anthony play football and Dominick play soccer.
My wife Jeanette and my four children are here tonight. The next 19 months will take me far from home.
This will be the message of my campaign and the purpose of my presidency.
...But if they succeed, the 21st Century will be another American Century.
If their American Dreams become impossible, we will have become just another country.
That journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, is the essence of the American Dream.
My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room...so that tonight I could stand behind this podium in front of this room
When I was younger, I didn't fully appreciate all he did for us, but now as my own children grow older, I fully understand.
‚ÄúIn this country, you will achieve all the things we never could.‚Äù
"En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos."
Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as President.
I have heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn. But I cannot.
...as those who come from power and privilege.
I live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future...
... I announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America.
That is why today, grounded by the lessons of our history, and inspired by the promise of our future...
Before us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America.
But yesterday is over, and we are never going back.
Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday.

This election is not just about what laws we will pass. It is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be.
If America accepts the mantle of global leadership, by abandoning this admin‚Äôs dangerous concessions to Iran, and its hostility to Israel...
...then we will have a strong people and a strong nation.
...that all life deserves protection, and that all parents deserve to choose the education that‚Äôs right for their children...
If we remember that family ‚Äì not government ‚Äì is the most important institution in society...
If we do these things, the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs.
Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century.
While our people and economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, too many leaders and their ideas are stuck in the 20th century

But now, too many Americans are starting to doubt whether achieving that dream is still possible:
My parents achieved what came to be known as the American Dream.
They never made it big. But they were successful.
But because they were not born into wealth or power, their future was destined to be defined by their past.
When they were young, my parents had big dreams for themselves.
Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this.
Most people who have ever lived were trapped by circumstances of birth, destined to live the life their parents had. America is different.
I am more confident than ever that despite our troubles, we have it within our power to make our time another American Century
I chose to make this announcement at the Freedom Tower because it is a symbol of our nation‚Äôs identity as the land of opportunity.
After deliberation ; prayer about the future of our country, I have come here to make an announcement on how I believe I can best serve her.
