 Today, I’m proud to release my latest  plan, Growing Rural Prosperity. Because in addition to Trump’s chaos…
 Presidential hopeful just released a rural policy plan. It would:• Transform federal crop insurance• Pay farm…
 It can't be said enough, the only way we tackle the climate crisis is by leaving no one behind. latest plan does…
Here’s the truth: Defeating climate change is going to take every single one of us. And that includes farmers and rural communities. 
 Just when you thought climate policies couldn't get more comprehensive...they throw another few dozen page…
US farmers have long fed and led the world in agricultural production and innovation. It’s about time we start looking out for these communities again. 
“At the end of the day, this and [Inslee's] other plans taken together offer a sharp, clear vision of what the U.S. could look like if it got serious about combatting climate change and protecting citizens.”  
What’s happening in the  — the planet’s lungs — affects all of us. Once, American leadership might have helped stop this tragedy. But Trump doesn’t care. And his ego-driven foreign-policy-by-tweet has utterly debased our credibility on the international stage.
“Governor Inslee’s plan... creates new ways for government to partner with producers that promises better incomes for farmers and ranchers and better outcomes for the environment." - Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack

 Jay Inslee completes climate change policy proposals with plans aimed at agriculture  
 is exactly right. Union workers built America. It’s time to stand up to corporations and put workers back at the heart of our economy.  
You have laid the groundwork for this achievement. You brought attention to an issue that had been pushed to the back burner for too long. This is a victory for the climate movement — and I thank you for your work.
 Wow,  plan is one everyone should read.  Integrates smart land-use, farming revenue enh…
Trump’s approach to the climate crisis is worse than benign neglect. His hallucination about Greenland, where 11 billion tons of ice melted in one day last week, shows he wants to profit from other’s misery at the hands of the climate crisis. 
Read my plan here: 
My Growing Rural Prosperity Plan is based on 4 strategies: 1️⃣ Investing in agricultural innovations to defeat climate change2️⃣ Keeping farmers farming 3️⃣ Investing in rural prosperity and advancing equity4️⃣ Improving forest health and protecting America’s public lands
My latest  plan is about taking on the climate crisis in agriculture — but it’s also about protecting farmworker rights, expanding rural broadband, protecting our public lands, and improving the lives of rural communities. 
Today, I’m proud to release my latest  plan, Growing Rural Prosperity. Because in addition to Trump’s chaos trade agenda and agribusiness consolidation, rural America faces the deep and unprecedented existential threat of climate change.

22/ There are so many people who have helped us get where we are today. I couldn’t thank everyone by name, but know that I appreciate every single person who has made our  possible. Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and organize. Let's go get ‘em.
21/ And yesterday, on August 19, we hit the 130,000 donor threshold. It’s clearer than ever: Climate activists can no longer be ignored. I’m honored and humbled by the incredible surge of support we’ve seen over the last few weeks. Thank you. 
20/ On August 6, we released an aggressive plan to address both white nationalism and gun violence in America. A huge thank you to and for helping us make sure we got this critical plan exactly right.
19/ That week, I went back to the 48217 community as well as Flint, Michigan to release my Community Climate Justice Plan. This plan is based on conversations with and what we learned from Theresa and the other 48217 community leaders. 
18/ Right before the second debate, the Muslim community was kind enough to welcome me to the Islamic Center of Detroit. Muslim people make our country stronger, and I’m thankful to leaders in Detroit taking the time to talk with me.  
17/ Supporting teachers is personal to me, and I wanted our education plan to improve the lives of students and teachers alike. To do this, I got to work closely with educators and advocates like and and the WA Education Association.
16/ Before the first debate, I met with community members in Little Haiti to talk about how climate change is fueling gentrification and pushing people out of their neighborhoods.Thank you to everyone there who took the time to tell me their stories. 
15/ It was inspiring to meet Theresa, the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, and all the community activists working to build a better future for Detroit and the 48217 community. 
 14/ In early June, I visited Detroit and the 48217 community — the most polluted zip code in Michigan, thanks to the dirty tar sands oil processed nearby. There, I met inspiring leaders like Theresa Landrum. 
13/ We collaborated with many groups to get this plan right. A big thank you to and all the groups who helped us make it happen!
12/  Throughout May, we released some incredible policy proposals, but I especially enjoyed working with immigrant and worker rights groups as we created a plan to overhaul our immigration system and make sure it’s humane, efficient, and just. 
11/ In May, I visited Davenport, IA. Like Hamburg, the town was devastated by record-breaking floods. But the destruction we saw was matched only by the determination of its residents to recover.   
 Thank you for taking our generation’s future seriously 🌍You’ve shown the public that the  is no…
In movies, climate change is near-universally used as a plot device for sacrifice or doom. But storytellers in Hollywood should remember that stories about climate change can change public consciousness about clean energy and sow hope. 
10/ I am so inspired by him and the climate justice leaders we’ve met across the US. Thank you.
9/ Later in April, I had the honor of meeting Harold Mitchell in South Carolina. Harold is standing up to big polluters and fighting for the wellbeing of people in his community. 
8/ The people there showed great courage and resilience. I’m more convinced than ever they deserve a president with the courage to act on climate. 
 7/ In April, we traveled to Hamburg, Iowa where record-breaking floods had left many people without heat and drinkable water for weeks. 
 6/ I want to give a special thank you to who I had the honor of striking with outside the in May. At just 14 years old, she is a powerful force for good and an unstoppable leader in the climate movement. 
5/ Throughout this campaign, I have been inspired by the tireless work of young people fighting for a better future — including and more.
4/ On March 15, I went on  in New York City with young people from around the country. 
3/ Early in March, we visited Agoura Hills, CA where I met Marsha Maus. Marsha’s home was completely destroyed by the Woolsey Fire, which was made worse by climate change. Thank you to Marsha and the people of Agoura Hills for sharing your stories with me. 
2/ I want to take some time to talk about how far we’ve come since we launched on March 1 — and to introduce you to some of the incredible people we’ve met and who have helped get us to where we are today.  
1/ At 7‌:03 am ET on Mar‌ch 1, Amy from New York became our first donor. Last night, Linda from Kentucky chipped in, too. Between Amy and Linda, 129,998 people (and now more) have invested in this campaign. I’m honored. Thank you.

8/ Just last month, Trump said four congresswomen of color should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”
7/ In January 2018, Trump said America did not want immigrants from “s—hole countries” like Haiti and African nations. 
6/ In August 2017, a man drove his car into a group of counter-protestors at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, VA, killing Heather Heyer and injuring dozens more. Trump said there were “very fine people, on both sides.”
5/ Within a week of taking office, Trump instated a Muslim ban — an executive order to block “foreign terrorist entry.” The ban is blatantly discriminatory and wrong. 
4/ In the same speech he announced he was running for president, Trump said about Mexican people: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” 
 3/ For years, Trump led the racist birther movement, lying about President Obama’s citizenship in an attempt to ingratiate himself with the far-right.

This is exactly why the next president must make defeating the climate crisis the number one priority of the United States. 
America needs a cohesive approach to address the interrelated epidemics of white nationalism and gun violence — and that starts with presidential leadership.
 What's dangerous, is believing you can sit down to tea with Mitch McConnell and “work it out.” 
Climate change is in my backyard. It impacts all of us, in one way or another. That’s why we must all come together to defeat this crisis.

What's dangerous, is believing you can sit down to tea with Mitch McConnell and “work it out.” 
Majority Leader Harry Reid knows Mitch McConnell. He knows we can't sit down to tea with the self-proclaimed "grim reaper" to pass the bold climate legislation the science demands. We must end the filibuster.

Now it’s 2019 and I’m running for president because we owe it to our kids to fight for their future. I want to be able to look at my kids and grandkids in the eye and tell them I did everything I could to defeat the climate crisis.  
Since 2013, I’ve proudly served as governor of Washington. And we’ve accomplished a lot, like: ✅ The nation’s best 100% clean energy bill ✅ The first state public option✅ A strong paid family leave policy  
And of course, I’ve been committed to fighting climate change throughout my career. Here I am in 2006, urging my fellow members of Congress to pull their heads out of the sand.  
In 1993, I voted against the Hyde Amendment. And in Washington, I’ve made sure we not only protect reproductive freedom — but that we expand it. 
 I'm talking to and tonight on Hardball. Tune in. 
While I was in Congress, I cast many votes that I was proud of. I voted against and vocally opposed the Iraq War. And I know we cannot allow the Trump administration to thrust us into another disastrous war in the Middle East today.

In 1994, I cast a critical vote in favor of an assault weapons ban. I know it would probably cost me my seat in Congress, and it did. But I don’t regret it. It was the right vote then and it’s the right vote now.  
I served in the state legislature, and then ran for the House in ‘92. My campaign brochure read, “Jay Inslee stands for protecting our children’s future environment by insisting on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere.”  
Trudi and I raised our 3 boys — Jack, Connor, and Joe — in rural eastern Washington. I first got into public service to fight for a new public high school in my town.

I met my high school sweetheart, Trudi, in Spanish class when we were 15 years old. We’ve been married for 47 wonderful years this month. Here we are at prom.

It is incumbent on all of us – candidates, members of the media, and Americans – to call this president what he is: a white nationalist.
When given a chance to condemn white nationalism, Donald Trump used the moment as an opportunity to call for immigration reform. Let me be clear: scapegoating immigrants for the actions of a white supremacist is unacceptable.
It’s time for Donald Trump to take ownership for his encouragement of hate and violence in America.From hateful chants at his rallies, to racist tweets, to praise for white nationalists, this president has done more to divide the United States than any leader in modern history.
 I agree. We should start by getting you and your white nationalism out of the White House.

We are not helpless and things are not hopeless. Our fight to end gun violence continues — as long as it takes.
It’s been a hard weekend for our country, especially for the people of Texas and Ohio. If you’re looking for something to do right now, consider supporting groups like the Alliance for Gun Responsibility
Here’s what’s clear, simple, and wrong: You’re owned by the NRA. Grow a spine, Senator. 
 We cannot and will not end gun violence in America without ending the filibuster. 
We cannot and will not end gun violence in America without ending the filibuster. 
You’ve heard it said when it comes to terrorism: if you see something, say something. So I’m saying something. This president has to stop emboldening white nationalism. He is actively endangering American lives. 
Today, America woke up to the second mass shooting in 24 hours. This is a crisis — and a crisis of leadership. We can’t wait one more day to stand up to the NRA and pass commonsense gun laws.

To defeat the climate crisis, we must transition our economy off fossil fuels to an economy run on clean energy and that begins with rejecting new fossil fuel infrastructure.
Minnesota families deserve that we put their health and clean water above Enbridge Energy's corporate profits. Line 3 should be decommissioned as soon as possible and the permitting process for the proposed replacement should not move forward.

As president, I will accept historic numbers of refugees – because we need to live up to the promises of diversity, equality, and inclusion that our nation was founded on. Refugees make our nation stronger and more vibrant. 
I am proud to welcome refugees and immigrants to Washington state as governor, and to have been the first governor to speak out against the Muslim ban. I have shown in my state that we are stronger when we embrace immigrants. 
When Donald Trump threatened to place refugees in states like mine that oppose his ugly immigration policies, I said that is not a threat to me. 
We must restore the American dream for asylum seekers and refugees, who are looking for safety, security, and possibility, just like generations of new Americans before them.
Immigrants and refugees built America and helped define our national identity.  History has never been kind to those who reject refugees in their moment of need. President Trump's hateful rhetoric and xenophobic policies bring back memories of our darkest times.
I never thought I'd see an American president consider a proposal to end refugee admissions. This plan is fundamentally un-American, and it would undoubtedly lead to more deaths and trauma for refugees.

As Donald Trump continues to lie about his environmental record, remember that he and his administration have been caught repeatedly censoring climate out of official reports. 
Climate change is an existential threat, and there's just no way to deal with climate change without getting rid of the filibuster. You cannot allow an arcane, antiquated procedure to block progress.

We’ve come so far since we launched this campaign in March. And we’ve met so many incredible people. I’m more convinced than ever: We can defeat the climate crisis — and we will, together.

 "It is imperative that we invest in building an American clean energy future, and defeat climate change with good-paying…
9/ When the Democratic debates come to Michigan later this month, the Enbridge Line should be a major topic. I hope that every fellow Democratic candidate for president joins me in opposing this dangerous pipeline.  
8/ I want to thank all of the groups fighting to protect their Great Lakes and our climate from the dangerous Line 5 oil pipeline. 
7/ And my Evergreen Economy Plan shows how we will create 8 million good, family-wage and union jobs building a more just, innovative and inclusive clean energy economy.  
6/ My Freedom from Fossil Fuels Plan clearly articulates how America can and must reject projects like the Line 5 pipeline and tunnel, and transition our nation off of fossil fuels.  
5/ Already the clean energy sector employs three times more American workers than those that work in fossil fuels – and four time as many in the Midwest. 
4/ It is imperative that we invest in building an American clean energy future, and defeat climate change with good-paying jobs that grow clean energy industries. But to do this, we must reject the dirty fossil fuel projects of the past. 
3/ This dangerous pipeline must be decommissioned, the proposed oil tunnel must not be built, and clean alternatives must be explored immediately. 
2/ And they would lock in decades of climate pollution that we can’t afford. Line 5 is a 66 year old pipeline that was built to last only 50 years, but that still uses Michigan and the Great Lakes as a short cut to deliver Canadian oil to Canadians. 
1/ The Enbridge  pipeline, and the proposed oil tunnel to replace it, are a clear and present threat to the health of the Great Lakes and to our climate. They threaten the clean drinking water that millions depend upon. 
 Fossil fuel infrastructure is dirty, dangerous, and poses a threat to our communities. Today, I’m announcing my opposition t…

Betsy DeVos has made our schools less equitable, less safe, and less effective. I have a plan that puts an end to that. 
Here are the facts: The  puts justice and equity at its center. If we don’t  people of color and low-income communities will continue to be hit the hardest.
What will hurt communities on the frontline of the climate crisis is the Trump administration’s continued inaction on climate. 
Donald Trump is lying when he says he’s been a champion for the environment. In reality, he’s been a disaster for it. We need a leader and not a liar in the Oval Office. 
Since Trump didn’t answer this question (or any other): Wind turbines don’t cause cancer — they cause jobs. 
Trump says we have the cleanest air and water in the world. I think many people I met in Michigan might strongly disagree. 
The climate crisis is a political problem for Donald Trump and he knows it. 
  TRUE. 
As Trump touts his administration’s environmental “accomplishments,” a reminder that the EPA is run by a coal lobbyist, Interior is run by an oil lobbyist and Energy is run by someone who wanted to abolish the department.
Read my plan here: 
It’s no surprise that Trump doesn’t understand the  He recklessly pulled us out of the accord. I’ll rejoin Paris on Day One of my administration —  and we must not only rejoin it but strengthen it, too.
This is a false choice. The fastest-growing jobs in this country are in clean energy. In Washington state, we have the fastest-growing economy and the strongest environmental rules in the country. 
Trump says his administration has made the environment a priority since day one. That’s true — they’ve made it a priority to destroy it. 
Donald Trump's speech will be filled with lies: He’s done as much to help the environment as the Continental Army did to secure our airports.

When we protect voting rights, we protect our democracy. The Supreme Court has ruled it will not stop partisan gerrymandering. States must fight back against voter suppression -- just like we have in Washington.
The climate policies we’ve released have been called the “gold standard.” And we’re not done yet. Help us create more robust plans that envision a better future for all of us.

When we invest in education, we’re investing in a better world for all of us.

To rise to the challenge of defeating climate change, America must train a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, tradespeople, and more. We must improve and invest in our education system. 
Half of American workers haven’t had a raise in 20 years. We must make an American economy that works for everyone — just like we have in Washington state. 
 Thank you Governor for visiting the caucus meeting this morning at  
 Coming up: on CNN from convention. Will talk about his new education plan out this AM. 
Betsy DeVos is a dangerous ideologue committed to dismantling the public education system. The next president must fulfill America’s fundamental promise of a high-quality, safe, equitable education for all.  
We must deliver on the promise of equitable and accessible public education for all. My plan will: ✅Increase teacher pay ✅Provide free and low-cost public college for families in need ✅Create universal preschool for all, and more 
I grew up in a family of educators — including my dad, Frank, who was a high school biology teacher and coach. I know how important it is to invest in teachers and students. Today, I’m proud to release my Ready for the Future education plan:  
“With smart policies that truly value the economic and societal benefits of renewable power, we can accelerate the transition to a renewable energy economy and provide Americans the clean energy future they deserve.”
We must hold big polluters accountable for the catastrophic damage they have done to our planet and our communities. 
Trudi and I wish everyone a happy and safe Fourth of July! Today marks 243 years since the Declaration of Independence was signed and our democracy started to take shape. Today and every day, we must commit ourselves to making a stronger, more just democracy for all of us.
I’m extremely proud that this great American calls Washington state home.

The cost of the climate crisis is sky high — and polluters must be held accountable. My Freedom from Fossil Fuels Plan makes sure of it. 
Health care is a top issue for voters — and while I’ve been governor of my state, we’ve made huge strides in improving health care for everyone. That includes the nation’s first public option, generous paid family medical leave, and more. 
I'll protect our national parks and make defeating climate change our nation's top priority. Chip in today:

We can make it to the top together! 🚴🏻‍♂️ Help us hit 130,000 donors and guarantee that climate change gets the attention it needs during the fall debates:  
Since he didn’t caption it, I will: This is the president of the United States legitimizing a ruthless dictator for the purpose of a photo op. 
This is exactly why we need to hold big polluters accountable and aggressively transition the US economy off of fossil fuels. My Freedom from Fossil Fuels Plan does exactly that.

What and are doing to move the needle on climate change is nothing short of incredible. 
Last week while we were in Florida, I met with community members in Little Haiti to talk about how climate change is fueling gentrification and pushing people out of their neighborhoods. This is what I mean when I say climate change is not one issue — it’s every issue. 
 We must be ambitious. We must be bold. We must defeat the climate crisis. 
Thanks to the progressive grassroots, climate activists, and Democrats across the country, we are one step closer to giving climate change the attention it requires in this race.  
We must defeat Donald Trump in order to defeat the climate crisis. There is no time to waste.

 "We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last who can do something about it." —
We need a president who will make defeating climate change the number one priority of the United States. It will be the organizing principle of my entire administration. I am the only candidate making that commitment, and nothing less can achieve this goal.  
Our towns are burning, our fields are flooded, and our coastlines are inundated. This isn’t a problem — it’s a crisis, and we need to defeat it before it’s too late.   
It’s delusional to think think McConnell will sit down at tea and solve climate change. We need a bold, ambitious vision for clean energy — and we must eliminate the filibuster to implement that vision. There is no time for middle ground approaches.

It’s long past time to save lives from preventable gun violence — and I will stand up to anyone to do it.  
I voted to ban assault weapons in 1994. I lost my seat in Congress because of it, but I want to tell you this: I have never regretted that vote. Not for one second.   
In Washington state, I’m proud we’ve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini ICE agents. I was the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump’s heinous Muslim ban.   
Under my watch, Washington had become a national leader on gun safety — and we’ve got the on the run. We’ve closed the background check loophole, banned untraceable guns, and made it harder for criminals to get weapons.

I am the only candidate who has passed a public option. And I respect everyone’s goals and plans here. But we do have one candidate who has advanced the ball.   
 "We welcome refugees in our state. We welcome diversity as a strength. That's how we built America." - 
 "We recognize diversity as a strength, that is how we built America" -  
I saw this in the Iraq War. I spoke up vocally and persistently about trying to beat the drums of war to get us into a conflict, and I’ve seen the people who were injured and families who lost loved ones as a result. We cannot allow that to happen again.  
We must always stay committed to the national security of the United States, but Americans are now justifiably concerned that the same people that caused the Iraq War debacle will repeat it by causing an unnecessary conflict with Iran.  
We must restore America’s moral leadership on immigration by welcoming historic levels of refugees to the United States, creating pathways to citizenship and addressing the root causes of family migration— including climate change.  
 YES! Thank you, 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  
The climate crisis can’t be ignored this election. And I promise I won’t let it be. Chip in now and make sure I’m on the stage for every debate.   
The people who brought us the weekend, unions, are going to bring us a long overdue raise in America. And I’m proud of standing up for unions.   
If elected, I will use my First 100 Days to rescind  the Muslim ban, end Trump’s wall, protect DREAMers, and restore humanity to our immigration system.  
America’s immigration system needs an overhaul. Donald Trump’s cruelty and rhetoric is making the problem even worse.  
If elected, I will repeal the Hyde Amendment once and for all, ensure national Reproductive Parity - like we have here in Washington - and enshrine the right to abortion as a civil right.

Thanks for letting me tell you a little bit about Jay and our story. I hope you’ll tune in to the debate tonight — and join us in the fight to defeat climate change. We can and must do this. - TI   
 Hi everyone! I’m Trudi Inslee. Tonight is the big night! I’m taking over for Jay here on Twitter because, as you might guess…
Jay has done so in our state and will do it for the rest of our country. - TI
As we defeat climate change, we can create millions of good, union jobs. We can provide affordable education with well-paid teachers, provide access to health care for all, protect immigrants, and enact gun safety legislation. - TI

Defeating climate change has to be the top priority of the next administration. Pretty darn simple. If we don’t, nothing else matters. We have a moral responsibility to leave a safe and healthy environment for future generations. This cannot wait. - TI
From 1998 until 2012, Jay served in Congress again. And since 2013, he’s been governor of Washington. Together, we decided he should run for president because we want to do everything we can to solve the climate crisis. - TI
Ever since Jay lost his seat, I’ve been passionate about sensible gun safety legislation. I also believe every child deserves a safe place to call home and a great education so I’ve focused on ending youth homelessness and providing more early learning opportunities.- TI 
In ‘92, Jay was elected to the US House of Representatives. He knew he might lose his seat if he voted for a ban on assault weapons in ‘94. It was the right vote, he did lose his seat, but he’s never regretted it for a minute. - TI 
Here are a few photos of the family campaigning for Jay’s reelection in 1990. The boys and I have always been really proud of their dad. - TI 

When my mom first met Jay, she told him, “You should go into politics.” We just laughed at the time. Turns out, she was right. Jay first ran for the Washington House of Representatives in 1988. - TI 
Here’s Jay sledding with our grandson. It’s little moments like this. - TI 
We’re also delighted to have two grand-pups and two grand-cats! - TI 
Our best memories are of doing ordinary things with our boys Jack, Connor, and Joe. They’re grown and married, so now we have 3 daughters (their spouses), 3 grandchildren, and 1 more arriving in December. - TI 
Here’s Jay with his dad at our son Jack and daughter-in-law Megan’s wedding in 2001. Frank had a great sense of humor. We miss him. - TI 
Caring about the environment is in Jay’s DNA. His favorite childhood memories are of exploring the tide pools with his dad, Frank, who taught biology. And now he loves to explore the beach with our grandkids - TI 
Jay is also the one who introduced me to hiking. I remember thinking, “Why am I wearing a pack and heading uphill?” Here we are with his mom, Adele and brother, Todd near Mt. Rainier in the ‘70’s - TI 
Even though photo doesn’t show it, our wedding day by Green Lake was a perfect August blue sky day in Seattle. I was the sixth in family to wear my grandmother’s dress. Jay wore a new polyester suit. We had cake and punch in the church basement. - TI 
 Thank you, Trudi! It's so nice to see you!I'll be watching w excitement tonight, as I believe that Jay is the…
We return to the water as often as we can. Nothing better than leaning on a log and listening to the waves. (By the way, he still has this hat!) - TI 
Jay and I met in Spanish class when we were 15 years old. For our first date, we went water skiing on Lake Washington. He was a pro. It took me awhile. (And here we are at prom.) - TI 
Hi everyone! I’m Trudi Inslee. Tonight is the big night! I’m taking over for Jay here on Twitter because, as you might guess, he’s pretty busy getting ready for the  I want to tell you a little about the man I’ve been married to for the last (almost) 47 years.

A lot of people are wondering how I’m preparing for the debate tomorrow. I’m in Miami, listening to people on the frontlines of the climate crisis.  
 NOW: Gov. on MSNBC
We will end the gravy train of fossil fuel subsidies and invest that money into building a clean energy economy. We must stop giving away our taxpayer dollars to corporations that pollute our air and water and fuel the climate crisis.   
 That’s it from me. I hope you’ll tune in to see Jay at the debate tomorrow at 6 PM PT/9 PM ET. I know how excited he is to get to share his vision with America. - 
 I’m proud to work for this campaign and for Jay. And tomorrow, when he’s on the debate stage, the rest of the country is going to see exactly what I see every day: Why he should be our next president. - AK 
 If you want to see more plans like the ones we’ve already put together, donate now. Because we’re just getting started. - AK  
 This campaign has come so far since we launched in March. We’ve released four robust plans that map out exactly how the United States can defeat climate change. Who else can say that? No one. - AK
 Hey all. I’m Aisling Kerins, campaign manager here on  I’ve been with the Gov for a long time — and while he’s in d…
 On the night of the town hall, my daughter Hannah said, “That’s the president my mom works for! Jay Inslee.” - AK
 Like I said, I’ve worked with Jay for a long time. Running a presidential campaign with two small kids seemed challenging (to say the least) but the Gov said “Bring the kids. We’ll make it all work.” - AK 
 Beryl was the first person to fly solo, nonstop across the Atlantic from east to west. Jay drew it three times because he didn’t like how the first ones turned out. He gave it to me with a note about powerful women leading the way. - AK
 Something a lot of people don’t know about Jay is that he’s a really great artist (he calls himself a “doodler”). He made me this drawing a few weeks ago. It’s of Beryl Markham. - AK  
 And you see that. Like when he voted against the Iraq War and for the '94 Assault Weapons Ban (which cost him his congressional seat). The decisions he makes aren't easy — because as governor, any decision you’re making is likely a tough one. - AK 
 Jay is thoughtful about making decisions as a leader. He’s very cognizant of the impact his decisions have on people’s lives. He’s always focused on making the right decision, not the popular one. - AK
 If you want a candidate who will make defeating climate change the number one priority, consider chipping in and helping power this campaign. - AK 
 Have to share: Here’s when Jay and Trudi met my youngest daughter, Tabitha, for the first time. - AK 
 When the Gov talks about wanting to be able to tell his grandkids he did everything he could to defeat climate change, he really means it. And that’s how all of us feel — it’s what drives this campaign forward. - 
 And just look at everything he’s accomplished in the last 6 years! The nation’s best 100% clean energy bill, the first state public health care option, free college for families in need… The list goes on and on. -
I never envisioned myself working for a candidate. But it was so clear to me early on that Jay was different. So, years later, I worked on Jay’s first campaign for governor, and then I managed his reelection campaign in 2016. -
 Launching my twitter with this  original. Welcome to Miami!  
Here’s a photo from when he was a congressman and I presented him with an award for being a Public Interest Champion. - AK

It’s time to take on big polluters. Watch live as I release my Freedom from Fossil Fuels plan. 
Just like big tobacco, fossil fuel companies have lied to Americans for decades. And we’re the ones paying the price. That’s unacceptable — and I have a plan to put an end to it. Watch my livestream here at 11 AM ET as I announce my Freedom from Fossil Fuels plan. 
To defeat climate change, we need a president that isn’t afraid to take on big polluters and hold them accountable. And that’s exactly what I’m going to do. Tune in live today at 11 am ET for a special announcement.
 Nonsense. Never enough pictures of clouds. They’re incredible. Get it,
I’m not afraid to take on big polluters. This moment and this mission to defeat climate change demands that we do. 
I refuse to leave our kids and grandkids with a world ruined by climate change. We have a moral responsibility to defeat this crisis.
Coal workers are dedicated, hard-working people. They deserve our honesty and our support. In Washington, we’re taking care of coal workers — we must do that across the United States. 
The fastest-growing job in America is solar panel installer. The second fastest-growing? Wind turbine technician. There’s no denying that clean energy is the future of jobs. 
Denying the urgency of the climate crisis is denial too
Dangerous and irresponsible. We need an administration that will take the climate crisis seriously. 
I want to build an economy American workers can depend on and one that will defeat climate change. 
 I’m going to hand it back over to the Gov now. Thanks for reading along, and I hope to see you on the trail! - Alex  
 I’m proud to work for this campaign and to meet so many inspiring people on the trail. I really believe in this mission, and if you want to see more from us, I hope you’ll donate before the debates. - AF 
 Here are and posing with Honest Abe before milkshakes. - AF 
 The Gov also has to try the local milkshake spot, wherever we go. Someone told him about this place that had milkshakes named after presidents, and that’s that. He says we’re rerouting to the milkshake spot. - AF
 The Gov will be late to meetings because of it! It makes my life harder sometimes, but it’s also really cute. - AF
 My time on this takeover is almost up. But I want to tell you one more story from the road. Without fail, every single trip, Jay sends a postcard to his wife, Trudi. - AF
 On the spot in CA, no questions asked, the Gov jumped into the rally and spoke to the students. It was incredible to see a candidate make time to talk to these young leaders — at the expense of rubbing shoulders with people at the convention. - AF 
 The Gov has always been inspired by the young people striking and demanding a  We’ve attended strikes from Las Vegas to New York. - AF 
 While we were at the California Democratic Convention a few weeks ago, Maggie  ran into some of the organizers of a youth  rally outside the convention. - AF
 But Jay Inslee is not your regular candidate. And there’s never been a campaign like this — one that puts defeating climate change right at its center. If you believe in that, like I do, chip in now. - AF 
 This trip was meaningful for a lot of reasons, but maybe the biggest of all is that presidential candidates don’t do trips like this. Many people we met that day told us that a candidate had never taken the time to hear their community’s story. - AF 
 Jay also met with Valerie Jean, whose neighborhood was without water for days after the city shut it off. Her 86-year-old neighbor went without it for 11 days and never recovered. - AF 
 The Gov met with Theresa Landrum who, alongside her neighbors, is standing up to powerful corporate and fossil fuel interests. These people need a president who isn’t afraid to stand up, either. - AF 
 One of the neighborhoods we went to is right next to the Marathon Refinery —  and thanks to the dirty tar sands oil refined there, this “fenceline” community is considered to be the most polluted zip code in Michigan.- AF
 In Detroit, Jay and the team spent the day with environmental justice leaders and frontline communities, and heard stories about how fossil fuels are affecting their day-to-day lives. - AF 
 Since we kicked off this campaign in March, we’ve met with so many incredible people across the country. One of the trips that stands out to me most was when we went to Detroit.  - AF
Hey all. Alex  here. The Gov is busy getting ready for the debates this week, so I’m taking over here on Twitter. I want to tell you about some of the inspiring people we’ve met on the road the last few months. 
That’s the end of my takeover! Thanks for letting me tell you about how we’re building big, bold plans that drive this country forward.  -
Like the Gov, I want to be able to say we did everything possible to preserve human civilization from this catastrophe. Because it is worth it. - GP 
Jay Inslee is the only candidate who truly gets it. He’s the only one who understands what we need to do to defeat climate change and preserve our way of life. - GP
We’re passionate about putting together robust plans like these because we know: The next president must launch a full-scale mobilization of this country to defeat climate change. That’s what this all adds up to. - GP 
These plans make it clear: Jay Inslee isn’t just looking at how to do something around the edges. He wants to figure out how to accomplish big progressive wins that move the country forward. - GP
 When we create the policies on our campaign, we think about a couple different things: 1. Who are the people impacted?; 2. How can we build on the success the Gov has had in WA?; and 3. Where can our policies do the most good? - GP
 There’s no doubt about it: Donors like you have made it possible for us to develop robust, meaningful plans like this. If you want to see more plans from our team, chip in now. - GP 
 It’s a plan to rebuild American leadership through climate mobilization. That’s revolutionary. - GP 
 But we weren’t done yet (and we still aren’t, by the way). Just a few weeks ago, we released our Global Climate Mobilization Plan — the first-ever foreign policy plan that puts climate change right at the center. - GP
 I was really proud of this plan because it got a lot of recognition for its intersectionality. At the end of the day, it’s a plan that reflects the fact that all of us deserve justice and opportunity. - GP
 Hey everyone. I’m part of the policy team here on  I’m taking over the Gov’s Twitter account this…
 Then, at the end of May, we put together our immigration plan, America’s Promise. In Washington state, we know that immigrants strengthen and enrich our communities. This plan is built on that.  - GP
 I thought this headline summed it up best. Because the Gov wants to defeat climate change, of course, but he’s also passionate about making sure we look out for America’s workers. We can create good, family-wage jobs and build a clean energy economy. - GP 
 Next, we released the Evergreen Economy Plan. It's a roadmap to put this country back to work, including the communities and workers who have relied on fossil fuel jobs. It’s a real, just transition.  - GP 
 Consider it done.
 The Governor’s vision is the only one that ends a practice that we simply can no longer afford: burning coal. As the Gov likes to say, it’s a big and bold plan for a big and bold nation. - GP
  and I have worked with the Gov to build the policy plans you’ve seen him release in the last several weeks. Our first was the 100% Clean Energy for America Plan. - GP  
 This is a leader who knows how to get things done. Period. - GP
 It’s a crowded field — believe me, we know. But the Gov is uniquely qualified to be president because he has led a state that is at the front of the pack. That’s true on climate, yes, but it’s also true on investments in family, in workers, in health care. - GP
 I guess a good place to start would be to tell you why I joined the Gov’s team. I know this: Climate change must be the number one priority of the next president. And I know that we must mobilize the entire US economy to meet this challenge and revitalize our country. - GP
 Over the next couple of days, you’re going to be hearing from a few of us on Team Jay. Tomorrow, you’ll hear from Alex Fujinaka  who’s going to tell you about some of the inspiring people we’ve met on the road. - GP
Hey everyone. I’m part of the policy team here on  I’m taking over the Gov’s Twitter account this afternoon because I want to tell you about how we’re translating Washington state’s success into a vision for a better America for all of us. 
Our success in Washington state proves this: We can defeat the climate crisis and build a strong economy that looks out for its workers.  
Maxine, thank you for sharing your story and leading this fight. Reproductive rights are human rights. It’s just that simple.  
We have a beautiful country — but it is marred by racial disparity in our criminal justice system. We need to bring more justice to our justice system.

I voted to ban assault weapons, I did lose my seat, and I want to tell you this: I have never regretted that vote for one second. Not one second.  
We have civil rights in this country. And this is a civil right. Abortion should be a civil right protected by federal statute.  
 Listening to Gov. Jay Inslee at  his message: clear, concise, logical and smart. 
 "When we get rid of the Hyde Amendment, AND WE WILL, these funds will go to a woman's right to freedom." 
  “I fundamentally believe that reproductive health care is health care — full stop, period.”  
There is no middle ground on reproductive freedom. It is a constitutional right. 
Today, I’m proud to be speaking at  Forum in South Carolina. This is a critical issue for voters — and I’ve spent my career defending and expanding reproductive freedom in the United States. 
Last year, I was proud to sign the Reproductive Parity Act in Washington state, ensuring insurance policies cover both contraception and abortion. 
In Washington, we take care of our workers and families. And we have the strongest economy in the nation because of it — not in spite of it. It’s time to go make that happen for the rest of the country. 
I voted against the Hyde Amendment in 1993. That’s because it was wrong then — and it’s wrong now. All women, regardless of income, have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. 
Let me be clear: Abortion should be a federal civil right. We must codify Roe v. Wade into law. 
 On shortly from the convention: 
 Coming up shortly: on from South Carolina.
Back when George Bush was trying to start a war in Iraq, Jim Clyburn stood steadfast against it. I was proud to stand with him — and now we must all stand up against a war in Iran.  
We’re at a critical moment in history. We must protect reproductive freedom across the United States.

 With the man of the hour 
 Yesssss! I can’t wait! 🙌🏽  
I’m ready Renee. I’m looking forward to meeting you and discussing the critical work of protecting reproductive freedom - for everyone. 
Voters want aggressive action to defeat the climate crisis. Voters want a just transition. Let’s make it happen. 
It’s a fact: Floridians live on the front lines of the climate crisis. I’ll be in Miami starting Monday morning to hear their stories. 
Everyone deserves access to clean water, regardless of their zip code. That’s why I’ve proposed a Clean Water for All plan to close the $82 billion annual funding gap in water infrastructure and help communities like West Baltimore. 
This shouldn’t happen in America. This shouldn’t happen anywhere. 
Thank you for your support Channing! 
Thank you for speaking out, and Climate change absolutely cannot be ignored during this election.
Don't worry. I will. 
My team and I are working around the clock to get ready for the first debate in just a few days. We’ve set a bold goal of hitting 90,000 donors before I hit the stage. Help us make it happen by chipping in today. 
Fossil fuel infrastructure is not only dirty, it can be extremely dangerous. We need to transition away from fossil fuels for the safety of our communities. 
To the Republican senators fleeing Oregon to stop climate change legislation: You are not welcome in Washington. Stop this foolish stunt. 
Today, I’m back in South Carolina. And what Harold Mitchell is doing to fight for the wellbeing of people in his community there is nothing short of heroic. He shouldn’t have to do it alone. 
President Trump’s chaotic foreign policies and perpetual lies have destroyed the credibility of the United States in international relations. Americans must stand up now and oppose the march toward war with Iran. My full statement: 
I was proud to stand up and vote against President Bush’s Iraq War. I’ve seen the people who were injured and the families who lost loved ones as a result of the war. We cannot allow that to happen again.
 Thank you talking about the  having some of the best ideas for solving the

We should be moving forward with the Iran Deal, not engaging in endless provocations in the Middle East.
This is governing by chaos. We need a steady hand at the wheel. I stood up against the Iraq War and I know that America cannot afford another disastrous war in the Middle East.
A few days ago, Trump said the US has the “cleanest air” in the world, thanks to him. That wasn’t true then and it certainly isn’t true now. 
I know this: Victory is the only option against climate change, because without victory there is no survival.
“Jay Inslee stepped up when a lot of other people wouldn’t step up.” — Bob Guenther of Thanks, Bob. We need to make sure the transition to clean energy is a just one, across the country.

Donald Trump is lying to coal workers and their families when he says the industry is coming back. Clean energy jobs are the fastest-growing in the nation — we have to help these people make a successful transition.

Courts make decisions based on evidence and well-reasoned arguments — something climate deniers tend to have some trouble with. 
My big idea? Defeat the greatest existential threat humanity has ever faced. (Yeah, it’s a really big idea.) 
To resolve the fundamental issues around immigration, we must address the climate crisis. That’s why my plan is built on solutions targeted at the intersection of both immigration and climate change. 
Laffer is the last person who deserves a Medal of Freedom. You don’t grow the economy by giving tax cuts to billionaires. We’ve blown up that GOP myth in WA. We have the fastest-growing economy because we build from the middle-out, not trickle down. 
We don’t have time for denial — and we don’t have time for despair. Here’s some good news about the state of renewable energy today. 
My full statement: 
It is a clear failure of the Trump Administration to protect Americans’ public health and welfare under the Clean Air Act law.
This Dirty Air Rule may be the most destructive environmental policy action ever taken by an American president, and it will foist upon the American people tens of billions of dollars more in climate and health costs, over the next decade and beyond.
Donald Trump’s undying loyalty to coal CEOs is literally killing Americans. Today’s action provides yet another egregious giveaway to corporate polluters and fossil fuels.
 is a day of celebration — but also a poignant reminder that the fight for justice and equality didn’t end with slavery. More than a century and a half later, we must recommit ourselves to ending systemic racism in all its forms and achieve true equality for everyone.
Great piece by  We need to create climate policies that put social justice at their core, or else we will only continue to harm communities of color, working families, and the poor. 
When I announced my Global Climate Mobilization Plan, I said that confronting the climate crisis must become central to our foreign policy. That goes for friends and foes alike. The Trans Mountain Pipeline should not be built. 
Washington is proud of our LGBTQ+ community. And we’re proud to fly the rainbow flag at our state capitol. Happy Pride!
Even my immigration plan, America’s Promise, which outlines specific solutions at the intersection of immigration and climate change. And my team and I aren't done yet. 
My Global Climate Mobilization Plan, which is the first-ever foreign policy plan that puts climate change at its center. 
My Evergreen Economy Plan, which will ignite America’s clean energy economy and create 8 million good, family-wage jobs. 
That’s why I’ve released my 100% Clean Energy for America Plan, which outlines exactly how the US can make the switch to clean energy across our economy. 
Thank you, Senator. I agree. I want to be able to tell my grandchildren I did everything humanly possible to solve this crisis. 
Trump says, “We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law.” Anyone who’s read the emoluments clause would beg to differ.
What’s cruel and heartless is the way Trump has lied to coal workers and their families. He is failing these people by not providing them with a just transition as the industry fades. 
Tonight, Trump is portraying himself as a patriot. Don’t forget that less than a week ago, he said he would conspire with a foreign government in order to win an election — again.

You can’t totally restructure the US economy to be a clean economy by mid-century by putting it on your to-do list. This has to be priority number one. And I am the only candidate who has the fire in the belly to actually do it.
Look west for success!
Donald Trump’s Muslim ban was wrong in January 2017 and it’s wrong now. When I’m president, I will put an end to the ban — and work to prevent future blanket entry bans, too.

The next president must make defeating this crisis the top priority of the nation. And I will continue to do everything I humanly can to ensure the climate crisis is at the top of the national agenda. 
We are running out of time. We've kicked the can down the road for too long. The climate crisis merits a full discussion of our plans, not a short exchange of talking points.
Democratic voters say that climate change is their top issue; the Democratic National Committee must listen to the grassroots of the party.
The DNC is silencing the voices of Democratic activists, many of our progressive partner organizations, and nearly half of the Democratic presidential field, who want to debate the existential crisis of our time.
Further, they explained that if we participated in anyone else's climate debate, we will not be invited to future debates. This is deeply disappointing.
Today, my team received a call from the Democratic National Committee letting us know that they will not host a  
Defeating climate change demands global cooperation to win a global battle. Here’s how we can lead the clean energy future: 
That's why, under my Global Climate Mobilization plan, those who target civil society advocates, including climate activists, will face consequences. 
Yesterday, Trump chose polluters over people again — releasing a proposal that would intimidate peaceful protesters fighting back against pipelines. Targeting activists is wrong. We wouldn’t tolerate a foreign government doing it and we can’t allow the president to, either.

Trump’s pursuit of a senseless border wall has wasted taxpayer money and misrepresented to the world who we are as Americans. We will end pursuit of this monument to xenophobia.
America is meant to be a place of refuge for those who face persecution around the world. Under my administration, America will accept historic numbers of refugees — lighting a beacon for the world.
Nearly 60% of undocumented immigrants have been in this country for over a decade. Immigrants are a part of our communities, and contribute billions to our country and our economy annually. We need comprehensive reform with a pathway to citizenship.   
Donald Trump’s bombastic chaos is causing the crisis at the border. In the first 100 days, my administration will take immediate steps to restore humanity and justness to our system, like ending Trump’s dumb wall and his hateful Muslim ban.  
It’s clear: America’s immigration system is fundamentally broken. We need immigration policy that’s humane, efficient, and just. Today, I’m announcing my immigration plan, America’s Promise.

That's why I'm endorsing Marie Newman for Congress. will protect a woman’s right to choose and equality for all Americans. That’s Marie Newman. Let’s get her elected.
It's never been more clear: Republicans are determined to end Roe vs. Wade. We need a new national law to codify Roe and protect it from Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court. 
Climate change puts us in great peril. But there’s also great promise in the transition to a clean energy economy. We can create good jobs, protect our families, and defeat this crisis.
For the people of Davenport, Iowa, climate change is personal. It’s destroying their homes, harming their communities, and hurting their livelihoods. We must defeat the climate crisis to protect our fellow Americans. 
Clean energy jobs are already putting people to work. And I have a plan that builds on the success we’re already seeing today. 
I’ve seen it first-hand in Hamburg and Davenport. The people of Iowa and the midwest deserve a president who knows climate change is real and has a plan to solve it. 
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump should fire William Happer. 
Climate change must be priority number one for the next president. There is no time to lose.
On Memorial Day, join me in remembering the men and women we have lost serving this country so that we may live free. To all who have served, thank you. May we all live up to the American values you fought to defend.
Here’s the proof: We can stop burning  coal and we can do it rapidly. 
“Poll after poll is now showing the same national reaction to Alabama’s near-total ban on abortion: Most Americans don’t support it.”
In Washington, we know immigrants make our country and our communities better. That’s why we must protect them. 
Carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is higher than it’s been in millions of years. We have no time to waste — we must defeat the climate crisis. Now.

Here are the facts: Reproductive rights are human rights. Men shouldn’t tell women what to do with their bodies. Bans on abortion are unconstitutional.
Union workers built America. It’s time to put them back at the heart of our economy. That’s what my Evergreen Economy Plan will do.

These plans must also cover emergency contraception.  (4/5) 
In Washington State, abortion is not only safe and legal — in 2018, we passed the Reproductive Parity Act. We made it law that insurance plans available in the state that cover maternity care must cover abortions. (3/5) 
I was proud to join the  rally in Olympia today. Reproductive freedom needs to be the law of the land, not left up to the Supreme Court. (2/5) 
In every single state, a woman should have reproductive freedom, regardless of her ZIP code. The abortion bans we've seen across the country are an attack on women, plain and simple.  (1/5) 
After decades of erosion of workers’ rights, America must reset the balance that has disadvantaged working people for too long.
It’s a fact: 7 in 10 Americans support access to safe and legal abortion. So why are President Trump and the Republicans trying to strip away reproductive freedom?

Abortion bans are explicitly intended to gut or overturn Roe v. Wade and punish women. Today, I stand with people around the country who are speaking up for reproductive freedom and saying: 
Thank you to each and every person who has helped power this movement. We need fewer than 5,000 more donors to guarantee a spot at the debates. I hope you’ll consider chipping in:

We launched this campaign less than three months ago — and more than 60,000 people have donated. That’s some serious momentum. Help put us over the top:   
Senator Arthur is exactly right. The bans we’ve seen put in place across the country are a coordinated attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade. We will not go back to the dark ages of reproductive rights. We must fight back. 
The onslaught of bans we’ve seen in recent weeks isn’t a coincidence. This is a coordinated attempt by Republicans to ban abortion outright everywhere. This is not just an attack on Missouri or Alabama or Georgia women, this is an attack on all women.
We’re the last generation that can defeat the climate crisis. And I have a plan that matches the urgency of this moment:  
Union workers built America, but their rights have been under attack for 50 years by powerful corporate interests. We must turn that around.

Washington is one of the top three states for union membership thanks to strong collective bargaining protections for public and private sector workers. My Evergreen Economy Plan outlines how we can reunionize the rest of America, too. 
It’s easy to think climate change is just a chart or a graph. But it’s affecting real people, right now. In Los Angeles, and communities across America.
American workers deserve to be treated with dignity. I have a plan to create millions of good, union jobs and defeat climate change at the same time. 
We will build a clean energy future. It will be just, inclusive, and sustainable.

No matter who we love or our gender identity, every single one of us deserves to be protected against discrimination and treated fairly under the law. Thank you to all the tireless activists who made this historic day possible.

Five years later, Flint’s water is still toxic. Iowa is flooding regularly. We must act. My Evergreen Economy Plan will include a Clean Water for All Initiative that closes an $82 billion funding gap in critical drinking water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure. (12/14)
My plan will include the largest investment in American infrastructure in generations and create sustainable transportation, affordable housing, sustainable communities, and smart grid systems. (11/14)

We’re also increasing U.S. clean energy and climate solutions research investment to $35 billion per year. That’s five times what it is today. (8/14)
The Evergreen Economy Plan calls for $9 trillion in investments in American infrastructure, new technology, skilled labor and clean manufacturing. (7/14) 
People deserve to be fairly compensated for their work, regardless of their race, gender or any other factor. My plan gives workers the power to collectively bargain, challenge racial and gender inequality, and close the gap in wealth and prosperity. (6/14) 
And we’re not just creating more jobs. We’re making sure these are good union jobs with dignified wages and benefits. Every American worker should be able to support their families. Full stop. (5/14) 
My plan will ignite America’s clean energy economy and create 8 million jobs. And it will happen in the next 10 years. (4/14) 
Yesterday, I released my Evergreen Jobs Plan because I want to elevate the Evergreen State’s economic success to the entire country. (3/14)
We can make the American economy stronger by creating millions of good, well-paid union jobs all around the nation and we can do it while building a healthier, more just, inclusive and sustainable future. (2/14)

Here’s what we’ve done in Washington to protect women’s reproductive rights. It is the exact opposite of Alabama. 
This bill is an abomination. The choices a woman makes about her body should be between her and her doctor and no one else. We cannot go back to the dark ages of reproductive rights.
Science isn’t partisan. It’s true whether you choose to believe it or not.

There’s no question: The next president must enact the most ambitious clean energy policy in American history. I am running to be that president. 
 I agree. $5 is a small price to pay for this critical step. Most important $5 you've ever spent.
Unbelievable and unacceptable: Our government spends $50 billion more on giveaways to the fossil fuel industry than it does on national defense.

When we invest in education, we invest in a better society for each and every one of us.

Climate change is no longer a line on a graph. It’s affecting Americans around the country today and everyday.  
Climate change is an urgent crisis. 'Middle-ground' approaches and half measures won't cut it. We need a large-scale national mobilization to defeat climate change and grow millions of jobs in a clean energy economy.
Denial is not a strategy. Delay is not an option. We must defeat climate change and build a clean energy future.
I believe that when our families succeed, we all succeed. Washington has the best paid family leave ; the fastest growing economy in the country. New Hampshire residents deserve the same.
States like mine have been leading the way on concrete climate action since Trump took office. I want to build on that success and create a clean energy economy for all Americans. 
Thank you for spreading the word, Lauren. Every little bit helps. 
Here’s my promise to you: I will make sure climate change gets the attention it deserves on the debate stage. But I need your help getting there. Help us in our final push to hit 65,000 donors.

I was going to debut this suit at the debates, but okay. 
Climate change is causing billions of dollars in damage to the U.S. economy; our president should stop stroking his ego at rallies, and acknowledge scientific fact and take action to combat climate change.
Donald Trump should cancel his rally today in Florida and pass a disaster bill. He should acknowledge that climate change is not a "Chinese hoax," but a threat to our economy that is causing more storms like Hurricane Michael.
This is no time to rally. Residents of Florida, Puerto Rico and the Midwest are still suffering, and Donald Trump refuses to pass a disaster relief package that delivers for everyone suffering from disasters exacerbated by climate change.
More than 50,000 of you have already donated to our campaign. I’m so grateful to have your support. We only need 15,000 more donors to make it to the debate stage. Help us make it happen:  
Thank you, Jody. Your support means a lot to me. 
Thank you, Grant. I appreciate your kind words! 
Don’t worry, Greg. I guarantee I’ll still be the one talking most about climate change in May, too. Because it’s my top priority. And it should be America’s, too. 
Donald Trump should have no problem releasing the full text of something he claims fully exonerates him, right?
This is an abuse of power. Period. 
My staff just told me the good news: We just hit 50,000 donors. We’re so close to 65,000 — the 65,000 that will secure my spot on the debate stage. Help us cross the finish line: 
Not just morally bankrupt.

My heart goes out to the Highlands Ranch community and the families of those injured. Every person in America should feel safe at school, the movies, nightclubs, their place of worship — everywhere. Aggressive gun safety reform is the only answer.
Today, I was proud to sign into law the strongest clean energy bill in the nation. And when I'm president, I'll make sure the entire country is moving boldly toward a clean energy future. 
It’s simple: I believe every single American has the right to clean air and a safe climate. Period.
In the next hour, I'll be talking with on about my 100% Clean Energy for America Plan and the need to transition away from coal. Tune in!

America is a bold nation and we need a bold plan to defeat climate change. Read mine here: 
That's why I'm proposing a bold Climate Mission agenda, starting with a 100% Clean Energy for America Plan, that will slash climate pollution at the speed and scale necessary to meet the targets indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The climate crisis is here and now, and we need a president who will make America a world leader in confronting this challenge. We cannot afford half-measures or delay. We need climate action now.
My statement on the Report on Loss of Biodiversity: This report is a wakeup call that shows the stark and urgent dangers of climate change. The world that we know is under enormous danger, and it will be unrecognizable to future generations unless we act.

Climate change isn’t a far-off threat. It’s affecting our lives, right here and right now. That’s why we need a bold plan to make the transition to 100% clean energy:  
A can-do nation deserves a can-do president. And we can solve the climate crisis. 
Americans everywhere deserve a leader who has a track record of results. Check out my 100% Clean Energy for America Plan if you haven’t already:

Did you know climate pollution from buildings increased a full 10% in the U.S. in 2018? That’s why I have a plan to make all new buildings 100% clean by 2030.   
Cleaner cars save families money at the pump and protect the air we breathe. That’s why I have a plan to make all new vehicles 100% clean by 2030.

 Thanks for standing up for the right to vote! 
We’ve worked hard to make Washington state a leader in the fight for voting rights. It’s time to strengthen our democracy nationally and defend voting rights everywhere. 
Our transition to clean energy must be equitable. Environmental justice must be at the forefront of climate action, and bringing solar power to low-income communities does exactly that -- slashing residents’ energy bills in half. 
The first debate is on June 26th. That means we have just one full month left to reach the 65,000 donor threshold I need to make it to the debate stage. Help us get there before our critical end-of-month deadline:

Washington just passed the country’s most forward-looking clean energy bill. Our law will eliminate coal power by 2025 and achieve 💯% clean and renewable electricity by 2045 -- and we’re already well on our way to meeting those bold targets. 
In Washington state, we're proud to stand up for women's rights to safe reproductive healthcare. Donald Trump's dangerous lies are a threat to women's health - and Americans will not stand for it.
Facebook is actively putting our health and the health of our planet in jeopardy. Climate deniers deny basic facts. They cannot be fact-checkers. 
Denying climate change is not a strategy. Delaying climate action is not an option.Our country has incredible capability when we have a shared vision -- and there's no better, more necessary or more urgent common purpose than defeating climate change.
It’s abundantly clear that the United States has led the world in carbon emissions. Now we must become the leader in fighting climate change -- and elect a leader who will get it done. 
Our young people understand that they’ll have to live with the consequences of climate change. Nearly half of young voters believe that climate change is creating a crisis that warrants urgent action -- and they deserve our full support.

No one should have to rely on the generosity of coworkers for paid leave. In Washington, we guarantee all employees up to 12 weeks of paid leave per year to take care of their own health or of a family member. Everyone should have that right nationwide.

Politicians often use Earth Day to make empty platitudes and host one-day trash pickups. That’s not what our earth needs. It needs a strong president right here at home, someone who will make fighting climate change the center of their administration. That’s why I’m running.
In my opinion, my granddaughter Zoe captured the image of her grandad quite well. Happy Easter to all celebrating!

I’m glad to see more of my fellow candidates recognizing the urgency of climate action. But I’m the only candidate who will make it priority number one -- and if it’s not number one, it won’t get done. 
Republicans represent some of the fastest-warming states in the country. Yet they continue to deny climate science and risk their own constituents’ lives with their willful ignorance.  
It is clear that the president tried and tried and tried to stop the Mueller investigation. Congress needs to get to the bottom of what's going on here. Impeachment should not be off the table.
Young people today understand the urgency of climate action, and science backs them up. They deserve our full support -- we owe it to them to defeat climate change.

Less than 2% of the total discussion in the 2016 presidential debates on climate -- we’re going to change that.

Hey I have a challenge for you on in a few minutes. Tune in.
One year ago today, we banned conversion therapy in Washington state. Let’s now end this dangerous, backwards practice nationwide. 
Climate change affects everything. It hurts our economy. It threatens our national security. We can’t afford to wait. 
6 years ago today, I laid out budget priorities that expanded Medicaid for families across WA State. It’s unconscionable that Trump now wants to take that coverage away today.
We should be thinking about these families' livelihoods, not fossil fuels' profits when discussing energy policy.  
You know what’s way more expensive than acting on climate change? Not acting on climate change.

It gets worse. It adds up. It’s time to act.  
A year ago today I signed an historic K-12 budget that invested $776 million into increasing teacher salaries so we can recruit and retain the best educators in the country. When we invest in educators, we invest in our kids and our future.

It’s critical that our climate crisis be front and center during the Democratic primary debates, and for our next president to make climate change the top priority.
In 2016, candidates spent just five minutes and 27 seconds on climate change across all three presidential debates. Less than 2% of total time.

His climate denial and quack conspiracy theories about climate scientists should be disqualifying from being in public life. 
Republican activist Stephen Moore has been wrong about pretty much every economic debate over the last decade, and that should be reason enough he shouldn't serve on the Federal Reserve Board.
We should be investing in these inspiring athletes and the organization that supports them - not slashing funding. In what world is it ok to line the pockets of billionaires but leave someone like Frannie out in the cold?
Last summer, Seattle had the honor of hosting the 2018 USA games. Getting the chance to meet the incredible athletes, like then 8-year-old Frannie Ronan, and watch them compete is a highlight of my time as governor.
You gave huge tax cuts to billionaires like yourself. This is not difficult. 
I believe our nation is ready for leadership to confront the existential threat of climate change head-on. Because we are the first generation to truly feel its sting -- and the last who can do something about it.  
Oil companies receive billions in taxpayer subsidies, then spend millions to stop efforts from defeating climate change. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for big oil lobbying. 
Our children and grandchildren's future is worth more than millions in campaign cash from the fossil fuel industry 
Keep on traveling and showing how beautiful our world is, I'll keep fighting to protect it.

From our ecology to our economy, if we don’t solve climate change, we won’t be around to solve anything else. I’ll have to add “eco-dude” to my resume,  
The ACA means health care coverage for 800,000+ more people in WA. Trump is attacking our health care again. We've stopped them before and we'll stop them again. Hands off our healthcare.

I've spent my life fighting climate change. We cannot just check a box. It must be our number one priority.  
Go dawgs! 
Climate change impacts everything. Already $1.6 billion in damage in Iowa alone. For our economy and for our neighbors, we must act.  
The American public deserves to know the contents of the Mueller Report. Donald Trump and his Attorney General cannot be trusted to summarize or excerpt it accurately.
The cost of climate change is our friends, our neighbors, our communities. When the people and places we love come under threat, we must act to protect them.  
Our Climate Mission Tour Rolls on to Portland, OR tomorrow. We will be taking the momentum of last week’s  with us.

Trump promised he wouldn’t touch Medicare or Medicaid. Now he’s gutting it to build his useless border wall. Budgets are values, and his are absolutely rotten.
Slashing EPA. Nearly 1 trillion dollars stolen from Medicare and Medicaid. Trump’s budget is a disaster.  
Instead of spending your mornings watching Fox, read your own military's report that says climate change threatens our national security.  America needs a climate president -- NOW.  
Oil and gas companies aren't fueling this campaign--you are. Can you give to help me fight back against the fossil fuel lobby?  
America needs a climate president.

Visiting the people affected by the Woolsey Fire reminds me of the work ahead. Climate change has caused more wildfires and impacted too many lives. We need to act now on climate.  
Republicans are of course lying about the cost of the Green New Deal. Their biggest lie, however, is ignoring the epic cost of inaction.

This is our moment. This is our mission. Let’s get this done. 
Americans do not fear the world, we lead it. We do not fear the challenge, we embrace it. And we do not fear the future, we build it. 
Climate change is just as much a matter of character as it is a matter of science. 
As a candidate, I will not take one dime from fossil fuel companies or executives. And when I'm president, not one nickel of taxpayer dollars will go to subsidize an oil or gas company. 
Let’s come together and build a future, with clean air, clean water and economic opportunity for all, regardless of zip code, income, or the color of your skin. 
I'm calling on America to engage in a new national mission to defeat climate change.
