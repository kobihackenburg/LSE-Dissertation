Happy New Year! May this decade be one of peace and prosperity for all.
Thanks to your hard work and support this year, this campaign left our politics better than we found it.There's a lot at stake in the year ahead. But with your hope, passion and perseverance, we can have an even better year in 2020.Now, on to 2020. There's work to do. 
In Iowa, we convinced ICE to remove a refugee's ankle-bracelet. We proposed a disability plan that eliminates asset limits on SSI, which would give people with disabilities the marriage equality they deserve. We remain the only campaign with a plan for foster care. 
We spoke the names of victims of police brutality and violence. We visited prisons. We made clear that police violence is gun violence. We reminded America that so many never receive a first chance, let alone a second. 
We fought for not just the middle class, but also the poor and forgotten. We visited farmworkers and put forward the only specific plan to secure justice for for those who help put food on our tables.
We stood up for America’s values around the world. From Hong Kong to Syria to Venezuela, this campaign has believed in an America that can do good in the world, in defiance of a President who would rather side with tyrants and strongmen. 
We fought for the idea that food is a human right. In the America we will build together, no one will go hungry.In 2020, it’s time for Democrats to go further than defending SNAP. We must expand it.
We defended the principle that America is a place of refuge for those who need it.I spoke Oscar and Valeria’s names from the debate stage, and traveled to Mexico to pay my respects to them, and all the migrants who’ve been victims of Trump’s cruelty. 
From Flint, Michigan to Matamoros, Mexico; from Puerto Rico to California's Central Valley; from prisons to sanctuary churches to homeless encampments; in 2019, this campaign has always put people first, and fought for an America where every single person counts. 
Looking back over the past the year, I'm so proud of the campaign we've built together. We've marched to the beat of our own drum, stood up for the most vulnerable Americans, and told the truth at a time when lies seem come easy out of Washington. 
We’re just hours away from 2020—the year we say “adiós” to Donald Trump. If you believe in our vision to put people first, rush in your contribution before midnight - our most important fundraising deadline yet:

 Thanks for your New Year’s wishes,Tracy. Wishing you and your family a phenomenal 2020.
Political interference with the judicial branch is making the humanitarian crisis at our border worse.I’ve called for independent immigration courts and more resources to cut the case backlog.Every asylum seeker has a right to due process. 
People power is how we make real progress.I’m proud of Chelsea for building community power and fighting for social justice. She has a bright future in public service.
My heart goes out to the people of Las Vegas as they deal with the aftermath of the Alpine Motel Fire. Please do what you can to help:  
Today’s homeless crisis is a direct consequence of decades of discriminatory housing and criminal justice policies.I have plan to end homelessness by 2028—not by criminalizing, but by investing in affordable housing and opportunity.

I’m grateful to be home for the holidays with my family. Hope you all are spending quality time with loved ones. 
While we celebrate the holidays with our loved ones, children and families will be shivering in the cold on America's doorstep. Our nation is big enough to provide refuge for those fleeing desperation.

My thoughts are with Las Vegas and those affected by the worst residential fire in the city’s history.Everyone should have access to safe housing—without relying on a stove to heat their home. 
Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy is forcing families into camps at our border—leaving them vulnerable to kidnapping, extortion, and even murder.I’ll end this policy on day one, and restore our commitment to asylum seekers. 
Deportation should not be a political weapon.This is exactly why I’ve called for independent immigration courts and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.We can chose common sense and compassion over cruelty. 
Dreamers are Americans. Period.Trump is working to deport these young people despite promising to protect them, and before the Supreme Court rules.This monstrous action cannot move forward. DACA must be preserved until real immigration reform is done. 
The murders of Black trans women is a national crisis that demands justice. My condolences to Yahira Nesby’s family and friends.Everyone person deserves to be safe and free from fear. 
Thank you for the warm welcome, Seattle! Everyday more people finding our campaign, and seeing we’ve been marching to the beat of our own drum.With your support, we can build an America where everyone counts. 
I feel tremendously blessed with the opportunities I’ve had in life.I want to make sure every American has those opportunities—regardless of their neighborhood, background, or income. 
Far too often, families of the victims of police violence never get the justice they deserve. This is a major step to deliver that justice for the Jefferson family.We must break down barriers to justice and prevent these tragic crimes in the first place. 
The immigrant's American dream story isn't a sprint, or a marathon—but a relay passed from generation to generation.The struggles will continue. But as we work to build an America where everyone counts, we can ease those struggles for the ones that follow us. 
Farmworkers of all backgrounds still face serious challenges—entrenched poverty, poor housing, and a lack of basic amenities like electricity and plumbing.I'm proud to put forward the first plan to expand fundamental rights to farmworkers and invest in their communities. 
The Mexican American experience has been tremendously complex, and not without setbacks.When my grandmother arrived to the U.S. as a child, signs like these that read “No Dogs, No Negroes, No Mexicans” were still prominent—even in Texas. 
The Sea Mar Museum of Chicano/Latino Culture is the 1st museum in the Pacific Northwest to highlight the Mexican American experience—including those who came to the US as farmworkers.My tour this morning was a poignant reminder that many of these struggles continue today. 
There's a rental affordability crisis in this country, and homelessness is on the rise across the U.S.Yet, there wasn't a single question about housing at last night's  nominee must be ready to address this issue in day one.

There won't be a fair hearing in the Senate as long as  is in charge. He should recuse himself.

Under the Trump administration, homelessness has gotten worse in big cities and small towns across the U.S.I have a plan to end homelessness by 2028—including in neighborhoods like Skid Row, which I visited this morning. 
I’m proud of my brother for staying faithful to his oath of office in such an important moment in our nation’s history. 
Skid Row in Los Angeles has one of the highest concentrated populations of people experiencing homelessness in the U.S.Today I had the chance to return to the neighborhood to talk with people living there about what we can do to help. 
Today Congress must put patriotism over politics, hold this president accountable for his actions, and send a message that no one is above the law.The evidence is clear.Donald Trump violated his oath of office and abused his power. Impeach him.
People experiencing homelessness are not criminals in need of punishment—they’re people in need of help.Tomorrow I’ll visit Los Angeles’s Skid Row to talk with homeless folks living there about what we can do to support them. 
For more than 20 years, the gun lobby has prevented the federal government from even studying gun violence.This is a long-overdue and hard-fought first step to reform our gun laws. I look forward to taking many more as President. 
A shout out and huge thanks to and all of our supporters in Washington state! 
I visited this homeless encampment in Oakland in September, and was heartbroken by the stories I heard from those living in these terrible conditions.I believe housing is a human right. As president, I will end homelessness by 2028.

Even in the heart of red America, our nation has always been a place of refuge and sanctuary for those in need.Democrats shouldn’t be afraid to make that moral case without reservation.

The president of the United States is mocking a 16-year-old on Twitter.It’s clear why one of them is the Person of the Year and the other is unfit for office.

I stand with our Jewish neighbors around the country to reject the anti-Semitism and violence carried out in Jersey City yesterday.We must disarm hate by fighting bigotry and enacting common sense gun reforms to make sure these heinous crimes aren’t made worse.

Trump’s immigration agenda has been a complete failure, founded on cruelty.It’s great to see members of Congress putting forward a bold, positive vision on immigration—including efforts to decriminalize border crossings to permanently end family separation. 
I called on Congress to begin impeachment the day after the Mueller report was released in April, because it was clear Donald Trump broke the law.It’s a solemn day in our nation’s history, but I’m pleased Congress is doing their duty to hold him to account.

Running an honest campaign, one not dictated by consultants and opinion polls, isn’t the easy option.But it’s worth it to know that every one of our supporters is here because they are ready to fight for our real shared values.
I’ve elevated issues that presidential candidates frequently won’t touch—police violence, just treatment for immigrants, hunger and rural poverty.I care about these issues because I grew up seeing how they impacted my community.
If we want to call ourselves progressives, we can’t be afraid to have real values.Since day one, I’ve been in this race to fight for people at the margins—the poor, hungry and homeless, POC and queer people, young people and those with disabilities.

A child died in U.S. government custody. We know now what we suspected then: did not provide adequate care, nor did they tell truth. This is what happens when we criminalize desperation and refuse to treat immigrants as human beings.

The gentrification and displacement of communities of color is happening quickly—here in Atlanta and in cities around the country. We can’t just acknowledge that fact and watch it happen, we need solutions to prevent it. My housing plan does just that.

My thoughts today are with the people of El Paso as the store where 22 people were murdered re-opens to serve a still-wounded community.We must never let hate and fear overcome our love and faith in each other. 
 Free breakfast and lunch programs for all students at our schools. Period. 
My heart goes out to the Santa Clarita community as they respond to a mass shooting at a high school.Thank you to the first responders, teachers, and parents responding to the scene. We cannot accept this as normal. We must act on behalf of our children.
Thank you so much, for moderating our Twitter Town Hall and for all the work you do fighting for access, inclusion and justice for the disability community! I will continue fighting for these issues to be a part of the 2020 conversation.   
I also support requiring transition planning for students approaching adulthood to begin at age 14, as it was before the 2004 reauthorization of the IDEA, rather than 16 today. This would give students additional time to decide and prepare for their future.
Living up to the federal government's commitment would alleviate pressure on local schools and communities. When paired with universal pre-K, we can invest in early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment programs, and support retention of special education teachers.
The consequences of under-funding the IDEA are clear - schools often don’t or can’t hire personnel and create well-designed programs for special education. I would fully fund the IDEA ; ensure that funding is paired with a roadmap in each community to make those investments. 
I would also work with the Senate to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and convene a global summit of heads of state to address the rights and protections of people with disabilities as part of global development and public health goals.
Our nation has an obligation to lead on human rights. I would strengthen which the Trump admin has undermined, restore the position of Disability Rights Advisor and establish an Office of International Disability Rights at the State Department. 
I would also defend and strengthen Medicaid funding for home modifications for disability challenges as a part of my plan for universal health care and implement zoning reform that not only supports affordable housing but also equitable and transit-oriented community planning.
Any effort to address our nation's affordable housing crisis, must be inclusive. My housing plan calls would improve existing public housing, and ensure accessible affordable housing units are prioritized for people with disabilities. 
We must break the school-to-prison pipeline, which disproportionately harms students with disabilities. I will pass the Ending Corporal Punishment in Schools Act and the Keeping All Students Safe Act to end restraint and seclusion to protect students with disabilities. 
I will fight to fully fund IDEA, invest in accessible technology, ensure schools are ADA-compliant, ; end the segregation of students with disabilities. My plan calls for early intervention and targeted assistance to support students who take alternative assessments. 
Net neutrality is an important principle that protects consumer rights ; access to the internet, especially in communities where there's little competition among internet service providers. I will restore net neutrality protections, including Title II protections.  
I am certain that we are on the cusp of a major turning point in the way we talk about disability issues in our nation. This is the result of the activism, work, and leadership of people with disabilities. Count on me to use my platform as an ally to that cause whenever I can.
As many as 1 in 4 Americans has some sort of disability. There is political power in numbers alone. My hope is that advocates from the community will continue to push all those running for office, including me, to address the issues that affect them.  
We need to protect and build upon the progress of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I will fully enforce this civil rights law, fully restoring the Obama-era Office of Access to Justice and creating an accessible federal system for people to report violations of the ADA. 
Unfortunately we did not succeed that day. I'm running, among other reasons, to right that wrong. People with disabilities should not be trapped in dangerous conditions within sight of American soil. 
Asylum seekers with disabilities are among the most vulnerable victims of Trump’s Remain in Mexico and Metering policies. I’ve seen this up close. I traveled to Matamoros and accompanied in trying to get a woman with disabilities into the U.S. 
Current limitations on SSI are based on the offensive idea that people with disabilities are undeserving or looking for handouts. I would reform SSI to ensure that beneficiaries can live dignified lives and don't avoid getting married for fear of losing benefits.   
As for Iowa, it's clear the caucus system is not accessible for people with disabilities. I was supportive of the idea of a virtual caucus and am disappointed it will not be happening. A Democratic party that prides itself on inclusiveness and diversity must do better.
My plan calls for expanding opportunities to vote as much as possible. Every person should have multiple options that work for them, which is why we must expand absentee voting and early voting and make investments in making polling places accessible.
For the right to vote to be meaningful, one has to be able to use it. From polling places that are not ADA accessible to restrictions on early voting and registration, our democracy systematically excludes people with disabilities.  
That's why we need to address climate and disability issues together. If we do this right, the investments we need to make in community infrastructure and resiliency are opportunities to improve accessibility as well.
Efforts at environmental sustainability cannot come at the expense of people with disabilities. From flood evacuations to heat waves to power outages, we see how people with disabilities are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis.  
It’s a tragic irony: we’ve falsely stigmatized people suffering from mental illness as violent, when they are most likely to be victims of violence.I won't let the gun lobby scapegoat their way out of reform. I will oppose registries/surveillance of people with mental illness. 
Mothers—especially new mothers—often face a variety of mental health challenges, such as postpartum depression. There’s a stigma and lack of information on how to receive proper care. It’s in my plan because I listened to people who've been there. 
Thanks for hosting, I’m excited to talk about our disability policy. It’s the result of a lot of consultation with members of the disability community, who are often left out of policy decisions in Washington.Use  to ask questions.

During my time as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Obama, we cut veteran homelessness by 30% in 3 years.As president, I’ll ensure every veteran has a roof over their head by the end of my first term—it's the least we can do for those who have served.

I’m honored to join veterans from across Iowa at Cedar Rapids’ annual Veterans Day service.Let us never forget our solemn commitment to those who served. 
Like the American people they serve, our military is made up of people from every corner of the world. It is a disgrace that some of these immigrant veterans have been deported. I will bring them back home to the country they served.
This  let's thank everyone who has served our country and commit to ensuring that no veteran is ever homeless, hungry, jobless, or deported. We have to do right by those that have made such incredible sacrifices for our nation.

We’re not going to win in 2020 by playing it safe. We’re going to win by getting Americans off the sidelines and into the voting booths—and reaching out to marginalized communities that have powered our victories for decades. 
Our hearts are with the family of Atatiana Jefferson as they suffer another loss. Atatiana’s father, Marquis Jefferson, passed away from a heart attack.His death is a reminder that the victims of police violence also include the families of those killed.
This is the work that goes into feeding America. These are the people who make our meals possible. I will fight to ensure every farmworker is treated with dignity, paid fairly, and given the chance to become a citizen. They deserve nothing less. 
The police shouldn’t be agents of fear and intimidation—and language barriers shouldn’t eliminate someone’s rights. She’s not making threats, she’s making a living. 
I am honored by the support of these leaders from every corner of Iowa who will be true partners in our fight to ensure all Iowans and all Americans have a seat at the table.

There isn't one Black vote, Latinx vote, Indigenous vote, or Asian vote.People of color, like all voters, care about the issues that impact our families and our communities. On this campaign, everyone counts.
I’ll fight to improve the lives of the white working class—AND people of color who work too (as well as those out of work!).Why don’t the media ever talk about the black working class, Latinx WC, Native WC or Asian-American WC? I recognize and will work hard for them all.
In 2020, we will beat Donald Trump with a broad coalition of voters from big cities to small towns. We’ll reject his division and dishonesty and restore unity and integrity to the Oval Office. Thank you to the for having me at your fall dinner.

The Trump administration is pushing an agenda that targets the well being of children.I introduced a plan that specifically ends adoption discrimination against LGBTQ youth. To deny these children the protection they deserve is wrong.

That multi-million dollar homes should be cleaned by workers who are paid so little that they don't want to leave a fire evacuation zone for fear of losing a day's wage is wrong. I have laid out a plan for dignity and fairness for domestic workers. 
My grandmother was a domestic worker. She cleaned other people's houses so we could someday own our own.Yesterday, workers like my grandmother went to work in the midst of a fire evacuation. No one cared to tell them not to come. They deserve better.

Last week I put forward my  criminal justice plan centered around prevention and rehabilitation—not incarceration and over-policing.Today I met with inmates at the DC jail to hear about their experiences, barriers the face, and what they need to succeed. 
My Justice for Farmworkers plan includes a commitment to strict health and safety standards for farmworkers during wildfires. This needs to be part of climate-proofing our food system. Read the whole plan here: 
Among the many victims of California's wildfires: Farmworkers breathing in dangerous smoke while working in the fields. Any conversation about addressing the climate crisis needs to include the needs of those already marginalized in society.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again—Our criminal justice system isn’t broken. It’s working the way it was designed to. But we can fix it.

A ruthless murderer has been brought to justice. I’m grateful to our military and intelligence community. Their courage and dedication inspire us all. Abandoning our Syrian and Kurdish partners remains a disastrous decision that will make the fight against ISIS harder.
In the wake of yet another mass shooting in Texas, what might finally compel our leaders to act? Two more lives lost. Dozens changed forever. This is the choice we make, senseless death over gun reform.
Today marks one year since the Tree of Life shooting. The murder of 11 worshippers at shul, in a holy place, should be a solemn reminder that our fight against anti-semitism is far from over. We have to stop the rising tide of white supremacist violence.
When I’m president, environmental justice will be a top priority and polluters will pay their fair share. We will clean up brownsites, consult with tribes, and ensure hybrid disasters like the Flint water crisis and the Anaconda Copper Mine crisis receive emergency funding.
Today, members of the Yerington Paiute Tribe in northern Nevada rely on bottled water because their drinking water is contaminated by a nearby abandoned mine—the Anaconda Copper Mine. The problem is, like our neighborhoods, pollution is segregated.

We know blackouts and the fires California will harm marginalized and vulnerable the most. Elderly and disabled people who rely on electricity for medically-necessary devices. Farmworkers, breathing in dangerous smoke while working in the fields.
Climate change and corporate greed are a destructive combination. Californians deserve better—PG;E needs to be held accountable for their role in these devastating fires.

Our understanding of privacy has to keep pace with new technologies, from phones a century ago to facial recognition today. We need a new generation of leaders who understand how pervasive these technologies can be and the safeguards we need to implement, including against bias. 
Yes. 
This entire campaign has been focused on lifting up the most vulnerable. Whether it’s youth in foster care or kids separated from their families at the border, we need to treat people with compassion, not cruelty.  more here:  
As president, I will create an advisory council of currently and formerly incarcerated people, tasked with advising me directly on how to reform our criminal justice system. 
As someone who grew up in a neighborhood where too many people enter the criminal justice system, I know that no one understands the realities of mass incarceration better than those who have been there. 
 I don't think I've ever heard a Presidential candidate validate that our unjust criminal legal system is doing what it wa…
These programs are important, in addition to eliminating cash bail, restricting pre-trial detention, open-file requirements for transparency during plea deal negotiations, and ending mandatory minimums, that also stack the deck during a trial.
I've seen how not having access to child care or secure housing makes it hard to keep court appointments and navigate the justice system. Investing in social services can help families avoid bad plea deals by lessening the impact of a prosecution on the rest of someone’s life. 
We should prioritize enforcement on traffickers ; violence against sex workers. I don’t support federal prosecution of sex workers, and I want to ensure reforms don’t worsen conditions for them. I appreciate leadership on this, and I’m open to learning more. 
We need to embrace restorative justice, and help people who are caught up in the criminal justice system become whole, while also helping crime victims heal.A restorative justice system is not only a deterrent,  it’s rehabilitative. 
Many believe that amending our drug laws is the way to curb mass incarceration, but we also need a justice system that prioritizes violence prevention. That starts by investing in community-led prevention programs, like that have proven track records.  
My policing plan ends qualified immunity, establishes a public database tracking police misconduct, establishes national standards for the use of force, and mends the rift between police and communities.   
The senseless killing of Atatiana Jefferson is yet another tragic reminder of the need for police reform, for more training and the need to address racial profiling. Police should make communities safer—not pose a threat to those they serve.  
I'd create a 21st Century Safety Net that boosts families up— including a $3,000 child tax credit, tenant rights, a $15 minimum wage, universal child care, medicare for all, housing, and finally ending the distinction between mental health care and health care. 
Every year, the U.S. spends $180 billion on policing and incarceration. Our money would be better spent ensuring under-served communities have the resources they need to prevent incarceration and criminalization, not promote them.  
We achieve public safety by investing in the public good—good schools, neighborhoods, jobs, and opportunity. Instead of over-policing and over-criminalizing, public safety should be about lifting up those most in need and creating opportunity wherever we can. 
Public safety means no matter what neighborhood you or your family live in, you can live your life free from crime, oppression, or discrimination. It also means economic security and the ability to trust one’s courts and law enforcement to treat you fairly.  
These issues don’t exist in silos—and neither do the lives of everyday people. My First Chance Plan connects the dots on these issues, focuses on prevention rather than prison, and boosts opportunity for all communities.  
Today, the criminal justice system punishes poverty and communities of color more than it advances justice. We can’t just fix the justice system—we have to focus resources on improving education, housing, and opportunity in communities that have been left behind. 
A1: Our justice system isn't broken—it's doing what it was designed to do. The prison system is built on the legacy of slavery, and poor folks and people of color have never been set up to win. In order to tackle the problem, we need to be honest about our history.

 Julian Castro visits Edith Espinal in sanctuary 
Edith doesn’t only face deportation—she was among at least 10 immigrants issued erroneous fines for living in sanctuary. She was fined nearly $500,000 by ICE under a rarely-used clause of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952.
This morning I met with Edith Espinal, a 20-year US resident with three children who has been living in sanctuary due to an ICE deportation threat. I’m standing in solidarity with her—and against the cruel Trump immigration agenda that’s tearing families apart every day. 
The right decision.

Today I'm rolling out my  plan to reform our foster care system. That means:✅Unprecedented federal investment✅Ending discrimination against LGBTQ families who want to foster or adopt✅Support after aging out+ MoreREAD it here:

 When it comes to helping vulnerable kids in  discrimination—against  Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish i…
Everyone who wants to provide a safe, loving home for a child— whether through foster care or adoption, should be able to.No matter their sexual orientation or gender identity.  
Every child deserves a safe, caring and loving family.Too often, kids in foster care don't have this support.That's why I'm proposing a new  plan for foster care to revamp our foster care system and invest in our most vulnerable children.
On this  let me repeat something:There should be no distinction between mental and physical heath care, and every single American should be covered.It’s simple.
My People First Plan for Working Families would invest in a 21st Century Safety Net and ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. 
I'm very proud to be the first candidate to put out a plan on animal welfare. My Protecting Animals and Wildlife--or PAW plan :)--would advance the welfare of animals and protect endangered species.
I've put forward a plan to disarm hate that would combat the threat of white supremacist terrorism and address the gun violence epidemic in our country. 
I believe housing is a human right. Housing shouldn't be a back-burner issue in this election, because it's not a back-burner issue for Americans. My People First Housing plan: 
Climate change is an existential threat. My People and Planet First plan would get us to net-zero by 2045, create millions of good jobs, and support frontline communities experiencing a changing climate first.
My labor plan would empower workers, strengthen the rights of unions for all, and ensure farmworkers and domestic workers have the dignity of a safe, decent job. 
Indigenous communities have been subjected to cruelty and neglect at the hands of the federal government. My Indigenous Communities plan would strengthen tribal sovereignty.
My People First Education Plan would extend and strengthen the federal commitment to our nation's students and teachers--from pre-K through college and beyond.
Lead exposure and access to clean water is a persistent threat to communities across the country. My People First Lead Exposure plan would eliminate lead as a major public health threat.
My policing plan would end over-policing, militarization of police departments, and would work to mend the rift that too often exists between police and the communities they represent.
My People First immigration plan represents the antidote to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. 
Thank you so much for hosting our  Town Hall! I've had a great time answering your questions. You can read more about my campaign and the policies we've put forward by going to  Here are some highlights: 
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a critical piece of civil rights legislation that has changed lives immeasurably. Unfortunately, we currently only fund 18% of its costs. I'll fully fund it, and fight for every child's education.  
Cristián thought the cows at the Iowa State Fair were pretty great—maybe a few of those for the lawn?  
My plan to eliminate lead exposure (the first of its kind) calls for:-$5B a year/10 years for lead remediation-A presidential task force on lead-passing a Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act-Ensuring consistent standards and testing-Revising Lead ; Copper Rule 
Usually on my side, especially if Cristián is kicking me off the bed. 
Addressing the injustice of the failed war on drugs means that we must legalize and regulate marijuana, and ensure victims of these policies — a majority of whom were Black and Brown—have their records expunged and are given access to economic development opportunities. 
Reproductive rights are under assault in this country. I believe that everyone has the right to an abortion, regardless of their income.I will:-Eliminate the Hyde amendment-Appoint justices that recognize the precedent of Roe v. Wade-End domestic and global gag rules 
Housing is one of the most pressing concerns for Americans. It’s insane that there hasn’t been a housing question in 5 nights of debates—especially as Trump is criminalizing homelessness.I’m calling on and to ask a question on housing in the next debate. 
The issues folks face everyday aren't in silos. Poverty affects education, affects housing, affects health care, affects climate change. We have to connect the dots and address the root causes that affect people's lives. That's how I've addressed policy on this campaign. 
 Randall Cunningham was just that good! 
That means removing the structural flaws that allowed Trump to separate families in the first place. I've called for repealing the law treating border crossing as a criminal offense, instead of a civil one. We can enforce our laws ; treat immigrants with compassion, not cruelty.
Our next president will have their work cut out for them in just undoing what he's done on immigration. But they shouldn't be afraid to be bold and to create a system that doesn't see immigrants as criminals or a threat to national security.  
Why would I want to? 
I knew when I became the first candidate to put out an immigration plan some that would say: 'here's the brown guy supporting brown people.'The Latinx community is often pigeonholed like this—but I won't let Trump target Immigrants without speaking up.   
I was proud to be the first candidate to put forward a policing reform plan. We can mend the rift that too often exists between police and the communities they serve. You can read more about it here:
The police should serve and protect everyone. But the system wasn't built to work that way. We know police lock up or kill Black and Brown people at a disproportionate rate. We need police reform that will end the disparities and criminal justice reform to end mass incarceration.
We've all heard the names and seen the videos: Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Laquan McDonald, Pamela Turner, Antonio Arce, and now Botham Jean. What's it going to take for us to act?
Growing up on the Westside of San Antonio, I saw the distrust between communities of color and the police. I've heard the stories my whole life of police who were too aggressive, or community members who didn't feel safe calling 911. 
My mom was a Chicana activist, and ran for city council in a third party called the Committee for Barrio Betterment. I grew up surrounded by movements ; learned their importance from an early age.Change comes from the people on the ground doing the work.   
It's a huge opportunity ; responsibility. I know that lots of Latinx kids are watching ; thinking "I can do that too."  It's crazy—my grandmother came here as an orphan. She never got to see my brother or I run for office, but I know she'd be proud.

I am appalled by the hateful attack on a synagogue in Germany. That Jewish people cannot worship in safety on Yom Kippur, seven decades after the Holocaust, shocks the conscience. It is on all of us to condemn and root out anti-Semitism.
The war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced around half the country's pre-war population. The United States should lead in negotiating an end to this war, instead of green-lighting an attack by Turkey on those who fought with us.

This president has violated his oath of office and abused his power. Now, public support for his impeachment and removal is skyrocketing. We must restore integrity and honesty in the Oval Office.
It’s been said: moms are always right.I’m thankful every day to have a mother who taught me how to stand up for my community, and against bigotry. She's never given up the fight for justice, and neither will I. 
Looks like we forgot to check under Cristián’s bed for radioactive spiders. 
We will also increase the amount of lands protected nationally to 30% by 2030, with a goal of 50% by 2050. 
In my administration we will modernize and codify tribal consultation requirements to ensure federal agencies have a meaningful and responsive process to solicit input from Indigenous communities when pursuing policies that affect them.
I stand with Nevadans, including Indigenous communities who want to protect the Desert National Wildlife Refuge from becoming a bombing range.We must respect land sacred to Indigenous peoples and critical to wildlife.

For Donald Trump, the cruelty is the point.His immigration agenda has created the conditions on our border—conditions only bound to get worse. We are better than this. 
Thank you for your work, It is critical. 
We crossed back into the US with 12 LGBTQ and disabled asylum seekers who should not be included in the remain in Mexico policy. Their cases are now under review. 
What I saw in across the border in Matamoros, Mexico is a national embarrassment—one entirely of Trump’s creation. Make no mistake: his agenda is killing people—and it's on purpose. 
This asylum seeker is deaf— even under Trump’s cruel ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy, vulnerable migrants are supposed to be exempt. But this policy has been enforced at random—forcing many to camp in Mexico.Today we're fighting to grant her the asylum she’s entitled to. 
Oscar and Valeria Martinez died on these shores—desperately crossing the river as a last resort for asylum.They aren’t the first to be killed by Trump’s immigration agenda, and they won’t be the last if we don’t act soon. 
A week ago, of invited me to Matamoros to see the impact of Trump's "Remain in Mexico" policy. I'm here now to meet with refugees, some LGBTQ or disabled, who’ve been held up here despite policies that allow them to enter.

This reckless decision abandons our Syrian and Kurdish allies to Turkey, Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. As President, I will pursue a negotiated end to the conflict in Syria and will not betray those who fought alongside the United States. 
Donald Trump campaigned on standing up for working families, but handed out massive tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.Unsurprisingly, economic growth has slowed and inequality is through the roof. It’s time we invest in those who work for a living. 
China is using its economic power to silence critics—even those in the U.S.The United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government. 
My wife, has been an educator for 16 years. We are proud to stand with Chicago teachers as they prepare to strike. They're fighting for better conditions for their students—Chicago Public Schools should do right by the kids and come to a settlement. 
 Thank you, for writing it.
In trying times—when the news feels like it keeps getting worse, it can help to look back to history.Fannie Lou Hamer called upon people to move beyond prayer to action. She reminded us that we have a moral duty to work to end injustice.
Republicans in Congress are bending over backwards to help Trump deflect and distract the American people from his criminality.They took an oath to the American people, not Trump. History won’t be kind to them. 
Francisco Galicia is a U.S. citizen, yet ICE is trying to deport him anyway. Make no mistake: Trump isn’t just attacking undocumented immigrants, he’s targeting the entire Latinx community.
There’s a humanitarian crisis at the border created by Donald Trump’s ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy.On Monday I’ll travel to Matamoros, Mexico to meet with refugees living in an encampment who are waiting to get asylum in the U.S.

This attack is monstrous, but it was not random. It targeted the most vulnerable among us. It is our failure to treat people experiencing homelessness with dignity that left these individuals vulnerable to such hateful violence.

César made tremendous strides, but the work to ensure all farmworkers live and work in dignified conditions remains unfinished.That’s why I’m proud to put forward the first plan to support the farmworkers who feed our country.Read it here:

 Julián Castro unveils plan ensuring dignity and vital protections for domestic workers 
Wishing our German allies a happy Unity Day! American leaders in the past have stood up to dictators and called for walls to be torn down.It's time for a new generation to carry those values into the 21st century. 
 After unveiling a workers rights plan that called for equal treatment of farm and domestic workers in labor laws,
America’s farmworkers are experiencing a humanitarian crisis—facing a severe lack of dignified, affordable housing. I'm proud to join ; in urging to sign AB 1783 to address the critical shortage of farmworker housing in California. 
The Trump administration has betrayed America's small farmers, farmworkers, and rural communities. Enough. We need to look out for the most vulnerable in our food system, and serve those who've been left behind. 
As President, I'll work to honor César Chávez's vision. That's why I've proposed the first and boldest plan in the field specifically for farmworkers. It's time to prioritize the most vulnerable and excluded among us. 
Like many, I was inspired by César Chávez and the farmworker movement. I won't forget those roots.  Tomorrow I will be in Delano, California to visit the spot where Chávez fasted to seek justice for those who feed us. We must continue that struggle. 
Read my vision of how we'll bring justice, dignity, and opportunity to the farmworkers who feed us: 
The contributions of farmworkers like the Braceros have long been overlooked. Many farmworkers today endure the same exploitation that Braceros faced. The people who feed us deserve better. 
Who needs a transcript when the crime is broadcast from the South Lawn? 
For too long, big corporations have taken advantage of gig economy workers through lax labor laws. As president, I’ll end employee misclassification, ensure workershave access to predictable schedules, and strengthen over-time rules. 
 Or I’ll have to grow one!

Countries around the world have the same video games as we have.They don’t have the gun violence we do—it’s clear that guns are the problem. 
Police violence is gun violence. I put out a police reform plan to make sure that Black, Brown and Indigenous Communities don’t have to bear the brunt of state violence and over-policing .
People in our communities have the solution to the violence in their communities.They don’t need outside saviors, they need the resources to fund programs they know will be effective.
The myth of a good guy with a gun has been totally shattered.In Texas—with open carry, concealed carry, campus carry—we’ve had 4 of the deadliest mass shootings in the U.S.The answer is not more guns—it’s common sense gun reform. 
Our teachers should not be armed. Period.
I grew up in a neighborhood where it wasn’t uncommon to hear gun shots in the night.Gun violence prevention is not just about mass shootings, but also the epidemic of gun violence people experience every day.

 EN VIVO: Declaraciones del precandidato presidencial demócrata durante el foro 'Clima en Crisis' 
 Yep!
I was the first candidate to release a full-scale plan on how to help Indigenous and tribal communities have power over what happens on their lands.Tribal communities are leading on environmental protection. We should listen. 
All of us have a role to play in changing our behavior to be better stewards of the planet. But sole emphasis on individual behavioral changes can be a distraction from the industrial and agricultural reform we need to confront the climate crisis. 
Species are disappearing at an alarming rate. My climate plan calls for protecting at least 30 percent of America’s lands and oceans by 2030 to help preserve biodiversity.  my plan to protect animals and wildlife here: 
Getting rid of single-use plastics isn't about straws.It's about reforming our manufacturing processes, and federalizing the kinds of changes that municipalities are working on, eliminating micro-plastics and changing our culture to encourage less waste.
We need to take action to build climate resiliency in all communities, no matter their economic status. Not everyone has the resources to pick up and move from impacted areas. We have to help people where they are and be forward-looking.
The federal government can be a catalyst to invest in a 100% clean energy economy.I have a plan for us to create 10 million good-paying jobs and defeat the climate crisis.

When people feel overwhelmed by the scale of the climate crisis, research shows they shut down and feel hopeless.It's important to emphasize how we also have an opportunity to create jobs and reshape our country in a sustainable and equitable way. 
We should not be bashful about holding corporations and executives that have caused harm accountable for the negative impacts they've had on our planet. 
I support a ban on fracking, first on public lands, and then everywhere else in our country. We need to create green jobs in a sustainable economy, while not abandoning workers in the fields today. 
The poorest people are often the first, and most heavily, impacted by climate change. We need equitable solutions to help those people, and to allow them to hold polluters accountable. 
The climate is already displacing people around the world. The United Nations has said that number could rise to 200 million by 2050. We have to play a part in finding them safe harbor. My plan lays out how we can do that. 
Live now!

The cost of living is rising everywhere in America and wages aren't rising fast enough to keep up.We need lawmakers who know what it means to struggle, who have empathy, compassion and solutions for people trying to make ends meet.

The Department of Justice isn’t your law firm, or Brett Kavanaugh’s. Even if Bill Barr acts like your lawyer. 
It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached.And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter. 
A growing number of Americans are homeless. We also have a rental affordability crisis. This is urgent.And yet, a question about housing/homelessness hasn’t been asked in the presidential debates.The is cohosting the next debate. Will they ask the question in Ohio? 
Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation is a shame to the Supreme Court. This latest allegation of assault must be investigated.

In 2020, we are going to beat Donald Trump. We are going to fight for what our country can be.  But we can't do that if we aren't bold, if we aren't fearless. We can win, together.
We have to get serious about climate change. We don't have time to wait. We have to invest in a Green New Deal so we can create new jobs while we protect our planet.
We can do right by dreamers and their parents, but also all other undocumented immigrants. We can make sure kids aren't gettingBoth documented and undocumented immigrants have helped build the nation we are today.
We need to fight for a living wage and index it to inflation so that people aren't stuck waiting decades for another increase.
We need to make sure that women, trans and nonbinary people receive equal pay for equal work. We need to fight for reproductive justice and protect reproductive freedoms.
We need to demilitarize our police, so that no matter who you are you feel more, not less safe when you see the police.
We need to invest in diversion programs and legalize marijuana, so that our kids can achieve their dreams instead of getting caught up in the criminal justice system.
There is a life after Donald Trump—and I am running for president to shape that future.We can make this country stronger, healthier, more prosperous and more fair. We can do big things. But we can't be afraid to be bold.

I'm married to a powerful woman. She's a full-time educator— a math coach who creates resources for teachers. She's also an amazing mother to our two kids, a reality-show aficionado, and I'm thankful every day that she settled for me. 
Climate change is an existential crisis, but it's also an opportunity for us to shape a sustainable economy, create new green jobs, and leave a better planet for coming generations.I'll be discussing my vision on the  tomorrow at 5PM EST. Tune in. 
Happy Labor Day! Pleased to join the  for their  picnic to talk about how we can strengthen unions, hold corporations accountable, and support workers across the country. 
Thinking about everyone in the Bahamas and in Hurricane Dorian's path. Please keep your families safe, monitor  follow your local for shelter information and listen to your local emergency management officials. 
Happy Labor Day to my staff—one of the first presidential campaigns in history to unionize. They fight everyday to ensure all workers have the right to organize—except on paid holidays, and when they are sick. 
Because every worker deserves safe working conditions, benefits, and a union, I support   a bill that would bring workplace protections to a million Californians. As the gig economy grows, it's critical to insure that companies can't skirt labor protections.
The work of the labor movement is foundational to who we are as a nation. Labor Day is a time to honor that legacy, and to remember that we still have work to do.Until every worker has the dignity of a living wage and a union, we must continue the fight.

The American people, including those in my home state of Texas, are demanding Congress do something to address gun violence. It’s past time to act.
My prayers are with our country and with West Texas tonight—not prayers that absolve us from inaction—but that we will each find the strength within us to act.To act boldly, swiftly, so that one day our grandchildren won’t believe the stories of what these days were like.
I want to reach out to Republicans in the Senate, who refuse to act, who refuse to move on gun reform, and I want to ask them:What is the number? How many Americans are you willing to sacrifice to the NRA?
A 17 month old baby was shot in the face today. My heart is with those parents.That should not happen anywhere on this planet. It shouldn’t happen in this country. It shouldn’t happen in Texas.
The worst thing I’ve seen in the wake of each shooting is a sentiment like “This is what life in America is like. Get over it.”How can we accept this? What would it take for us to actually change? It happening in our community? Losing a loved one? Being shot ourselves?
We have to be more honest with ourselves. This is going to happen again. And again. It might happen tomorrow. In fact, statically it will. There’s been more mass shootings than days this year.More will continue to die, every single day, until we actually do something.
Again?It’s what we all say every time we first hear the news. We wait for the count of how many were killed. We wait for the details. The motive. The weapon.We cite statistics and call for action.We express outrage over how often we have to express outrage.
This president has built his career on scapegoating certain communities—including the Muslim American community and Latinos.Now, more than ever, we need to form a powerful coalition to push back against his hate and bigotry.

This tree has a wooden gun to represent each person lost to gun violence in South Carolina. It’s sobering.Thanks to Mama G and all the leaders working to reduce gun violence and provide hope to young people growing up here in Columbia. 
I am sorry to hear about Lila Cockrell's passing. Mayor Cockrell, the first woman to serve as San Antonio Mayor, was a trailblazer and a bridge-builder.The contributions she made to San Antonio reached every corner of our city and inspired so many of us. She will be missed. 
Trump can’t even accomplish his signature issue, building his ridiculous wall.But he can’t stop talking about it—and wasting taxpayer dollars on it—to distract his base from the fact that a recession is on the horizon. 
Thanks to Mayor Mayor and other Columbia leaders with the for joining me to discuss the leadership role of the United States should play in the years ahead. 
Thank you for your support! 
I am honored to have the support of eight Iowa leaders from every corner of the state who know these communities best and work every day to make them better.

The same president who wants to nuke hurricanes continues to lie about the disaster aid sent to Puerto Rico. He should be preparing to help with the next storm, not stirring up division with his racist and egotistical agenda. 
Great to be joined by community leaders on the historic westside of Las Vegas for a roundtable at Gritz Cafe—a legendary restaurant that has served countless happy customers, including President Obama! 
Farmers aren’t whiners, they’re tougher than our president could ever be.His trade war by tweet is destroying their livelihood—farm bankruptcies are up 13%.As president I’ll provide the leadership farmers need so they can provide the goods we rely on.
The conventional wisdom around electability is nonsense.Trump is a clear failure.We have a once in a generation opportunity to choose a bold, fearless future.We need new leadership that will inspire the American people. Together, we will win. 
There is only one correct way to identify trans people—the way they choose. Before Muhlaysia Booker was tragically murdered, she chose her name. To use the name she was given at birth in her accused killer’s trial would be an injustice.

A lot of times in politics we talk about the middle class or folks trying to reach their dreams, but we forget to talk about the poor.Glad I could join local nonprofits in Las Vegas tonight to hand out meals to hungry residents.

Trump is failing to enforce the Animal Welfare Act and is bending the rules for corporate interests.As president, I will raise standards, ensure breeders comply, and hold violators accountable.We will not tolerate the cruel treatment of animals. 
I was honored to speak at yesterday’s convention.Unions have supported our workers and their families for generations, raising the standards of pay and benefits for all workers. We must stand with unions and support the ability to organize.
One of the best ways to kickstart change in this country is to send Cory Gardner and Mitch McConnell home. I'm glad to see Governor wants to continue his service to the people of Colorado, who deserve someone in the Senate fighting for them.

Can't wait to see y'all in New York City. 
We also need to implement the Oliphant fix, to ensure that tribal governments can exercise jurisdiction over non-Indians on tribal lands, to close the gaps in the law that allow criminals to go unpunished.  
My plan will not only recognize ; respect tribal sovereignty, but also honor our treaty obligations.This starts with a commitment to federal consultation including free, informed prior consent for projects on federal land affecting tribal nations.
We must honor treaty obligations with tribal nations, combat the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, strengthen Tribal-Federal partnerships, and work to eliminate the disparities in education, health care, housing that exists for native communities.
For generations, Indigenous communities have been treated as second-class citizens rather than sovereign tribal nations, free to determine their destiny. In my administration, that would change.

As president, I would advance animal welfare across the country. We would end the practice of euthanizing healthy domestic dogs and cats in shelters. Instead, we'd invest in a national program to spay and neuter animals. And animal cruelty would become a federal crime.

Make no mistake, the Israeli government just barred two elected members of the U.S. Congress from an official trip just to appease President Trump's fragile ego. This is appalling. They should be allowed to enter. 
 Tonight is the night! will join me and  for a Live Q;A at 8pm ET/5pm PT. RSVP now: 
Our hearts go out to the police officers who were injured, to their family members and to the entire city of Philadelphia. 
We all want our children to grow up safe and happy, and to achieve their dreams. Thanks to those who joined me in North Liberty, Iowa, to discuss safety, common sense gun reform, and protecting our communities from violent white nationalism.  
It is devastating that so many families are suffering, or losing the people they love, while we wait to make the substantial gun reform we need to keep people in our country safe.Our hearts are with the people of Philadelphia tonight.
Americans are tired of division, his bigotry, and his ego. I made an ad to speak directly to him to tell him what he should have learned as a child: words have consequences. 
Steve King has no place in Congress. Time and time again, he has embarrassed himself and denigrated his office.Hey, I’m ready for another Winnebago road trip—it’s time to unseat this bigot.
This racist attitude is far too common in law enforcement. How can a police officer do his or her job well if they don’t even respect the people they police? They can’t. We need police reform, and I have a plan to do it. 
The goal of Trump’s immigration agenda is simple: to make a whiter America. This country was made stronger by generations of “tired and poor” who came to seek a better life. Donald Trump won’t take that away.

This rule is nothing more than state-sanctioned discrimination under the guise of religious freedom. We must defeat this immoral rule and protect the thousands of LGBTQ workers who work for federal contractors. 
This morning I placed an ad on Fox ; Friends in Bedminster, NJ to send a message to on his vacation: words have consequences, and we’ve had enough. 
I support workers because they’re right:  should be enough to feed your family, to keep a roof over your head, and to not have to worry about making it to your next paycheck.

 In an ad to run on Fox News, Julián Castro accuses President Trump of inciting racism leading to the El Paso shooting.
Thank you, Marshalltown, Iowa for the warm welcome—and great BBQ!I will continue to visit every corner of this country to talk to Americans about the issues that are important to them and their families. 
Congratulations! is a talented strategist and thoughtful leader who will continue to build on the success has had over the years.I look forward to working with her to elect Latinx leaders up and down the ballot. 
Happy  to all of you out there, and to my campaign manager who is obviously making me write this tweet.
 "The ad will also appear in the Bedminster area...during 'Fox ; Friends,' a show the president frequently watches." 
 On the road with - part 1.
Far too many lives have been tragically cut short at the hands of a broken policing system.I’ve put forward a plan to mend the relationship between police departments and the communities they serve. 
 Wow, bought ad space for this during “Fox and Friends”, Trump’s favorite program.Well done, Sir. 
Great to see more affordable housing going up in Des Moines. There's a desperate need. Housing is a human right. Come hell or high water, we're going to be talking about housing on this campaign. 
Thanks for your work to feed more than 50,000 food insecure residents in Central Iowa and for the tour of one of your 13 mobile food pantries.Hunger affects big cities ; small towns, and organizations like yours are key in helping families put food on the table.

Activists fighting for civil liberties in Hong Kong have demonstrated their courage, despite threats from Beijing.The US must stand with them and reject Beijing's claim that these peaceful protests are 'riots'—a lie our own President has repeated.
Donald Trump wants to use immigration policy to create an America in his own image.His public charge rule is further evidence of his racist agenda that treats some immigrants as good, and others bad 
Climate change may drive over a million animal ; plant species to extinction. Donald Trump ignores the reality of climate change and he is undermining one of the most effective ; popular tools we have to protect biodiversity: the Endangered Species Act.
When Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides" after neo-Nazis marched the streets of Charlottesville, he was stoking the kind of racist violence we saw in El Paso.We must defeat Donald Trump, and work to disarm hate in the US: 
I’m humbly asking: Will you rush $15 to fund my first major persuasion ads?I'm throwing every last resource I have into this final push, because whether I’m on the next debate stage rests on spreading my message and securing the last poll I need to qualify.
I only have a few days left to secure the last poll I need to qualify for the next debate. So I just launched my first major persuasion ads to make sure every last Democrat hears my message in time. But these ads aren’t cheap. Will you help me fund them?
Americans are tired of politicians who are bought and sold by the gun lobby failing to deliver on gun violence reform. They’re outraged by the spike in white nationalist extremism, fueled in part by Donald Trump.Last week I released a plan to address both of these crises. 
Punishing immigrants for using essential government services is both immoral and unconstitutional. This isn’t about ‘self-sufficiency’, it’s about targeting lower-income migrants and eliminating immigration in the U.S.
It's been two years since Heather Heyer was ruthlessly killed in Charlottesville, yet her name doesn't appear on the FBI's hate crimes list. If we are going to stop this rising tide of hate, we need a system that accurately reports it.
I wish Eid Mubarak to Americans celebrating  and to Muslims around the world.

This administration’s cruelty knows no bounds. Jimmy Aldaoud’s family is right: his blood is on their hands.

I have a 10-year-old daughter. Like all Latino kids, I want her to grow up proud of who she is and comfortable in her own brown skin. She's an American.  Trump's rhetoric of Latinos as the "other" is dangerous and doesn't belong in this country. 
Hey your racism and bigotry do not belong in Texas—especially in a welcoming community like El Paso.   Time and time again, your words and actions only make things worse in a crisis. Do us a favor and take an extra day on the golf course.

“I know the world is bruised and bleeding, and though it is important not to ignore its pain, it is also critical to refuse to succumb to its malevolence.” - Toni MorrisonLet’s carry her message with us in this moment. 
Blaming mental health and video games is a coordinated, cheap denial by the president and the NRA meant as a distraction. The bigger driver of these incidents is white supremacy, an ideology fostered by this president. 
The shooter in Dayton had a drum of ammo that allowed him to fire 30 shots in a heartbeat. We must limit magazine sizes, implement universal background checks, ban assault weapons that shouldn't be on our streets and give DOJ tools to root out extremism.

 WATCH: on the El Paso mass shooting  
As long as Donald Trump is president, this is not going to stop. It is his political strategy to divide us as Americans, but the good news is that we get to choose whether or not we're going to go down this path. 
This 100-round drum was used by the Dayton shooter to kill NINE people in less than 30 SECONDS. High capacity magazines have no place on our streets.

The attack in El Paso two days ago was an attack on the Latino community. It was an attack on immigrants. It was an attack on Mexicans and Mexican-Americans and that is no accident. 
Right now, we have to decide what kind of nation we are going to become. We need to move forward as one nation, with one destiny. 
I'll be on stage in a few minutes at  the livestream here:

Donald Trump is unfit to lead our nation. His words could not be more hollow.  He says “we must condemn racism, bigotry and white nationalism”—but often serves as their national spokesperson.  In this national emergency, our president is morally bankrupt. We deserve better.

Interesting, Barbara. What do you think it says? 
Americans shouldn't die while common sense gun reform sits on Mitch McConnell's desk. He should act NOW by calling the Senate back into session to pass  to protect Americans from more avoidable gun deaths.  
There is a both a serious gun violence epidemic, as well as a toxic brewing of white nationalism taking place in the United States right now.We can, and must, address both of these crises with the urgency this moment demands. 
When Donald Trump fans the flames of hate and division, there are real consequences.Tragedies like the El Paso shooting are preventable, and also sadly the result of mixing high powered weapons of war with uncontested bigotry.

Finally, there's so much more that needs to be done to protect the civil rights of people with disabilities, and I am committed to that cause.

As president, I would strengthen housing protections by:✅Defending disability protections✅Ensuring individuals with disabilities have priority for affordable housing✅Expanding Medicare to cover long-term support servicesMy housing plan: 
I've already proposed a start with my  policies: ✅Fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA)✅Reforming school discipline practices that punish students with disabilities✅Repealing the Trump admin's discriminatory policies
For 29 years, the Americans with Disabilities Act has helped defend the rights of disabled Americans. It is integral to building an inclusive, fair, and just nation and as president, I will defend and strengthen it.

We need to be brave by continuing to stand with trans folks and the entire LGBTQ+ community as they fight for respect, for access to healthcare, against discrimination and violence— as they continue the fight for their lives.  
The police violence that led to that uprising still plagues LGBTQ communities of color, and makes people less safe. We cannot accept the violence against the trans community anymore. We must be brave and honor those who fought back at Stonewall.
The people who fought at Stonewall were some of the most marginalized in our society. For decades after, their work was erased. Marsha P. Johnson was beaten to death in 1992. Black trans women are still facing an epidemic of violence. This month alone, 4 have been murdered.
50 years ago today the Stonewall Inn was raided by the NYPD. The riots that would follow—an uprising against police violence—were led by trans women of color like Marsha P. Johnson ; Sylvia Rivera. It was the foundational moment in the movement for queer liberation.

Me llamo Julián Castro y me estoy postulando para Presidente de Los Estados Unidos.  
The right to an abortion is under assault. Just because a woman or someone in the trans community is poor doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to an abortion. I would appoint federal judges who would respect Roe v. Wade.  
I’m the Dad of a 10 year old girl, Carina, who’s here tonight. The worst thing is knowing your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place that’s supposed to be safe. The answer is no, we don’t have to accept these shootings.  
If you believe we need to keep these issues front and center in the next debates, help make sure Julián makes it there: 
I would repeal Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act -- the only way to ensure that another administration like Trump's could not separate little children from their mothers. They use that law to justify their cruel policy of family separation. It must end. 
My immigration plan -- the first in the field -- would decriminalize migration. We cannot criminalize desperation, like that of Oscar and Valeria, and children who are detained apart from their parents.

Four years ago today at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC, nine people were murdered by a white supremacist. The Charleston community taught us how to love in the face of hate. We should honor their memory with action to end gun violence ; combat white supremacy.

ICYMI: I spent last weekend in Flint, Michigan hearing from residents about the challenges they still face from the water crisis. Then on Monday, I released a plan to eliminate lead exposure as a health threat in the U.S.:  
Housing is a front burner issue for Iowans, as it is for folks across the country. It’s great to chat with Cedar Rapids residents about how we can lower rents, reduce discrimination, and find shelter for homeless individuals. Thank you all for coming out. 
Will media corporations ever learn? Their publications and networks don’t cover marginalized communities nearly as well as they could because there’s hardly a genuine commitment to newsroom diversity.  
Here’s what a massive corporate giveaway looks like. Some big corporations, like Amazon, paid no federal tax at all. And you and your family always pay the price. We need a tax code that serves the middle class and those who are struggling, not big corporations. 
 Last stop of the day! Affordable housing is one of the issues we hear most all across Iowa, and is here with
Muhlaysia Booker. Chynal Lindsey. Brittany White. Ashanti Carmon. Zoe Spears. There’s a crisis of black trans women being targeted and murdered across the U.S. We need to act to protect and support trans women from violence—and we need to do it now. 
Through executive action, I will immediately reinstate the DACA and DAPA programs. But would also put Dreamers and their parents, as well as TPS and DED holders, on a pathway to citizenship—to ensure their futures can’t be put at risk again. 
Six years ago, Pres. Obama launched  to protect Dreamers who came to the US as children. Since day one, they have been under attack by the Trump admin. As president, I will protect Dreamers with a lasting solution at all costs—and won’t wait to do so. 
My People First Policing plan would set a national use of force standard, focus on deescalation, and hold officers accountable for unacceptable behavior like this. 
This is disgraceful. There is no reason to brandish a weapon on an unarmed pregnant mother holding a child. The system is broken—we must reform police conduct and hold officers like this accountable.

Far too many communities across the United States are coping with the threat of lead exposure. After returning to Flint this weekend, I put forward a blueprint to make sure no one experiences what the residents of Flint have had to endure. 
 Thank you, for your leadership on this.

Heartbreaking news out of Virginia Beach as another community copes with a senseless gun violence attack. We can and must pass common sense reforms to end the gun violence epidemic—and ensure no community has to endure the pain that the Virginia Beach community feels today.

Donald Trump is attempting to rig the Census for political gain—a dangerous stunt that would disproportionately harm minority communities for decades to come. 
My grandmother came to this country from Mexico as an orphan when she was 7-years-old. I won't stand by while Donald Trump demonizes immigrants for political gain—that's why I released my immigration platform nearly two months ago.

This administration covered up the death of a ten-year-old child — why should we trust them when they say there are no others? Congress should investigate these deaths and hold those responsible accountable immediately. 
Under a “merit-based” immigration plan, my family’s story likely wouldn’t be possible. A system that sees some immigrants as valuable, and others not, doesn’t live up to our values.

Finalizing the Gender Identity Rule was among my proudest accomplishments at HUD and couldn't have been done without incredible activists. Rescinding this rule is a shameful decision that will result in trans shelter-seekers being forced on the streets. 
This is horrifying, and this practice must be stopped immediately. My People First Immigration plan not only puts an end to the use of detention, it includes additional protections for vulnerable populations—including LGBTQ folks ; those with disabilities.

TONIGHT: I’ll join to discuss the latest attacks on abortion rights, the failed Trump immigration agenda, and the HUD budget released today. Tune in now!
Women's access to abortion and reproductive health services are under attack. This moment demands that we defend against these dangerous efforts, and recommit to defending women’s autonomy. 
Additionally, I will appoint judges who unequivocally recognize the precedent set by Roe v. Wade, and a cabinet that's entirely pro-choice. At every agency in my administration, we will work to protect and expand access to women’s reproductive health care services.
As a candidate for president, I will not support Democrats who refuse to recognize a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion. 
The assault on women's reproductive rights demands Democrats stand together to  We won't let regressive, misogynist politicians determine women's health.

Congress needs to begin an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. His administration is openly defying the rule of law and Congress's authority. Let's get to the truth. 
While Donald Trump fear-mongers and demonizes immigrants every day, children are dying in government custody under his watch. His agenda has failed. It's time for new moral leadership and a compassionate approach to immigration that values all human life.
On Thursday I'll join thousands of workers from across the country to strike for fairer pay, better working conditions, and the right to unionize. Now more than ever we must stand with workers to ensure they have a spot at the negotiating table.

Too often, LGBTQ individuals are still discriminated against in housing, employment, education, and other services. The  will make sure all people are protected from discrimination. should put this bill on the Senate floor for a vote immediately.
Brown v. Board declared racially segregated schools unconstitutional 65 years ago, but our schools are more segregated today than anytime since the 1960s. We must do more to combat inequalities in education—my People First Ed plan addresses this head on. 
As I state in my essay, "Discrimination doesn’t happen only when we mean for it to happen." It pervades our policies, institutions, and decision making everyday. The question is whether we have the collective will to recognize and combat it.
It's time to amend the Fair Housing Act to end practices with a discriminatory impact, including those that victimize people with criminal records. It's bigger than a legal principal, it's how we talk about discrimination against marginalized communities in the 21st century.
That's also why we released guidance that provided federal protections against housing discrimination for folks with criminal histories—a critical step if we are going to focus on reentry after incarceration. Landlords shouldn't be able to ban returning citizens from housing.
That's why we launched Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH), a HUD rule to help communities desegregate ; reduce criminal justice inequalities. AFFH is good housing policy, good civil rights policy, and good criminal justice policy—but it's under attack by this admin.
Black ; brown communities experience disproportionate police presence, and the result is a higher-than-average rates of arrest. Those interactions—even without convictions—lead to housing instability and homelessness at a much higher rate than the general public. It's connected.
Housing policy is criminal justice reform. I saw this firsthand as Sec. of under President Obama. Where someone lives dictates the likelihood that they will interact with the criminal justice system. Racially-segregated communities are much more likely to be over-policed.
I wrote an essay for the in which I argue that we must reimagine our conception of justice to be holistic, to see it as an interconnected web that impacts communities in ways far beyond what we typically associate with criminal justice.

It’s been almost 50 years since Roe v. Wade. We should be expanding reproductive services, not criminalizing them. It’s long past time to repeal the Hyde amendment and make abortion care available to all women—not just those who can afford it.
Alabama just signed into law the most extreme abortion ban since Roe v. Wade in a blatant attempt to overturn the Supreme Court decision. It's an all-out attack on women's fundamental right to health care. I stand with women, and with the doctors who provide them care.
 Pretty comprehensive plan, I particularly like the effort to move beyond talking about teacher pay, college…
Since the 1994 crime bill, incarcerated students have been prevented from accessing Pell Grants to pay for college courses. My  plan would end that provision, and help incarcerated students reintegrate with a quality, affordable education. 
Appalling news out of  as lawmakers vote to effectively criminalize abortion. It’s time to stand up and speak out. We must defeat this unconstitutional and shameless attempt to strip women of their right to make health care choices.

My  plan strengthens programs that incentivize teaching and attracting quality teachers that are representative of the diversity of our country, and pays teachers what they deserve. 
Teachers are the backbone of our education system. However, nationwide nearly 80% of parents say their children’s teachers are underpaid and, adjusted for inflation, the national average teacher salary has decreased 4.5% over the last decade.  
I believe every student should have access to quality music, arts, and language programs in school. My  plan supports investments in programs that celebrate culture and humanities. 
For years, we have failed to adequately invest in our students, teachers and schools—allowing our competitors to leave us behind, and making an already unequal system more inequitable. My  plan would reshape our education system.

The Trump administration attempts to slash aid to nations experiencing turmoil and violence, then seeks to charge them a cruelty fee to gain asylum. This administration has failed on immigration.

Hey, it happens all the time! Thank you all for creating  the first-ever Presidential candidate forum focused on women of color who are too often overlooked in this country and I know firsthand are powerful agents of change. 
To be the fairest nation, we have to reform and reimagine our justice system.  We're going to keep saying the names of people of color who were victims of state violence. We're going to keep saying that  while working toward a justice system where it's true. 
My story wouldn't be possible without the strong women who came before me and passed me the baton. My mother would tell me, "As a citizen, you need to participate in the democratic process. If something is wrong, you can change it."
I have zero confidence in anything this administration tells us when it comes to immigration policy. They’ve chosen cruelty as their guiding principle, and it has failed. It’s time we choose compassion.

I'm proposing a 21st century Marshall Plan for Central and South America so people can find safety, security and opportunity in their home  countries. We need to invest more, not less as Trump suggests, in order to lower the amount of families needing asylum.  
The Trump administration’s politicization of the 2020 census would have serious consequences—including the possible undercounting of 6.5 million people from immigrant communities. We need a fair and accurate count, we can’t let this power grab stand. 
The Democratic Party is a big tent. The candidates running for president are representative of the incredible diversity of this country—including the number of badass female candidates breaking barriers.  
It’s clear the President tried to violate the law in a number of different ways. We must stand up for the rule of law.

We're just an hour away -- hope to see you there! 
I will demilitarize police departments ; decrease overreliance on policing to keep communities safe. I will create an office within the DOJ to address racially discriminatory policing, hold offending officers ; departments accountable, and increase unconscious bias training.
This isn't an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern that has allowed the dehumanization of young black folks across the country. It is a structural problem that needs a structural solution. As president, I will use my executive power to meaningfully address police violence.
The officers who brutalized a 15-year-old child must be held accountable, but how many more times does this need to happen before we hold accountable the system that lets it continue? We need  but we also need  now.

Chag Pesach sameach, to all those celebrating  across the United States and the world!
Earlier today, I told that I think it would be perfectly reasonable for Congress to open up impeachment hearings against President Trump. Robert Mueller clearly left that option in the hands of Congress. 
Whether it’s handing out massive tax cuts to his billionaire donors, or asking our adversaries to influence our elections, Donald Trump always puts his own interests above our nation’s interests. As President, I will always work toward the best interest of the American people.
As I’ve said many times, Congress should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Now. 
Failure to properly equip our schools and pay our teachers has almost doubled our shortage of educators since 2015. This morning, laid out the crisis at hand and how we can solve it.   
The American people deserve to hear the full truth. Robert Mueller should testify in front of Congress and the American people. Add your name if you agree. ▶️  
This report makes clear: Donald Trump is looking out for himself, not for America. We must restore integrity and accountability to the White House.
Far from exonerating anyone, the Special Counsel report exposes disgraceful behavior by Donald Trump and his inner circle—both in seeking assistance from Russia ; attempting to cover it up. Mueller should testify and Congress should investigate charges of obstruction of justice.

Donald Trump is once again attempting to use a political appointee to pre-spin a report about an investigation into his own campaign. The full report should be released unimpeded by media stunts.
Our immigration enforcement system is built around the lie that immigrants present a threat to national security. This lie has allowed Trump ; others to demonize and attack immigrants for political gain. My  immigration plan would overhaul enforcement in this country.

As we reflect on the 20th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, half a million Colorado students are missing school today due to the threat of a copycat attack. We’re forced to close our schools because of inaction on the part of lawmakers. Let that sink in. 
Thank you and for hosting me tonight and allowing me to share my vision for our country’s future. It’s inspiring to see so many talented and driven young minds interested in public service.

 Can’t wait to welcome back a past board senior advisory board member and current candidate for president,
As a native Texan, I know what it’s like to be overlooked by Democratic presidential hopefuls. I’m going to travel everywhere and work hard for every vote, because on this campaign, everyone counts. 
Last week asked what sets me apart from the other candidates. My answer? I'm one of the only candidates with executive experience as Mayor of the 7th largest city in the country and as a former cabinet Secretary under President Obama. 
Friends in the  area, I hope you'll head over to the 92nd Street Y on Monday, April 22 for a conversation Jonathan Capehart and I will be having about the future of America. ▶️  
Climate change will increasingly drive migration and instability in the years to come. My  immigration plan would restore our refugee program and adapt it to accommodate those displaced by a changing climate.

 ’[Trump] wants us to choose cruelty, and I want us to choose compassion.’ — sees through Trump’s immigration…
My  immigration policy explicitly called for an end to ‘remain in Mexico’ practices because they’re cruel, short-sighted, and counter to our values. Today’s ruling highlights something else we already knew: they’re illegal. 
In abandoning our position as a good faith partner in the Middle East peace process, the Trump admin has enabled reckless actions like this from Netanyahu. US support for a two-state solution is on the line in November 2020. 
This is serious. President Trump wants to install a DHS Secretary that will reinstate family separation and illegally end the asylum system. The Senate cannot confirm a replacement without assurances that they will not carry out these immoral and illegal policies. 
Sec. Nielsen operationalized one of the cruelest immigration policies this nation has ever seen. When a nominee is named, I call on senators to vote against anyone who doesn’t commit to treating asylum seekers humanely—including refusing to separate children from their parents.
Join me for a  rally this Wednesday at 6pm at Hemisfair Park,  Trump is going to  be in town for a fundraiser, and we want to send a loud and clear message -- that we believe in compassion, not cruelty when it comes to immigrants. RSVP ⏩  
Sec. Nielsen has been a willing partner in the most cruel and short-sighted immigration agenda in decades. We must defeat Donald Trump and create a more compassionate and sensible immigration system that puts  Read about mine here:

As president, I will keep that same commitment: I will support strengthening laws protecting paycheck fairness. I will also continue to fight for a $15 minimum wage that will raise wages for low-paid workers.  /3
This is why on my campaign, we have instituted set salaries for each position - so that no woman on  has to wonder if she is being paid less than a man in the same role, and we can guard against unconscious bias. /2
Today on  and every day, we must all commit ourselves to ending the gender wage gap. On average, women are paid .80 to a dollar made by a man. That disparity is larger for women of color. /1

Donald Trump is doubling down on a health care agenda that has left millions more Americans uninsured since he took office.As President, I will expand access to quality health care, and make universal coverage my first legislative priority.

I can't be in Selma today to commemorate the heroes of that era, but I am thinking of them and our friends and allies today who continue their work. Voting rights is not a settled issue, it's one we have to continually be vigilant to defend. And together we will. 
They returned a few weeks later and, protected by a court order and the U.S. Army, made it to Montgomery. Because of their bravery, and that of countless others, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed that same spring. 
Nearly 54 years ago, 600 civil rights warriors attempted their first march from Selma to Montgomery for voting rights. They were not just turned back at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were viciously attacked by state and local police. But they were not beaten.

I’ve already visited a handful of states —plus Puerto Rico, which was my first stop of this campaign — and that number will grow as we get to every single state to send an important message: When I’m President, everyone will count. 
During my time in public service, I had the chance to visit over 40 states, which helped me understand the issues most important to the people I served. I want to do that again. Over the course of my campaign, I will visit every state in our nation to hear directly from you.
As someone from a state that’s largely been ignored by presidential campaigns for most of the past four decades, I know how much it means for the people in every state to have a chance to be heard by the men and women seeking to become their President.

I just left Chicago, 45 miles from Aurora, IL. I am praying for the victims and families. But we know, we do, that this doesn’t have to happen over and over. Don’t let the gun lobby write firearm policies that generate profit and accept mass murder. We must unite against it.
The only national emergency is the constitutional crisis created by Donald Trump. Join me in standing up to this administration’s abuse of power. Sign the petition:  
We no longer have 3 co-equal branches of government. The President, in taking money designated by Congress for other needs to build his senseless wall,  has voided the voice of the people. The real national emergency is the constitutional crisis the President just instigated.
As we remember and mourn the 17 individuals lost to us a year ago at Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS, let’s also appreciate the blessing of the powerful young leaders who have emerged and challenged us to fulfill our nation’s promise to create a more perfect union. 
The reports of the President’s threat to declare an emergency to use federal funding to build a border wall are appalling. It would amount to an abuse of power that should be immediately challenged in the courts. This is a  from top to bottom.

President Trump is trying to fundamentally change the notion of what America is - from the statue of liberty that welcomes immigrants, to a country that literally walls itself off from the rest of the world. 
The President's rally tonight is an effort to stoke fear and sell a bill of goods to Americans about a wall separating us from our neighbors. Let's stand up and say we don't want or need this wall.  
While President Trump is creating a circus and stoking fear in Texas, I'll be on talking about what's really going on at the border. Catch the interview on at 9pm ET / 8pm CT.
Don't believe the lies — apprehensions at the southern border are at  their lowest since the 70's. As President, I will work to create  comprehensive and compassionate immigration reform. Join me if you  believe we can have border security and compassion:  
2 of 2/ Tonight, will tell Americans flat out lies about the border and immigration. Don't take the bait. We don't need to choose between border security and compassion. We can have both. 
1 of 2/ My grandmother came to America through this border crossing at Eagle Pass, Texas in 1922. Don't believe the lies that peddles tonight from El Paso.  
Thank you for your support,

 Three-time mayor of San Antonio/Presidential Candidate  
I’m ready for some truth telling tonight. Ready for  
We must always maintain the most well prepared military in the world. That means investing better in the PEOPLE of our military—improve the VA, better benefits, housing, educational opportunities—not only in the machinery of our military. 
7 million Americans have lost health insurance under this President. Bad deal. We need Medicare for All now—everybody counts in this country, and everyone should get good health care when they need it. 
You want to outcompete China? We should start by building alliances around the world, not tearing them down. 
As President, instead of building a senseless wall, I’ll put those billions of dollars into universal pre-k for our nation’s children.  Let’s be the smartest, most competitive nation on Earth. We will make our country better than ever. 
The only “crisis” at the border is the one this President created: thousands of children taken away from their parents and a cruel, incompetent administration unwilling to reunite them.
 Just in case you’re wondering, is watching the  and tweeting out his responses, typos and all. The s…
The President offers a false choice: security or compassion for immigrants. We can have both. Invest in personnel, technology and secure ports of entry AND forge a path to earned citizenship for the millions of law-abiding undocumented immigrants already here.
If the President wants unity, he can start be uniting all the children and parents his administration tore apart from each other at the border. 
Where I come from we’re not front-runners, we’re fighters. Ours is a  journey marked with grit and passion. This is our story. This is our  time. Join  and help us write a new story of opportunity for all:

1/ Antonio Arce was 14 years old, and he had his entire life ahead of him. January 15th he was shot in the back by a police officer as he ran away in fear. Sadly, Antonio’s story joins a deeply disturbing pattern of similar tragedies for black and Latino youth in this country.

2/ Black LGBTQ folks suffer violence at alarming rates. I believe we are better than this. But it’s time we enact policy solutions to prove it.
1/ I’m grateful to hear that Jussie Smollett is reportedly in good condition. I hope he fully recovers. I’m not sure many of us ever will. In 2019, he was violently attacked because of his race and sexual orientation. Unfortunately, he is not alone.
2/ That this happens in today's America is not surprising, but it is no less heartbreaking. This shakes us to our core.
1/ If the reports of Jussie Smollett's attack last night are true, and  this was a racially and homophobically-motivated attack, then  God-willing, justice will be  swift and thorough.

There will be no deal that allows this administration to keep holding Dreamers, TPS recipients or any other immigrants hostage again and again to build a wall that the vast majority of Americans don’t want because they know it won’t be effective and it sells our country short.
If the President wants our immigration system to be “the envy of the world,” he should stop putting children in cages first.

Today we visited Navigating Recovery Center in Laconia, NH, where we heard from those on the front line of the opioid crisis. There the Recovery Coaches are in recovery themselves; they shared with us their biggest challenges and what it takes to build a community of support. 
Took a walk with City Councilor and through Laconia, New Hampshire. We had coffee and spoke about issues facing small business owners locally. I'm excited to visit more cities in this great country and learn about the experiences that unite us all.
