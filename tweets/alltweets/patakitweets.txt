Radical Islam is not "contained;" it is a cancer that is metastasizing across Europe and threatens our shores.

My statement on  attacks. 
Do dem candidates for pres still think climate change is our greatest security risk? Clearly it's radical Islam and we must stop isis now
My heart goes out to the families of the French victims. These horrid attacks are a shock but not a surprise. A weak America is never safe
